 "awd_abstract_narration": "Boston University will initiate a six-week, residential, Young Scholars         project in Physics and Engineering for 30 students in grades 11-12.                                                                                             Students participate in research at laboratories affiliated with Boston         University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where they are        placed during the summer following their sophomore and junior years;            this age group is chosen because of its maturity and its ability to             share the summer experience with fellow high school students during             their senior year.  This program for high ability secondary school              students is coordinated by Boston University, where the students will           reside for the duration of the project.                                                                                                                         The object of this Research Internship Program (RIP) is for the                 students to become aware of the realities of a scientific career                through involvement in research and exposure to questions at the                frontiers of knowledge, and to the methods and ideas used to answer             them.  To this purpose each student is paired with a Preceptor, a person        actively engaged in research, and works with him or her in on-going             research problems.  A series of weekly seminars provides a more global          view of the problems in science.",
