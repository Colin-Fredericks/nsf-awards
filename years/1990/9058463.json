 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work by this Presidential Young Investigator will focus on                 two areas related to the study of solutions of elliptic partial                 differential equations.  These are the analysis of the biharmonic               and polyharmonic equations on non-smooth domains and boundary                   value problems for second order elliptic divergence form                        operators with non-smooth coefficients.                                              In past work it was discovered that the range of solvability               of higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains depended               on the dimension of the underlying domain.  There remains a gap                 in the range which the solution will have a finite norm (above                  the quadratic).  If the domain has dimension four or greater then               solutions exist with unbounded p-norms for some value of p                      greater than two.  But the first value of p is not known, nor is                it known whether this gap reduces to zero as the dimension                      increases.  Work will be done in an effort to obtain sharp                      estimates on this range.                                                             There is a close connection between the study of                           differential operators on non-smooth domains and those with non-                smooth coefficients.  Research will concentrate on establishing                 representations of solutions through integrals of boundary                      values.  This is a particularly delicate matter.  In the case of                smooth coefficient operators, the integrals are Lebesgue                        integrals (the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with                   respect to surface measure).  This is not necessarily the case in               general.  Work will be done in establishing criteria which will                 still guarantee the integral representation through approximation               procedures.  Once these are established, one can then begin to                  study the behavior of solutions as the variable is made to                      approach the domain boundary.",
