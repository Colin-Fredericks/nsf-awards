 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex differences in reproductive behavior in mammals are                    determined not only by the genes and by hormones produced in                    adulthood, but also by steroid hormones secreted by the gonads                  during prenatal and postnatal development.  Although it is known                that testicular androgens play an important role during perinatal               development, androgens are metabolized into estrogens within CNS                target cells.  To determine whether an androgen or its estrogenic               metabolite is the differentiating hormone is complicated since                  placental mammalian fetuses have systems which actually \"protect'               them from maternal estrogen.  Thus, getting estrogen to the fetus               and quantifying the amount of estrogen acting on the fetus                      developing in utero is extremely difficult but of critical                      importance.  Dr. Fadem uses gray opossums as a model system to                  examine the role of estrogen.  The newborns are born at a                       developmental stage equivalent to that of a 13-day fetal rat or                 8-week human embryo.  Hence, these marsupials are mammals in                    which much of the fetal development occurs outside the body of                  the mother, making the fetal environment accessible.  Dr. Fadem                 will manipulate the hormonal milieu during early fetal life.  Her               work will help define the role that estrogen plays in the                       development of sexually dimorphic behaviors, morphology and                     physiology.  These data will contribute to a better understanding               of various human disorders that result from insufficient or                     excess hormone exposure during sexual differentiation.",
