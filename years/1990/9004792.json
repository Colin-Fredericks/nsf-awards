 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photosynthetic bacteria use a single branched pathway to                        synthesize all four tetrapyrrole endproducts:  heme,                            bacteriochlorophyll, vitamin B-12, and siroheme.  What makes                    this branched pathway so interesting is that the four                           products play such diverse roles in cellular metabolism and                     are required in vastly different amounts.  The ultimate aim                     of this research is to understand how the photosynthetic                        bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus coordinates the synthesis of                   the four tetrapyrrole products.  Recent evidence suggests                       that the PufQ protein binds to some tetrapyrrole intermediate                   and is involved in its conversion to bacteriochlorophyll.                       Synthesis of bacteriochlorophyll is therefore regulated by                      the amount of PufQ protein present in the cell.  The role of                    carrier proteins such as PufQ in the regulation of the common                   tetrapyrrole pathway that leads to heme and                                     bacteriochlorophyll is being determined.  When coproporphyrin                   is excreted from R. capsulatus it is complexed with a 32kDa                     protein which is too large to be PufQ.  This protein is being                   partially sequenced, the gene cloned using oligonucleotide                      probes, and a mutant constructed that lacks the protein.  The                   phenotype of this mutant allows for a determination of                          whether this protein is required for heme synthesis,                            bacteriochlorophyll synthesis, or both.  Other hem mutants                      are being isolated so that it can be determined which                           tetrapyrrole intermediate is the first to bind a carrier                        protein.                                                                                                                                                        It can be argued that the biosynthetic pathway leading to the                   production of tetrapyrroles such as chlorophyll and heme is                     one of the most important pathways in nature.  Currently,                       very little is known about how this complex pathway is                          regulated.  The photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter                            capsulatus provides an ideal model system, in that it                           synthesizes all four tetrapyrrole endproducts and is amenable                   to study both genetically and biochemically.  This research                     aims at an understanding of how an adequate yet balanced                        supply of these compounds is ensured. //",
