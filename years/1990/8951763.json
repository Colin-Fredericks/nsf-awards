 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this  project is to develop a series of undergraduate               courses that showcase robotics and vision, a series that will allow the         sharing with undergraduate students the excitement and possibilities of         this important and developing area.  It is hoped that this can serve as         a model curriculum for other universities across the country.                                                                                                   The courses will emphasize both theory and practice; students will be           required to design, implement, and debug systems that embody the                theoretical robotics science covered in the course.  A key requirement          for effectively teaching the courses is a state-of-the-art robotics and         machine vision laboratory.  Since it is financially infeasible to               supply each student with a state-of-the-art robot, they will build a            distributed educational computing environment, where costly sensor and          control systems are accessible from a number of student workstations on         a shared local are network.  In addition to work-stations, major                equipment subsystems for experimentation include a robotic force-               control arm with gripper, a mobile robotic platform with drive system,          vision, and ultrasonic sensors, and a real-time controller.  They will          use the equipment to perform experiments in part-recognition and                manipulation, robotic assembly, and task-level hand-eye robot systems",
