 "awd_abstract_narration": "LAPACK is a linear algebra library for high-performance computers.              The first release, targeted at shared memory machines, will be                  available at the end of 1990, and is already attracting significant             interest both from the potential user community and from                        manufacturers.  This research is concerned with extending still                 further the usefulness of LAPACK by increasing the functionality                through additional linear algebra capability, and by increasing the             user community through targeting a wider range of high-performance              architectures, providing additional language versions, and                      exploiting clean computer arithmetic.                                                                                                                           The extensions include new subroutines useful in systems and control            theory such as solving Sylvester equations and generalized singular             value decomposition, new algorithms for certain eigenproblems which             are much more accurate than any algorithms in EISPACK, accommodating            distributed-memory architectures, versions of several subroutines to            exploit special properties of some computer arithmetics (especially             IEEE arithmetic), and Fortran 8X and C language versions of some of             the most important subroutines.                                                                                                                                 LAPACK includes a comprehensive set of testing and timing routines.             These will be used as a basis for the design and development of a               systematic performance analysis package for the common algorithms of            linear algebra.  This library will ease code development, make codes            more portable among machines of different architectures, increase               efficiency, provide tools for evaluating computer performance.",
