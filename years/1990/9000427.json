 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Regitze and Robert Vold have been awarded a grant                    from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program for research                   using very large magnetic fields to study the structure of                      solids and \"ordered\" liquids. This work will allow us to better                 understand the underlying principles of the structure and                       dynamics of condensed matter.                                                                                                                                   This project focuses on several topics of current interest e.g.                 the mechanism of alkyl chain motion in channel clathrates,in                    layered intercalation compounds and alkylated clusters; the                     effects of specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding on                    internal rotations in molecular crystals; and the molecular                     reorientation in liquid crystals. Advantage will be taken of                    recently developed techniques for comparing the individual                      spectral densities of motion obtained from experiments with                     those obtained from molecular dynamics calculations. Particular                 advantage will be taken of a new magnetic resonance technique                   developed by the Volds called frequency stepping in order to                    greatly reduce the usual line broadening problems associated                    with isotopes whose nuclear spin average is greater than one                    half.",
