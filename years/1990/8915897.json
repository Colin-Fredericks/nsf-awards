 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reactions of one solid with another that occur at room                          temperature are not common in solid state chemistry.  The                       reaction of metal hydroxides with salts is a particularly unusual               example.  This reaction they have called salt imbibition and it                 provides a new synthetic method for the preparation of high                     surface area (HSA) mixed metal oxides.  Such compound precursors                can be decomposed to give mixed oxides.  Because all reactions                  can be carried out at low temperature, the products will not                    sinter and will retain their porous character and relatively high               surface area.  Compared to commercially available HSA oxides                    (e.g. aluminas, silicas and zeolites) mixed metal oxides offer an               entirely new range of materials for applications in ceramics,                   catalysis and emerging materials science applications.  Because                 HSA mixed oxides have not been widely available their surface                   chemistry is unknown.  Ion-exchange, a diffusion dependent                      reaction, occurs not only near the surace but can be an important               reaction in the interior of a mixed metal oxide crystallite.  A                 related intrinsic characteristic of a HSA oxide is its solid-acid               chemistry.  To distinguish the type of surface chemistry that can               be expected from these novel materials well known reactions such                as the isomerization of 3,3-dimethylbutene to 2,3-                              dimethylbutenes, 2- and 3-methylpentenes, and n-hexenes will be                 investigated.",
