 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Microbiology at the              University of Illinois, Urbana to equip a three-semester                        biotechnology laboratory series for undergraduates who have had an              introductory microbiology laboratory and are interested in learning             more advanced modern molecular biology and biochemical techniques.              The series would be aimed at students who want to work in industry              after graduation or who want to do graduate work in biotechnology               and applied microbiology.  The series would consist of (i) a course             in genetics and biochemistry of industrially important                          microorganisms, primarily actinomycetes and fungi, (ii) a course                in genetics and biochemistry of pathogenic bacteria, and (iii) a                course in immunochemistry.  These one semester courses could be                 taken alone or as a series in any order.  Although the main goal                of these laboratory courses is to teach modern molecular                        techniques, they are also designed to develop problem solving and               quantitative skills, and would give students experience in written              and oral presentation of data.  Courses in all three areas are                  currently offered in the department but only the immunochemistry                course has fully incorporated state-of-the-art modern techniques.               The equipment purchased through this award will allow the current               industrial microbiology and pathogenic microbiology courses to be               updated.  The updated courses will break new ground in                          biotechnology instruction for undergraduates and should thus serve              as prototypes for such courses in other colleges and universities.              The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
