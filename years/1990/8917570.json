 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this proposal is to contribute to a                    basic understanding of the functional properties of biological                  macromolecules as revealed in accurate atomic models.  Such                     models are significant for the generation and testing of                        hypotheses directly related to biological action in diverse                     systems.  Diffraction studies on crystals can provide detailed                  and comprehensive structural information on proteins and other                  macromolecules, and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy is emerging               as an alternative source of such information.  It is important                  that the atomic models derived from these experiments be defined                as accurately as possible.                                                                                                                                      Dr. Hendrickson is seeking here to develop methods for optimizing               the accuracy of experimentally determined atomic models, to apply               these refinement methods to specific biochemical problems, and to               analyze in detail the structural and dynamic properties of the                  resulting models.  In particular, (1) he will refine a number of                significant biological macromolecules against x-ray diffraction                 data, and analyze the structural and dynamic properties of the                  resulting models, (2) he will identify attributes that                          characterize reliably determined structures, (3) he will attempt                to enhance the efficiency and convenience of crystallographic                   refinement procedures, (4) he will strive to develop appropriate                treatments for dynamic properties in crystal, (5) he will extend                the method of stereochemically restrained refinement to problems                in 2D NMR spectroscopy, and (6) he will continue to maintain and                distribute a system of refinement programs.",
