This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in  the Department of Operations Research and Applied                  Statistics of George Mason University.  The names of the                        investigators and the titles of their projects follow:  Edward                  Wegman, Three-dimensional Andrews Plots and Three-dimensional                   Grand Tours;  Clifton Sutton and Edward Wegman, Data Set Mapping;               and John Miller, Fault Tolerant Parallel Algorithms for                         Stochastic and Nonstochastic Data.",
