 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through a combination of science content instruction, science                   education modeling, peer interactions, and student                              instruction, the Puget Sound Basin Teacher Institute will                       help elementary and middle school teachers improve their                        subject matter understanding, teaching strategies, and their                    self-confidence in teaching science.  An expansion of the                       successful 1989 summer institute, the program will utilize                      the shore side facilities of the Poulsbo Marine Science                         Center, the University of Washington Friday Harbor Laboratory                   and Western Washington University Shannon Point Field Station                   and the ship based program of \"Sound Experience\" to provide                     an intellectually stimulating learning environment.  Intense                    coursework will be provided by knowledgeable scientists and                     exemplary science educators.  The three follow-up weekends                      during the school year will provide the participants with                       additional support and instruction.  Teachers will be                           selected on the basis of their desire and commitment to                         teaching science, their science training, and on their                          current teaching assignments.  They will learn how to improve                   their students' knowledge and achievement.  Equally                             important, they will learn how to work with and motivate                        other teachers.  This type of institute provides an excellent                   example of the benefits of using a unique and highly                            motivating environment such as Puget Sound to help teachers                     understand science content and become motivated to use the                      instructional support provided to bring that understanding to                   their students.  The cost sharing for the program will be                       twenty-six percent of he NSF portion.",
