 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spatial dispersion and foraging movements of seabirds around                South Georgia will be examined as to prey dispersion and                        environmental heterogeneity.  Mathematical models of foraging and               dispersal developed initially for insects will be extended and                  modified for seabird aggregation, movement and foraging.  Both the              insect and seabird systems involve mobile consumers that seek                   highly aggregated resources.  The application of behavioral-based               modeling to seabirds will explain patterns at the population and                ecosystem levels.  Such a mechanistic approach to analyses of                   distributional data has not previously been attempted with                      seabirds.  The results should substantially improve the                         interpretation of spatial data on seabirds taken at sea.  To                    construct models, data collected on a series of radial transects                around Bird Island, South Georgia, during the nesting season will               be used.  To test the models, additional transects at South Georgia             in the austral winter, concentrating on two species with different              diets, the Common Diving-Petrel and Kerguelen Petrel, will be                   conducted.  Spatial patterns between species using two-dimensional              spectral analysis will be described and behavioral decisions of                 individuals will be linked to spatial dispersion of populations                 using spatially based models of partial differential equations.",
