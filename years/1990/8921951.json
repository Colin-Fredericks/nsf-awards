 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is primarily theoretical, building foundations and                developing algorithms for various aspects of knowledge base                     systems. The topics addressed are: view updates, the theory of                  multidatabases, logic programming with null values, and                         efficient search of disjunctive databases. The view update                      problem is concerned with the appropriate translation of the                    user's request to update a particular view into an update of the                underlying relations. Presently known solutions for relational                  database systems will be extended to knowledge base systems. A                  multidatabase is a collection of different databases that a user                may wish to access simultaneously. A theoretical framework is                   needed to provide robustness in this complex environment. A null                value is a special value that typically stands for unknown or                   inapplicable data. A new approach to the treatment of null                      values, using logic programming, is developed. Disjunctive                      databases allow for the representation of indefinite information.               A new algorithm is developed for searching disjunctive databases.               The cooperation between Towson State University and a major                     graduate university, the University of Maryland at College Park,                will strengthen the research environment in the Department of                   Computer and Information Sciences at the former undergraduate                   institution.",
