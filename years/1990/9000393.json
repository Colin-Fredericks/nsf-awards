 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Miami, Rosenstiel School of Marine and                        Atmospheric Sciences will operate two research vessels: R/V                     ISELIN, a 170' general oceanographic vessel constructed with NSF                funds in 1971; and R/V CALANUS, a 63' research vessel constructed               by the NSF in 1970.  The ISELIN is capable of ocean-going                       operations and operates primarily in the North Atlantic and South               Atlantic.  The CALANUS is intended for near-shore coastal                       oceanography in shallow waters.                                                                                                                                 These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science                  Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.",
