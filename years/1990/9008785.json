 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this project is to develop a new model                 of immigrant incorporation and test derived hypotheses for                      understanding the importance of family and ethnic bases of action               among contemporary U.S. immigrants.  Adaptive strategies of the                 family are a special focus of the project, unlike previous                      research which has more often stressed ethnic solidarity and                    labor markets.  This research will show how the intertwining of                 ethnic and family bases of action influences the incorporation of               Chinese, Korean, and Filipino immigrants in the greater Los                     Angeles area.  This research follows on a prior NSF-funded                      ethnographic field study in Los Angeles.  This research will                    conclude the field study and develop, translate, and pretest a                  questionnaire for a larger survey designed to complement the                    ongoing field study.  Analyses of the proposed model would be                   carried out with event history, least squares, and multinominal                 logistic estimation techniques.",
