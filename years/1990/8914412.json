 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in radio astronomy               between Dr. George Dulk, University of Colorado and Dr. Alain                   Lecacheux, Observatory of Paris, Meudon, France.  The investigators             propose to perform a joint analysis of radio observations of two                flare stars made using the new wide-band, high resolution French                radio spectrometer at Meudon.                                                                                                                                   Rapid releases of energy called flares occur frequently on the Sun              and on certain classes of stars, particularly \"flare stars\".  The               manner by which the energy is released is largely unknown, and                  even the location of the stored energy remains controversial.  The              main objective of the proposed research is to study the temporal                and spectral properties of the radio radiation of flares on a                   small number of active flare stars, to compare them with the                    properties of solar flares, and to infer the emission mechanisms                and the conditions in the flaring volume.  The project will                     benefit from the complementary skills of the US and French groups.              Dr. Dulk has considerable experience in astrophysical plasma                    physics, as well as in the observation, interpretation and theory               of solar and stellar radio emissions.  The group at the Observatory             of Paris has significant expertise in the theory and observation                of solar and planetary radio emissions.  The proposed project will              add valuable new information on the character of stellar fires and              may yield new insight into the mechanism of energy release in                   stellar and solar flames.",
