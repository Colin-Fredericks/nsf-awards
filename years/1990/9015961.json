 "awd_abstract_narration": "The El Verde research area of the Luquillo Experimental Forest                  was severely affected by hurricane Hugo on 18 September 1989.                   Hurricane Hugo, a category four hurricane, struck this area with                maximum sustained winds of 225 kph mostly from the north and                    northeast.  Disturbance to the trees ranged from partial                        defoliation to severe structural damage.  Drs. Lodge and Taylor                 will use this project to establish a permanent 16-hectare grid                  with marked and measured trees.  They will assess the                           distribution of damage to the vegetation in terms of species                    composition and topographic relief.  These data will allow the                  investigators to follow regeneration along gradients of                         disturbance and provide a basis for long-term studies of animal                 responses, succession, and decomposition processes.                                                                                                             These scientists have a strong background in forest ecology and                 are well qualified to conduct this research. The 30-year history                of extensive research in the El Verde area is an excellent                      feature of this project. And institutional support and facilities               available for this project are more than adequate.",
