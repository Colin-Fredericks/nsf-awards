 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grants will help the Los Angeles Council of Black                          Professional Engineers provide tutoring and mentoring                           activities for minority students from disadvantaged and                         other backgrounds.  The activities will focus heavily on                        science, mathematics, and computer science.  The unique                         part of this proposed project is the comprehensive                              approach of attracting and nurturing students from                              kindergarten through high school.  Faculty involved in the                      project are minority engineers or other scientific-                             oriented personnel.                                                                                                                                             One exciting aspect of this proposed program is that it is                      community-based and will employ all available resources in                      the area to encourage a large number of minority students                       to utilize the academic enrichment services of the                              project.  Tracking and evaluation plans will be used to                         monitor student progress through this comprehensive                             program.  Many of the approaches are novel and will help                        increase the participation of minorities in science and                         engineering.",
