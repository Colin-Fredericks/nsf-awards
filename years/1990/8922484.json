 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will continue support of research on the wintertime                  north polar stratospheric vortex, which is focused on phenomena                 that are believed to be related to polar stratospheric ozone                    depletion.  The measurements are made by balloon borne                          instruments, some of which are especially designed for this                     purpose.  The instruments will measure ozone concentration, water               vapor concentration by the frost point method, temperature,                     pressure, nitric acid, and aerosols and polar stratospheric                     clouds.  The aerosol and cloud measurements will be made by a new               instrument called a backscattersonde that has been developed by                 the principal investigator for this work.  The balloons will be                 flown from Alert, NWT, Canada; Heiss Island, USSR; the Kola                     Peninsula, USSR; and Frobisher Bay, NWT, Canada.  The first two                 sites are located well within the normal position of the polar                  vortex while the remaining two are on the edge of the vortex and                in a region where there is some sunlight at mid-winter.  The goal               of the research is to elucidate the role that polar stratospheric               clouds and aerosols play in the destruction of ozone.                                                                                                           This project involves a collaboration between U.S., Canadian and                Soviet scientists.  The project is very unusual in that it                      includes a Soviet Co-Principal Investigator, though there is no                 exchange of funds.  The project has been recommended for approval               by COMEX of the CIA.",
