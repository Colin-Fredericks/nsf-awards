 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel by 15 Indian                         scientists to the U.S. to participate in the 1990                               International Raman Spectroscopy Conference planned for August                  13-17, 1990 at the University of South Carolina, Columbia,                      S.C.  This is the twelfth International Conference on Raman                     Spectroscopy (ICORS) following those held biannually at                         various cities in the U.S., Europe, India and Japan.  The 1988                  meeting was held in London and attracted 600 participants.                      For the 1990 meeting about 500 participants are expected.                       Invited and contributed lectures, and poster presentations                      will describe new developments that relate to both fundamental                  and practical problems involving the use of the various types                   of Raman spectroscopy to determine the structure and dynamics                   of matter in the gaseous, liquid and crystalline states.  The                   areas of application include physical, chemical and biological                  sciences.  The Indian participants are likely to enhance the                    exchange of information given the significant emphasis in                       India on studies of Raman effects and the active research in                    Raman spectroscopy in that country.                                                                                                                             Scope:  Indian and U.S. scientists have long collaborated and                   benefited from the collaboration in the area of Raman                           spectroscopy, a field first discovered by C.V. Raman, an                        Indian scientist.  Previous international meetings held in the                  U.S., India and elsewhere resulted in publications in 1978,                     1984, 1985, 1986, and 1989 with contributions from, U.S. and                    Indian researchers, among others.  Dr. Durig and his Indian                     counterpart, Dr. Hari D. Bist, of the Department of Physics,                    Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, are eminent                      scientists in that field and have collaborated for many years                   in research and conference organizations.  This project is                      very likely to contribute to a successful conference.",
