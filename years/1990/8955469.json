 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Kentucky will initiate two-week, residential, Young           Scholars project in Engineering for 20 students in the 12th grade.                                                                                              This project introduces participants to the engineering profession,             encouraging them to pursue careers in engineering fields.  The program          consists of discussion sessions, a team project, laboratory experiences,        field trips, and lectures to thoroughly acquaint the students with              varied engineering disciplines, career opportunities, required                  educational preparation, and ethical practices of the engineering               profession.  Students receive daily instruction in a computer laboratory        and in basic engineering physics.  Students are expected to complete an         individual project during the fall semester at their home school and            then return to campus for seminar presentations of those projects in            late February, 1991, to coincide with National Engineers' Week.                 Community recognition for program participation and continuous                  communication between the students and the University enhances follow-up        activities.",
