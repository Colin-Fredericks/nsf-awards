These mathematicians intend to work on the general area of                      integral finite group rings and the representation theory of                    semisimple algebraic groups in characteristic p > 0.  More                      specifically, they aim to work on the isomorphism problem                       first posed by Graham Higman in 1940.  Briefly stated, the                      isomorphism problem asks, \"when does an isomorphism of two                      integral finite group rings imply the groups are isomorphic?\"                                                                                                   The PI's are justly recognized for their leadership in                          attacking this important problem.  In 1984 they partially                       solved the problem in the affirmative for finite nilpotent                      groups and recently provided a counter-example to the related                   Zassenhaus conjecture.  The investigators are now at the                        stage where they have developed the techniques and tools                        necessary to resolve the problem and, more important, to                        provide a framework for proving that the isomorphism problem                    \"usually\" has a positive answer.",
