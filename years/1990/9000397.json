 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports the travel of four Indian                   scientists to the U.S. to participate in an international                       conference on \"High Energy Gamma Ray Astronomy\", planned for                    October 2 to 5, 1990 in Ann Arbor, MI.  The conference will                     review the data which are now becoming available from a                         number of upgraded detectors which will provide a new look at                   a number of astrophysical objects such as Hercules x1, Cygnus                   x3, SN 1987.  Topics of the conference will include:                            Observational data from accreting binary systems and isolated                   pulsars; Theoretical models of gamma-ray production; Diffuse                    cosmic-ray sources of high energy gamma-rays; Dark matter                       sources of gamma-rays; Implications of results for elementary                   particle physics; and Proposed new gamma-ray and neutrino                       detectors.  The proposed Indian participants are senior and                     well-known physicists who should contribute to the                              discussions in the conference and benefit from the                              participation.                                                                                                                                                  Scope:  The topic of the conference is in a field where the                     Indian scientific community is active.  The selected                            scientists are likely to increase collaborative research                        between the U.S. and India and to help advance the field.                       The support of their travel fits well with the objectives of                    the U.S.-India Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                     Funding:  Grant PHY89-21708 provides U.S.$4,000 for support                     of the conference organization.  This action provides $10,000                   in Indian currency for the travel of the Indian scientists.",
