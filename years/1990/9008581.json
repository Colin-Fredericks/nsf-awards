 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research establishes a formal methodology for                         designing and implementing highly interactive systems that is                   based on knowledge of both application programs and interface                   software.  To demonstrate feasibility, it the methodology is                    applied to systematically resolve design and implementation                     trade-offs between the conflicting goals of supporting highly                   interactive graphic interfaces and achieving maximum separation                 between user interface software and application programs.  The                  methodology replaces traditional partitioning of the development                task with partitioning of the interactive system.  Mechanisms                   progressively transform design information from an initial                      description of interaction requirements to components of the                    software interface between the user interface and application.                  These mechanisms capture the knowledge required to build this                   interface.  A design information representation describes the                   information required to resolve separation trade-offs.  These                   results are implemented as a tool that demonstrates the                         methodology.",
