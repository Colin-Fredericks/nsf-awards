The objective of this project, conducted in companion between                   the University of Texas (UT) and the H. J. Degenkolb                            Associates (HJD) is to study the performance of industrial                      buildings and their contents during the Loma Prieta                             earthquake.  The primary focus will be on facilities in high-                   tech industries.  The data gathered will be used to examine                     structural design criterial associated with providing safety                    and life.  The requirements that should be given to                             maintenance of operations when designing or retrofitting a                      structure will be defined quantitavely.                                                                                                                         The investigation will involve three major tasks:    (1) A                      field study of damaged buildings/contents and the work done                     to restore operations, including cost data by (HJD and UT),                     (2) Gather details of selected existing structures to                           determine problem areas and to evaluate the redesigns actually                  used those proposed for the structure (HJD and UT) and (3) for                  selected structures, conduct detailed analyses of the existing                  and redesigned structures using models based on available test                  data for strengthened or repaired structural elements (by UT).                                                                                                  It is anticipated that the project will make access to data,                    determine feasibility of retrofitting to standards, result in                   improved understanding of vulnerability of critical                             industries, and identify long-term experimental and analytical                  research needs for operation maintaining and rapid post-event                   recovery.",
