Chang, University of                                       Massachusetts and Professor Yuan Jian-Xin, Institute                            of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of                                  Science.  This proposal plans to study mechanical                               behavior of loess and is jointly sponsored by NSF                               and Chinese Academy of Sciences.  China has some of                             the world's largest and best known loess deposits.                              The Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics (IRSM),                                the Chinese Academy of Science, at Wuhan, China has                             been actively researching the mechanical properties                             of these soils.  It has a large quantity of                                     experimental and field data.  Dr. Chang has                                     developed models that can account for many structural                           features in loess.  The data available from the                                 Chinese collaborative institute can validate and                                improve his models.  Both the U.S. and China                                    collaborators can greatly benefit from this                                     collaboration and jointly they can enhance the                                  understanding of the mechanical behavior of such                                soil.",
