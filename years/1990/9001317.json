 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at Arizona               State University to establish a program to give undergraduates                  individual mentoring and a rewarding experience doing research on               the physiological bases of behavior.  All participants will                     integrate their work into a broad perspective encompassing both                 mechanisms and evolution of behavior, and all will be introduced                to both laboratory and field studies.  During the ten summer weeks              of the program ten  undergraduate students will work with six                   participating faculty members to design a research project, to                  implement it, and to report their results.  Faculty and students                will meet weekly as a group to discuss research in progress.  Some              social and cultural events are planned, in order to strengthen a                feeling of collegiality.  Students will be recruited nationally and             selected on the basis of interest and preparation.  Special efforts             will be made to recruit women and minorities, the latter                        particularly from institutions in the southwest.  This Research                 Experience for Undergraduates award will give 10 students a lively              research experience, including opportunities to discuss their work,             as well as providing incentive to enhance on-going efforts of                   faculty in the Department of Zoology to involve undergraduates in               research.",
