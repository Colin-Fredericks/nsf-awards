 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urechis caupo, a worm-like animal, occurs in dense populations in three         northern Californian mudflat environments which often show high levels          of toxic hydrogen sulfide and low levels of oxygen. The intent of the           proposed research is to characterize the environment of these animals           and to use this information to design laboratory experiments                    investigating the biochemical basis for the adaptations that allow              these animals to flourish in a seemingly inhospitable habitat.                                                                                                  Sulfide and oxygen levels will be measured in the animal's environment          and tolerance to high sulfide and low oxygen will be determined in the          laboratory.  Possible avenues of sulfide entry into the animal's body           will be explored by examining skin and respiratory organ permeability           to sulfide.  The chemical fate of internal sulfide will be followed,            characterized, and the ultimate endproduct of sulfide detoxification            determined.  In this way the path of toxic sulfide will be followed             from entry into the animal as a poisonous compound to removal as a              benign wasteproduct.  The physiological mechanisms employed by this             animal are potentially important in the elucidation of the adaptive             strategies that allow large populations of invertebrates to flourish in         sulfide-laden environments.  Additionally, this research involves a new         detoxification function for hemoglobin, a well studied and critically           important transport protein.",
