 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates how legislatures determine outcomes - -the            level of the budget or the toughness of an environmental law, for               example.  There are two basic views on this question.  The first states         that the majority rules: a coalition develops that can pass what it             favors.  The second view argues that legislators compromise among               themselves to find a result that maximizes the net benefits to the              legislators as a whole.  The two perspectives have very different               implications for American politics. Under the first, a small majority           could take advantage of the minority by passing something that greatly          harmed them - - or their constituents. Parties and coalitions should be         extremely important, as they determine \"who will win.\"  Under the               second view, compromise occurs based on each legislator's view of the           relative importance of the issue, and ideology is not important. It is          also possible that in reality both views have some validity.                                                                                                    In this research investigation the first task is to describe the views          precisely and formally, to be clear on just what each assumes and what          each implies.  This work leads to the second major task of the                  research: testing which of these views is more empirically accurate.            For this purpose the investigator uses a \"comparative statics\" approach         - - showing how some specific change in underlying conditions implies a         change in outcomes.  For example, a change in the number of Democratic          Senators may have an effect on the defense budget, other things held            constant.  The size of these effects can then be tested empirically.            But, most interesting, sometimes the two views have very different              conclusions about what will happen.  When the\"status quo\" changes, for          instance, the majority rule view often predicts that a bill will                replace the \"status quo\" with a different final outcome from the one            originally preferred - - even though preferences have not changed.  In          contrast, the compromise view invariably predicts a change back to the          originally preferred outcome.  The different views can be most easily           tested on experimental data collected previously to test other theories         of how committees function.                                                                                                                                     These data are a \"gold-mine\" of results where the preferences of the            \"legislators\" are known, and the outcomes are known.  Preliminary               investigation has found several cases in which comparative statics              results support the compromise view.  There are also several cases in           which the results contradict all current theories; this may lead to             better theories in the future.  Finally, the different views can be             tested on Congressional roll-call data. The researcher has chosen to            focus on one policy issue of the late 1970s, which provides a                   considerable number of roll call votes over several Congresses.  The            different theories predict that as members of Congress are replaced,            the outcome will change - - in different ways.  Therefore, this will            permit a fairly direct test of the two views of legislatures.  If no            unexpected difficulties arise, this method would allow investigators to         see how responsive the Congress is to changes in the views of the               public - shown by changes in members of Congress at election time.",
