 "awd_abstract_narration": "Melatonin is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland                and known to have an important role in the regulation of                        mammalian reproduction.  This hormone also influences circadian                 rhythmicity in a number of species, including humans.  The                      regulation of melatonin production by the circadian timing system               has been studied extensively as have the biochemical mechanisms                 in the pineal which are necessary for melatonin biosynthesis.                   The major enigma remaining in understanding the role of melatonin               has been identification of its sites and mechanism of action.                   Dr. Weaver has developed and validated a quantitative                           autoradiographic method using an iodinated melatonin to localize                its sites of action in the brain.  He will use this technique to                characterize the melatonin binding sites in the central nervous                 system and then correlate changes in binding activity within                    specific neuronal structures with various physiological                         conditions.  Understanding the sites and mechanism of melatonin                 action has wide-ranging implications, as the hormone modulates                  circadian rhythmicity in humans and may be useful in treating                   conditions associated with abnormalities of biological rhythms,                 such as jet lag and depression.  Furthermore, elucidating the                   mechanism by which melatonin regulates reproduction in animals                  that breed seasonally may reveal general mechanisms for the                     regulation of reproduction applicable to domestic farm animals.                 Basic research into the sites and mechanisms of melatonin action                is a necessary first step towards these goals.",
