 "awd_abstract_narration": "The information derived from this investigation will be                         applicable to such diverse problems as the origin of island arc                 volcanic series and the trace element characteristics of the                    mantle as well as being applicable to the understanding of the                  formation and evolution of the majority of volcanic rocks on                    earth.  In addition, this data will be used to calculate mineral-               liquid expressions to improve our existing model for the                        simulation of igneous differentiation.                                          To understand the evolution of natural volcanic magmas, we must                 understand the chemical relationship between the magmatic liquid                and the minerals that crystallize from it.  At present, there is                not enough data to define this chemical relationship for major                  and trace elements for several important minerals in basalt                     magmas.  The focus of our proposed two-year project is to                       determine experimentally the mineral-liquid relationship for                    magnetite and ilmenite in natural silicate liquids that range in                composition from basalt to dacite.  Our knowledge of trace                      element behavior in magmas that crystallize magnetite and                       ilmenite is largely restricted to a few experiments and to                      measurements on mechanically separated oxides.  The published                   results of these studies can vary by a factor of 100 for a given                element.  Our two objectives are to define magnetite and                        ilmenite-liquid phase equilibria, and to determine the                          geochemical behavior of several trace elements between magnetite,               ilmenite and magmatic liquid.  The trace elements to be studied                 include members of the first transition series (V, Ti, Ni, Sc)                  and the high field strength elements (Hf, Zr, Nb, Ta, Th, U).  We               will determine the major and trace element compositions of the                  magnetite and co-existing glass by electron microprobe.  The                    concentration of the trace elements will be raised above the                    detection limits of the microprobe by adding pure oxides of those               elements to the samples in the O.5-1.O% range.  In addition, low                concentration dopant (10-200 ppm) experiments will be conducted                 and analyzed by ion probe.  Most experiments will be done at 1-                 atm.  However, to test the effect of pressure, experiments will                 be conducted at 5, 10, 15, and 25 kb on three of the starting                   compositions.  The range of oxide saturation and oxide                          composition will be extended by Ti and Fe addition, and by using                a range of oxygen fugacities.",
