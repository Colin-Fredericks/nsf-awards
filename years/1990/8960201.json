 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing demand for instrumentation that can                     detect, in-situ, very low concentrations of organic chemical                    contaminants in water. The increased monitoring requirements and                lowered detection limits being imposed by the Environmental                     Protection Agency, as well and many states, are rapidly making                  existing detection instrumental obsolete.  Real-time monitoring                 of parts-per-billion (ppb) concentrations of aromatic                           hydrocarbons in groundwater is a difficult task.                                     In the laboratory, accurate measurement of very low                        concentrations of dissolved organics has required the development               of powerful analytical tools.  EPA approved methods use gas                     chromatography to accomplish these separations.  However, the                   sensitive techniques employed are expensive and not suited to on-               site monitoring of organic contaminants in groundwater.                              One of the most exciting recent analytical approaches is a                 blend of fiber optic and electrode technologies into what are                   called \"optrodes\".  Cape Cod Associates will investgate the                     feasibility of developing an innovative optrode device for the                  detection, identification, and quantification of trace levels of                chemical contaminants in water. This fiber optic-based instrument               will have a rapid response detector that can measure contaminant                concentrations in parts per billion.                                                 Potential applications for this device would include:                      detection of pollutants in groundwater landfill plumes, detection               of chemicals in cooling water systems as well as hazardous waste                site monitoring, and general water quality assessment.                               Cape Cod Associates has been involved in highly innovative                 environmental, polymer, and materials research for numerous                     federal and state agencies. It is likely to continue to make                    significant contributions in its chosen area of R&D.",
