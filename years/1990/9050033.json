 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GMI Management & Engineering Institute has developed a human                network based in Michigan which includes major employers,                       university professors and administrators, associations of                       professional engineers, five city school districts (in primarily                minority dominated areas), organized labor, and community                       organizations.   The network is dedicated to the task of                        improving science and mathematics education in inner-city                       schools grades 7-12 by focussing on three related strategies.                                                                                                   The first strategy is directed to affecting culture changes                     within the participating inner-city school communities.                                                                                                         The second strategy is to assemble a team of outstanding                        instructors to deliver four innovative  courses via live,                       interactive satellite transmission.  Three of the courses are                   based on NSF sponsored projects:  MSU Middle Grades Mathematics                 Project, Lawrence Hall-Foss Physical Science for Middle School,                 and High School Algebra. The fourth course, high school physical                science, was developed by a science committee of the University                 of Michigan faculty.                                                                                                                                            The third strategy is to establish a mentoring system between                   scientists and mathematicians and students and school teachers                  to enhance the course content and the teacher's knowledge and to                provide professional development opportunities for them.                                                                                                        The Detroit-based pilot project, which will run for six months,                 includes ten schools (five high school, five middle schools) in                 five school districts and involves 24 teachers and 1040                         students. Cost sharing in the amount of $466,500 is 300% of the                 NSF contribution.",
