 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demoic acid, a potent neurotoxin, has been isolated from the                    diatom species Nitzschia pungens (phytoplankton) under certain                  environmental conditions, particularly silica depletion. When                   this species is ingested by shellfish, it is concentrated and                   represents a neurological hazard to any human who consumes them.                This phenomenon was brought to the awareness of the public during               an episode of poisonings in Prince Edward Island, Canada after                  eating mussels. This recent linkage of demoic acid with shellfish               poisoning ( within the last two years) is of particular concern                 since the diatom Nitzschia pungens  var. multiseries is a                       ubiquitous species thriving in many of our coastal waters. Dr.                  Fryxel has succeded in cloning the organism both from the                       Canadian bloom as well as from Galveston Bay. Because there is                  virtually nothing known about the regulation of the toxin                       production in this species especially with regard to life cycle                 stages, it is critical that the cycles of demoic acid production                be worked out.",
