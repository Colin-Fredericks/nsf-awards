 "awd_abstract_narration": "Absorbance spectroscopy is widely used in many fields and lower limits          of detection are currently set by limits of sensitivity and                     reproducability of available instruments.  An instrument with                   significantly improved sensitivity would extend use of many existing            procedures and permit use of others not currently employed due to               instrumental limitations.                                                                                                                                       Wavelength modulation spectrophotometry has been used in a number of            applications and has a great ability to reduce some types of noise.             The proposed work will continue the development of a technique using            wavelength modulation spectrophotometry to monitor kinetic assays by            accurately measuring minute changes in sample absorbance.  Phase I              research demonstrated feasibility of such an approach by constructing           and operating an experimental model of an instrument which used novel           methods of eliminating spurious amplitude modulation effects that               normally accompany wavelength modulation.  The performance results              were: noise = 6.1 x 10-6 A RMS at A = 0; max. practical sensitivity =           10-3 A full scale; drift = 0.4 x 10-6  A/min.  The noise and                    sensitivity of this experimental instrument surpass the best reports            in the literature, and obserations during operation of the instrument           suggest much potential for further improvement of these parameters.                                                                                             Phase II research will center around two objectives:  1) reduction of           instrument drift, noise, and inaccuracy and 2) evaluation of                    instrument performance over the full range of expected operating                conditions.  At successful conclusion of Phase II, we will have                 demonstrated instrument noise below 2x10-6 A RMS at A = 0; drift below          0.1 x 10-6 A per minute, and accuracy 5% of full scale.  These goals            will be achieved by investigations of noise and drift and subsequent            instrument modification to improve performance.",
