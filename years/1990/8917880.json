 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyanobacterial (blue-green algal) nuisance blooms frequently               proliferate and persist for extensive (weeks to months) periods                 in eutrophic waters.  Bloom populations characteristically form                 close associations with diverse microorganisms, including                       heterotrophic bacteria and protozoans, during various stages of                 bloom development and proliferation.  Traditionally, such                       associations have been considered to represent degrees of                       microbial antagonism.  However, current work has shown that                     mutually-beneficial impacts may in fact predominate.  Maximum                   cyanobacterial photosynthetic growth and N2 fixation rates often                accompany extensive bacterial and protozoan colonization of the                 cyanobacterial phycosphere.  Specific cyanobacterial-microbial                  associations may well function as consortia, facilitating:  1)                  exchange of metabolites; 2) regeneration of nutrients; 3)                       localized removal of inhibitory (to N2 fixation and                             photosynthesis) O2 buildups; and 4) detoxification of                           potentially-inhibitory chelators and waste products generated                   within the cyanobacterial phycosphere.                                               This new study will elucidate consortial interactions and                  their potential positive impacts on: 1) cyanobacterial CO2                      fixation, N2 fixation and growth rates; 2) cyanobacterial bloom                 potentials; and 3) the ability of host cyanobacteria to maintain                blooms under nutrient limited conditions.  Recent                               microtechnological (microsensing, immunochemical,                               microautoradiographic) advances and applications have greatly                   facilitated and expanded our ability to address and characterize                these interactions.  Findings will be of value to managers and                  biologists seeking effective mitigative steps for arresting bloom               potentials, including potential use of bacterial and protozoan                  predators/consumers as \"biological control\" agents.",
