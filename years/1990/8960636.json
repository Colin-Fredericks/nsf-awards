 "awd_abstract_narration": "The reproducible crystal growth of thin films with the                     correct stoichiometry and appropriate morphology is the key to                  the commercialization of devices incorporating film high                        temperature superconductors.  Metal oxide chemical vapor                        deposition (MOCVD) has the potential to meet these needs coupled                with relative ease of scaling to manufacturing volumes.  However,               recent work on MOCVD has been plagued by two major limitations:                 (l.) films grown at temperatures less than 800C are amorphous                   mixtures of oxides, fluorides and/or barium carbonate and (2.)                  as-deposited films exhibit cauliflower-like morphology which is                 indicative of low surface mobility growth.  Surface mobilities                  can be increased without elevating the temperature of the                       substrate through the use of a plasma.  Moreover, plasma assisted               laser ablation, sputtering and reactive evaporation have already                been used for the in-situ growth of superconducting thin films at               temperatures as low as 400C, even when BaF2 has been used as the                Ba precursor.  These results suggest that plasma enhanced                       chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) may effect the in-situ growth                 of superconducting thin films with the existing reagent                         technology.  The goal of this first phase of research is to                     demonstrate the PECVD of in-situ superconducting thin films of                  YBaCuO at substrate temperatures below 600 C.",
