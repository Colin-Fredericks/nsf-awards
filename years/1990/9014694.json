 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award will support an anthropology                   graduate student in the Indian Himalayas to study the socio-                    economic implications of male out-migration on indigenous gender                perceptions.  Women in the local society often manage domestic as               well as agricultural work since their husbands are away.                        Traditional views on the sexual division of labor will be                       analyzed.  Methods used include structured and informal                         interviews, censuses, cognitive analyses and time allocation                    studies in a context of an extensive period of participant                      observation.                                                                                                                                                    This research is important because male labor migration occurs in               most regions of the world, and understanding how the absence of                 males affects the behavior and understanding of women's places in               society can help us understand how to stimulate economic                        development in the local areas.",
