 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a study to identify and                 analyse obstacles to international cooperation in controlling                   growth in emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the gases                   contributing to increased warming of the earth's surface.  The                  research will also explore possible means of overcoming these                   obstacles.  The study has five parts:  (1) assembling basic                     information and providing a broad perspective on the prevailing and             prospective CO2 problem, (2) reviewing actual or prospective                    international agreements for insights applicable to the formation               of an international CO2 accord, (3) identifying different                       perspectives, by reviewing relevant policy plans and pronouncements             of governments and private decision makers and by assessing actual              behavior with respect to greenhouse warming in different regions                of the world, (4) reviewing the comparative cost of achieving                   specified reductions in emissions and developing an approximate                 rank-ordering of reduction costs in different regions, and (5)                  exploring and analysing a wide range of equity problems associated              with assumptions and choices about how to control these emissions.              Research findings will be published in a peer-reviewed volume;                  shorter papers will be distributed to scholars and general                      audiences; meetings and briefings will involve both public                      officials and private participants in discussion the implications               of the findings.                                                                                                                                                This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigators are excellent; institutional              support is very good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is                highly recommended.",
