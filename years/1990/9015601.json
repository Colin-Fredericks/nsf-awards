 "awd_abstract_narration": "A 1986 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the National                   Science Foundation (NSF) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects             Agency (DARPA) established a three-year joint program supporting                VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration fabrication by MOSIS (Metal                  Oxide Semiconductor Implementation Service) for qualifying                      universities.  This is a three-year continuation to that agreement,             commencing October 1, 1989.                                                                                                                                     This continuation of the MOU expands the original program to                    accelerate critical capabilities for Microsystems Design and                    Prototyping in U.S. universities.  This includes expanding the                  original services and technologies available  to universities                   authorized to use MOSIS as they become generally available (e.g.                semi-custom and gallium arsenide chip fabrication); stressing VLSI              education, especially undergraduate education needed for designing              future electronic systems; exploring new fabrication services                   designed specifically for the research and education community's                desire for cost effective experimentation of state-of-the-art                   technologies (e.g. design of advanced sensor and micromechanical                devices); and rapid prototyping methodologies, tools and services               needed for complete systems.                                                                                                                                    The program has been widely acclaimed by both universities and                  industry as essential to the U.S. research and education effort,                and important in the national effort to improve U.S.                            competitiveness.  As of June 1, 1990, over one hundred forty (140)              universities are authorized to use MOSIS for VLSI educational                   purposes and over 5500 students are enrolled in university VLSI                 Design classes.  This has provided a valuable cost effective                    educational tool for teaching VLSI, as well as resulted in a sound              human resource base that has significantly contributed to important             research successes supported by both the NSF and DoD.",
