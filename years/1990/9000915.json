Culver, Department of Geological Sciences, Old Dominion                         University, and Dr. Ramzy Khatib, Department of Geology,                        University of Dakar, Senegal, to enhance, for a period of                       24 months, their cooperation, presently supported in part                       under NSF Grant No. EAR-8816137, on early Cambrian small                        shelly fossils, stratigraphy, and paleoenvironments in the                      southwest Taoudeni Basin, West Africa.  The paleontologic                       goal of extensive sample collecting was realized but the                        other goal of that project, the determination of                                paleoenvironments, was only partially achieved.  The                            present project will provide support for additional field                       work by the collaborators and travel by Dr. Khatib to Old                       Dominion University (1) to undertake x-ray diffraction and                      radiographic analyses of samples and (2) to collaborate on                      results and interpretations.                                                                                                                                    The project will add to our knowledge of the stratigraphy                       of the Paleozoic basins and fold belts in West Africa.  It                      will refine our understanding of the distribution of                            earliest Cambrian schemes.  The project also will result in                     interpretations of the environments in which these                              organisms lived, died, and accumulated as fossils.  This                        project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in                         Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                        level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers                      and their counterparts in developing countries through the                      exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.",
