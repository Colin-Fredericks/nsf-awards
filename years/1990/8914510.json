 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peatlands are large accumulations of the partially                         decomposed litter of the bog moss Sphagnum.  These wetlands                     ecosystems cover about 400 million ha and represent a significant               carbon reserve.  Previously waterlogging has been implicated as                 the primary cause for the slow decay.  However, most decay takes                place while the peat is still aerated and therefore waterlogging                is no longer a valid explanation for the slow decay in these                    ecosystems.  Intrinsic properties of the Sphagnum litter have                   been virtually overlooked but could be a critical factor in the                 regulation of decay.  This study will address the issue of decay                limitation by intrinsic qualities of Sphagnum litter versus                     environmental constraints of the raised bog habitat?  This                      research will attempt to decouple these factors by employing                    reciprocal litterbag transplants of Sphagnum mosses complemented                with laboratory respirometer studies.  By identifying the                       ratelimiting factor, these results could have predictive value                  for determining the effects of widespread environmental changes,                e.g., increased nutrients, global warming, on decomposition in                  peat bogs.  Furthermore, the results will have relevance for many               raised bogs because the moss species used in this study occur                   throughout the northern hemisphere.",
