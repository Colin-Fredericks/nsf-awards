 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on understanding the significance and                     role of biotin enzymes in plant metabolism.  To achieve this                    goal the unique somatic embryogenesis system of carrot has                      been utilized to study these proteins.  During the                              development of somatic embryos of carrot the steady state                       levels of one of the six biotin-containing polypeptides                         increases dramatically.  This biotin protein has been                           purified and polyclonal antibodies against it have been                         prepared.  Using these antibodies a cDNA clone coding for                       this biotin protein has been isolated.  This novel biotin                       protein is being investigated through the utilization of                        these antibodies and the cDNA clone as specific probes to                       investigate this novel biotin protein.  These investigations                    concentrate on elucidating the function and regulation of                       this biotin enzyme.  Initial experiments with the antibodies                    have identified this biotin protein as representing an acetyl                   CoA carboxylase.  The function of this form of acetyl-CoA                       carboxylase in plant metabolism is being elucidated by 1)                       identifying the subcellular and tissue distribution of this                     protein in the carrot plant and 2) elucidating the molecular                    genetic mechanisms that regulate the accumulation of this                       protein in response to developmental and environmental                          signals.                                                                                                                                                        Biotin is an essential component of a set of enzymes that                       have important metabolic functions.  The structure, function                    and regulation of a number of biotin enzymes is extensively                     studied in a diverse set of organisms.  However, very little                    is known about the biotin enzymes of plants.  This research                     investigates the function and regulation of plant biotin-                       containing enzymes in order to provide a better understanding                   of their role in plant metabolism.***//",
