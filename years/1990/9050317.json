 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, entitled Watershed Worlds:Global                       Views/Regional Perspectives, uses the study of a watershed as a                 way to look at the global environment. Using science and                        mathematics as information gathering tools, teachers and                        students in several watersheds throughout the country will be                   investigating the human impact on their regional environment.                   The program uses hands-on experiments utilizing state of-the-art                computer, scientific instrumentation and multimedia                             technologies. This project is sponsored by the Thames Science                   Center in New London, Connecticut where staff scientists,                       engineers and computer specialists will work with elementary,                   middle and high school teachers from throughout the country in a                five week summer workshop each year involving 15 teachers. The                  project will be developed and disseminated over the three year                  period and will involve 495 teachers and their students in grade                6-10 at 65 pilot sites throughout the nation. By the third year                 of the project more that 1500 teachers will have been involved.                 The first section of the Watershed Worlds' curriculum, Earth,                   Air and Water, examines chemical and physical phenomena                         including empirical studies on the relationships between air                    movements, precipitation volume and water chemistry. The three                  subsequent sections, In the Current, Still Waters and Changing                  Tides, focus on the applications of this knowledge through the                  study of specific habitats within a watershed. These sections                   cover identification, distribution and physiology of flora and                  fauna in these regions and show how they are influenced by the                  physical and chemical environment. The curriculum is enhanced by                investigatory kits which include sampling equipment supported by                a data base and a multimedia program which help to analyze the                  water quality and biodiversity of the watershed. The National                   Science Foundation is supporting the project in the amount of                   $615,736 which is being matched by $39,824 or about a 6% match.",
