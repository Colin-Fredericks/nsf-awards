 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensory transduction is the process by which the physical energy                of a stimulus, such as light, sound, or chemical binding, is                    converted by a biological receptor cell to a signal that affects                the behavior of that cell.  The process is a fundamental one for                communication between cells in many systems, notably as the input               of information to nervous systems.  Several unicellular organisms               also utilize sensory transduction to orient toward light, or a                  food source, or neighboring cells.  The access of their systems                 to biochemical and genetic manipulation has made them useful to                 study, not only as models for \"higher\" organisms, but in their                  own right, to clarify the mechanisms underlying sensory                         transduction.  This Gordon Conference is one of a continuing                    biennial series since 1976 on this topic, and provides an format                that allows intense discussion among investigators in this highly               multidisciplinary field.  The impact of this conference will be                 on physiologists, neuroscientists, biochemists, and molecular                   biologists who are interested in the currently exciting topic  of               ellular communication.",
