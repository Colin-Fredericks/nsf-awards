 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Alan J. Kohn,                        Department of Zoology, University of Washington, and Dr.                        Ingela Arua, Department of Geology, University of Nigeria,                      to pursue, for a period of 24 months, a program of                              cooperative research on patterns of predation and taxonomic                     diversification in Cenozoic gastropod assemblages.  The                         research will address the question: How did the complex                         communities in which Conidae are so prominent develop in                        time?  The collaborators will utilize material collected by                     the PI under prior NSF grants from assemblages ranging in                       age from latest Miocene to latest Pleistocene in the Ryukyu                     and Fiji Islands.  Their methods will include (1)                               multivariate analysis of morphometric and other shell                           characters and (2) species determination by reference to                        the analysis of type specimens and discriminating                               within-species variation from between-species differences.                                                                                                      This project focuses on one of the largest families of                          marine gastropod molluscs, the Conidae.  This family of                         mainly tropical marine snails is important because of its                       very high diversity, the broad geographic range of many of                      its species, its ecological role as a dominant predatory                        group, primarily in the shallow tropical seas of the                            Indo-West Pacific region, and its unusual danger to man.                        Its neurotoxic venom, normally used to overpower prey, can                      be fatal to man.  This project adds an international                            cooperative dimension to Dr. Kohn's research supported                          under NSF Grant No. BSR-8700523.  Dr. Arua's expertise                          gained during her studies of gastropod predation patterns                       in the Eocene of Nigeria will greatly benefit the project.                      This project is relevant to the objectives of the Science                       in Developing Countries Program which seeks to increase the                     level of cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers                      and their counterparts in developing countries through the                      exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.",
