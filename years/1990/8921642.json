 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the uncertainty about the effects of nutrient                      loading on phytoplankton composition stems from our inadequate                  understanding of how nuisance bloom-formers such as cyanobacteria               succeed in dominating plankton assemblages.  In enriched lakes,                 cyanobacteria appear to migrate from bottom and deepwater                       habitats to occupy the upper layers of the open water, and as                   nutrient conditions permit, cyanobacteria extend their use of the               photic zone until, by growth and migration, they monopolize                     lights in the heterogeneous environments of stratified lakes as                 effectively as they do in the homogeneous environments of                       shallow, mixed lakes.                                                                This research is a coordinated lake (mesocosm and whole-                   lake) and laboratory (cyclostat) set of experiments to obtain a                 better understanding of the ecological significance of surface                  blooms and their consequences at consumer as well as producer                   levels.  Our objectives are (1) to determine the significance of                the oxidation state nitrogen and (2) the relative availability of               carbon nitrogen and phosphorus to cyanobacterial buoyancy                       regulation and bloom formation, (3) to evaluate the effects of C-               N-P interactions on dominance of the photic zone and the                        phytoplankton by cyanobacteria and (4) to evaluate the effects of               different degrees of cyanobacterial success on trophic-level                    interactions.  The project will contribute to basic limnology,                  while providing valuable information which will add to the                      knowledge base used in lake management.",
