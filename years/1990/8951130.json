 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Five College Astronomy Department will obtain 5 processing                  workstations for use by undergraduate students.  The workstations will          be used: (1) to develop laboratory exercises related to course work at          the introductory and advanced levels; and (2) to enhance the research           opportunities available to undergraduates in the department.  Image             processing was largely pioneered in astronomy, and it is now applied to         a wide range of scientific and technical disciplines including geology,         atmospheric science and medicine.  Through the introduction of this             hardware into astronomy lab courses, astronomy majors will be introduced        to scientific analysis tools which have become as fundamental to                astronomical research as the telescope, and the quality of laboratory           exercises that they do will be substantially improved since they will           involve processing of digital data obtained at the world's most powerful        telescopes using state of the art instruments.  For non-majors in our           courses, the introduction of astronomical image processing provides a           means to teach this basic scientific analysis tool in an exciting               scientific context.  Finally, the availability of image processing              facilities to undergraduates will substantially improve their access to         research opportunities within the department and improve the quality of         the independent study and senior honors programs.",
