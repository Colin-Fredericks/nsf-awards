 "awd_abstract_narration": "While many arthropod.fungus mutualisms are known, no                    comparable vertebrate.fungus systems have been documented.  Based               on similarities to arthropod.fungal mutualists, banner.tailed                   kangaroo rats, \u001aDipodomys\u001a \u001aspectabilis\u001a, are good candidates to be             fungal mutualists.  In laboratory trials \u001aD\u001a. \u001aspectabilis\u001a consumes            moldy seeds and manipulates seeds to influence seed water content               and moldiness.  Under natural conditions, up to 30 species of                   fungi, including many important toxigenic genera, were recovered                from cached seeds in \u001aD\u001a. \u001aspectabilis\u001a mounds and cheekpouches                 sampled near Portal, Cochise Co., Arizona.  Many of these molds                 are economically important causes of seed deterioration in human                grain storage systems, yet relatively little is known about their               ecology in non.human systems.  At least some molds associated                   with \u001aD\u001a. \u001aspectabilis\u001a are unique; five new varieties of                       \u001aPenicillium\u001a which produce antibiotics, but not mycotoxins, are                known only from these caches and cheekpouches.  This research                   will investigate the identity and variability of molds associated               with \u001aD\u001a. \u001aspectabilis\u001a compared to molds associated with soil and              with seeds of food plants.  The impact of molds  on the                         nutritional composition of seeds will be assayed.  Field choice                 trials will be conducted to determine the relative attractiveness               of non.moldy and moldy seeds to foraging \u001aD\u001a. \u001aspectabilis.\u001a",
