 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project combines investigations into                          mathematical questions of classical complex analysis with                       applications to control problems and finitely generated algebras                of functions of several complex variables.                                           The optimal control problems, arising in engineering, are                  phrased in terms of vector-valued, bounded, functions defined on                certain cylinder-like sets.  One is interested in minimizing a                  certain functional over the class of functions.  Sometimes there                are no extermal functions, other times they turn out to be                      analytic.  Sometimes there are unique solutions, but not always.                The goal of this work is to describe the cylinders which give                   rise to bounded analytic optimal functions which are smooth on                  the boundary of the cylinder.  A number of positive results in                  this area have focused the problem to one of taking analytic                    selections of functions on sets fibered over the unit circle and                determining when such functions agree with a given function when                restricted to the unit interval.                                                     Work on algebra generators evolves from an earlier result of               Gleason which suggests that the classes of continuous and                       holomorphic functions in the two-dimensional domains which vanish               at the origin are finitely generated algebras.  This is easy to                 do for the bidisc, although the minimum norm of the generators is               not yet known (it is probably unity).  This particular question                 is to be addressed by computational methods first to verify the                 conjectured minimum.  For the general Gleason problem, a new                    approach will be made by converting it to an equivalent problem                 in first order partial differential equations.  Estimates for the               norm of the generators should follow if this plan works out.",
