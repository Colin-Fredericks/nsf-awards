 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the                                   photocatalytic oxidation of several representative organic                      contaminants of water as they are affected by altering the                      properties of the catalyst used in this process.  The                           catalyst selected for this research project is titanium                         dioxide.  The catalytic properties of this substance will                       be altered by subjecting it to various physical and                             chemical processes that alter its surface characteristics.                                                                                                      The proposal leading to this award was submitted under                          conditions in the NSF Program Announcement titled:                              \"Research Initiation Awards,\" NSF 88-99.  The project                           addresses the problem of removing relatively small                              concentrations of organic pollutants from aqueous                               solution.  The ultimate goal is a process for                                   decontamination of water and removal of organics from                           wastewater that utilizes solar energy to drive the                              oxidation process.  Results of this project may be applied                      in engineering design of water and wastewater treatment                         processes and systems.",
