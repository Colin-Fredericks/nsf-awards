 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of the FT-IR spectrophotometer allowed the                      introduction and development of microscale laboratory experiments               at all levels of the chemistry curriculum.  Continued conversion                to and an increase in the variability of microscale experiments                 occurred in the organic laboratory sequence.  The instrumentation               strengthened the development of the organic laboratory projects                 which have greatly stimulated the students' interests in chemical               and biological research.  New experiments were introduced and                   modified for the physical and integrated laboratories.  The                     interest in polymers and surface analysis was further stimulated                by observing spectral properties of materials using the FT-IR                   reflectance accessory.  Greater student-faculty interaction in                  the area of research (polymer films, molybdenum complexes,                      products resulting from mechanistic studies) were fostered by the               acquisition of the FT-IR spectrophotometer.  Construction and use               of the spectral libraries gave the students opportunities to gain               skills in chemical analysis used in the environmental analysis                  sector.                                                                                                                                                         The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
