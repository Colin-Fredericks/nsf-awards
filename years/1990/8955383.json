The report is based on a        study conducted by the Urban Institute of twenty-four existing                  partnerships across the United States which are serving to improve              science and mathematics education.  The project plan is to disseminate          the report to approximately one thousand (1000) schools and one hundred         (100) businesses.  In addition, wide spread publicity on the                    availability of the report is to be made within the corporate sector.           There is to be no cost sharing in this project.",
