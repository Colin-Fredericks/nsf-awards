 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduates at Curry College can become more  involved in                    research through the purchase of equipment that allows                          integration of the IBM-compatible PC's with the existing                        scientific instrumentation system. The new instrumentation                      upgrades the existing system, and extends the speed, range, and                 versatility of measurements that can be made. This improvement                  allows students to perform sophisticated scientific experiments                 under computer control and to gain experience with sophisticated                statistical analysis programs. Students, many of whom have                      learning disabilities, are becoming involved in research on the                 psychophysiology of brain function and the psychophysiology of                  stress. Students in Experimental Psychology are becoming involved               in semester-long projects that enrich their understanding of                    scientific research and improve the quality of their preparation                for advanced studies in psychology. The college will contribute                 an amount equal to the award.",
