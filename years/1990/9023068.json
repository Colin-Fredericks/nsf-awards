 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Web Handling Research Center at Oklahoma State University              has been a very viable and successful I/UCRC since 1985.  The                   Center's research concentrates on \"Webs\", which are materials that              are manufactured and processed in continuous flexible, strip form,              and includes paper, plastics, textiles, metals, and composites.                 Web technology is used in almost every continuous process industry              in some way.  The Center's research efforts are in the areas of:                1) longitudinal dynamics; 2) lateral dynamics; 3) winding and                   unwinding; 4) wrinkling; 5) measurement of physical properties, and             6) control strategies.                                                               The Center has grown to 15 corporate sponsors, and has                     received a grant of $900,000 over six years from the Noble                      Foundation for equipment and graduate fellowship support.  The                  Center has used its Industrial Advisory Board very effectively over             its lifetime to help define and direct its research, and recently               began to concentrate efforts on technology transfer.  These efforts             have included seminars in sponsors' plants and a live interactive               satellite-delivered teleconference delivered to the Center                      sponsors.  The Center is clearly an effective I/UCRC Center and                 meets all the requirements for the program.  The Program Manager                recommends that Oklahoma State University be awarded $33,000 for                the first year of a three-year, Self-Sufficient Partnership for                 Research, $8,000 for the support of an evaluator in the Center for              one year, and $10,000 for the support of two female undergraduate               students under the \"Funding for Support for Woman, Minority, and                Disabled Engineering Research Assistants, for a total of $51,000.                    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or the Division Director of the Engineering Centers Division                will review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                 including the following:  1) extent to which University/Industry                interaction and collaboration is developing; 2) extent to which the             support base for the Center is expanding; 3) extent to which robust             research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the             Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this               continuing grant.",
