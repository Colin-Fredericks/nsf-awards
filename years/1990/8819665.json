Valentine, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Clarkson                       University, to pursue with Dr. Jae Min Hyun, Department of                      Mechanical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science                     and Technology (KAIST) for a period of 24 months, a program                     of cooperative research on the effects of rotation on                           density stratified flows: basic flow problems in                                cylindrical geometries.  The collaborators will investigate                     the time-dependent motions of liquids confined within                           cylindrical tanks that are induced by imposed thermal                           gradients and rotational speed changes at the walls of                          these containers.  The principal goal of this research is                       to further the understanding of the dynamics of rotating                        flows of density stratified fluids.  The following three                        computational problems will be addressed, namely,                               predicting (1) the effect of the \"bathtub\" or drain vortex                      on the draining of density stratified fluid from a                              cylindrical tank, (2) the three-dimensional vortex                              interactions that aid in the spin-up of a stratified fluid                      in a rotating cylindrical container initially at rest, and                      (3) the phenomena associated with the mixing of a                               stratified fluid in a cylindrical container by a centrally                      located rotating disk.                                                                                                                                          The PI will extend his 4th-order computational algorithm to                     handle flows with rotation and stratification.  The Korean                      collaborator will conduct a series of experiments that will                     include the configurations of the three problems posed.  He                     also will apply his computational method to some of the                         cases computed in the U.S. to establish more strongly the                       validity of the predictions.  The problems to be addressed                      are of technological importance in thermal energy storage                       tanks, flow-through reservoirs, and mixing devices designed                     to mix miscible fluids of different densities.  The                             collaborators have considerable experience in the field of                      this research.  The solution to the problems addressed by                       this project would be beneficial to the United States and                       Korea.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                       U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                           increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean                       scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  Korean                            participation is supported by the Korea Science and                             Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).",
