The Institute is designed                   to foster changes in teachers' attitudes (toward minorities,                    role of teachers, organization of classrooms), and empower the                  teachers to develop the skills necessary to put those attitudes                 into practice.  The three areas in which teachers will work                     are:  1) developing greater understanding of the strengths and                  needs of minority students; and investigating the applicability                 of 2) the cooperative learning approach and 3) the problem                      solving approach to enrichment of multicultural science                         classrooms.  Throughout the Institute, teachers will themselves                 learn in the cooperative learning/problem solving mode, with                    continuing attention to the needs of minority students.  Their                  major task will be to develop new instructional units for                       teaching their science classes the following year utilizing                     those modes.  Followup will include three days at the end of                    the summer, four formal all-day sessions during the school                      year, and school visits by Institute staff.",
