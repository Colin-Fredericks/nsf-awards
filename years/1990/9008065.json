Specific elements of our                                                        investigation are: (1) Evaluate the                                             growth of new semiconductor                                                     structures by sequentially layering                                             atomic monolayers. This could                                                   become a totally new type of                                                    chemistry. Technologically                                                      important materials such as InGaAs2                                             and GaA13As4 would not have alloy-                                              related problems like carrier                                                   scattering and energy level                                                     broadening. (2) Growth studies of                                               ordered magnetic II-VI                                                          semiconductors. Large enhancements                                              of the magnetic susceptibility are                                              expected for Cd3MnTe4, which appear                                             to be necessary for devices like                                                magnetically-tunable lasers and                                                 Faraday rotators. (3) Evaluate the                                              laser-ablation technique for p- and                                             n-doping of II-VI semiconductors.                                               p-n junctions are just beginning to                                             become feasible for CdTe and                                                    possible ZnSe.  (4) Overlaying thin                                             films of magnetic metals may lead                                               to higher density magnetic                                                      recording.  (5) Epitaxial growth                                                and thin film layering of high-Tc                                               superconductors. In situ deposition                                             of insulating barriers could lead                                               to improve tunnel junctions.",
