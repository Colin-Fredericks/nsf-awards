 "awd_abstract_narration": "Correlative evidence suggests that synaptonemal complexes (SCs) and         recombination nodules (RNs) are involved in chromosome synapsis and             genetic recombination. However, little is known about the constituents          of SCs and RNS that might help elucidate their precise funtion(s).              It is proposed to isolate SCs and RNs from the plant species Lilium             longiflorum and to characterize the proteins from isolated SCs/RNs by           gel electrophoresis.  Isolated SCs/RNs will also be injected into mice          to elicit antibodies.  Hybridomas will be made and screened against             isolated SCs/RNs by immunofluorescence.  The monoclonal antibodies              identified will then be used (1) to identify SC/RN proteins in Western          blots, (2) to examine developmental and tissue-specific expression of           the SC/RN proteins, (3) to determine the cross-reactivity of the                antibodies to other plant and animal SCs and RNs, and (4) to determine          the relationship between nodules observed during four of the substages          of meiotic prophase I (leptotene, zygotene, pachytene, and diplotene).          These antibodies later can be used for affinity chromatography and/or           immunoprecipitation to isolate SC/RN proteins in large quantities to            determine their functions and to identify the genes coding for them.                                                                                            This work has the potential to lead to a real break-through in our              understanding of the function(s) of SCs and RNs.",
