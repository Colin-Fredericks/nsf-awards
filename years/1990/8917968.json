 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by seven U.S.                 scientists in an Indo-U.S. workshop on underground space                        technology to be held in New Delhi, India in March 1991.  The                   Indian counterpart is Dr. B. Singh, Director, Central Mining                    Research Station in Dhanbad, India.  The three-and-half days                    workshop will cover the following areas:  planning and design of                underground space for various purposes; methods of construction                 including rapid tunnelling; underground excavation and much                     transportation; monitoring of behavior during construction and                  thereafter, ventilation, drainage, lighting and worker's safety;                site evaluation and geotechnical design, and prediction of                      geomining conditions and excavation problems.  In addition to                   evolving technology for the Indian conditions, the workshop will                identify areas where U.S.-Indian collaboration would be useful.                                                                                                 Scope:  This field is in an area of increasing importance due to                the increazsed need for maximum utilization of space and in                     economy in heating and cooling in addtion to the other conditions               requiring underground construction such as tunnels, mines, and                  safety shelters.  The topic is timely for India and for the U.S.                It is likely that the exchange of information by U.S. and Indian                scientists will benefit both sides from the experiences gained                  heretofore, and that avenues for cooperation on areas that need                 research will be identified.  Workshop report will be published                 and distributed to the U.S. community and in India.",
