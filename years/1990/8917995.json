 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central problem in interpreting atmospheric chemistry has                been finding a rational means of evaluating the relative roles of               chemistry and transport, so that the budgets, reaction times,                   fluxes, etc. of primary interest could be identified and                        quantified.  One approach to this problem has been to use                       measurements of the atmospheric concentrations of natural and                   manmade radionuclides as a way of evaluating transport.  The                    atmospheric concentrations of radionuclides such as Radon-222 and               Krypton-85 are essentially insensitive to chemical effects, while               at the same time are affected by transport in the same way as are               many of the chemically reactive species found in the atmosphere.                Thus the simultaneous measurement of both radioactive and                       reactive chemical species has proved to be an effective approach                in atmospheric chemistry field experiments.                                          The objectives of this research project is to: 1) build and                flight test an airborne radon pumped whole air sampler, and build               the laboratory transfer/analysis system for use in conjunction                  with the whole air sampler; and 2) build an airborne aerosol                    sampling system designed to collect samples for Pb-210 analysis.                Both samplers will be designed to facilitate their eventual                     integration aboard medium sized research aircraft such as the                   NCAR Electra.  This equipment will be available and for use in                  organized multi-investigator atmospheric chemistry experiments                  such as the Pacific Stratus/Sulfur Investigation (PSI), the                     Pacific Dust Experiment (PACDEX) or the Atmosphere/Ocean                        Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE).",
