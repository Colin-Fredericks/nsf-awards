 "awd_abstract_narration": "A widely tunable and compact IR laser source emitting in the               9-12 um range based on very efficient phase modulation of CO 2                  lasers at microwave frequencies will be constructed and                         characterized.  This laser source consists of a line selecting CO               2 laser, which is stabilized to the 4.3 um emission Lamb-dip, and               a traveling-wave CdTe buffered BaAs microstrip electrooptic                     modulator.  With a 20 W microwave drive power, it can provide a                 continuously tunable IR power output of 10 to 50 mW at                          frequencies 8 to 18 GHz off-set from the laser carrier frequency.               The performance and usefulness of this source will be evaluated                 and demonstrated by carrying out both direct saturation                         absorption and hererodyne measurements.  The saturation                         absorption measurements can provide individual line profiles of                 atomic and molecular transitioons with sub-Doppler resolution.                  This tunable laser will also be used as a local oscillator in a                 heterodyne spectrometer which can provide a significant                         improvement in system sensitivity.  An ultra-high resolution and                extremely low noise IR heterodyne spectrometer is required for                  the study of interesting phenomena in the atmospheres of planets                occurring in low density, low temperature regions, where sub-                   Doppler spectral resolution are needed to resolve fully the line                shapes and to map spatially the source.  The information                        retrievable from IR heterodyne measurements can accurately                      determine pressure, temperature, excitation, and molecular                      abundances of planetary atmospheres.                                                                                                                                 The same technology will find applications in remote sensing               measurements of trace gases in the earth's atmosphere.//",
