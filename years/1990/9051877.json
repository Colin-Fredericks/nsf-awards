 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemistry department has devoted considerable effort during                 the past eight years to curriculum development and the                          preparation of instructional materials, based on their premise                  that a chemistry curriculum should: (1) be designed for specific                students which it serves; (2) serve majors and non-majors equally               well; (3) provide maximum flexibility; (4) reflect current                      practice in chemistry and chemical education at all levels in the               curriculum, both in the classroom and the laboratory.  Current                  laboratory practice implies the intorduction of students to                     modern instrumentation, an area in which the department has made                significant gains in the last five years, due in part to a CSIP                 grant from NSF.  They planned to offer a new course for both                    science and non-science majors.  The faculty structured a                       laboratory experience that involves some of the senior majors                   working with the non-majors in a cooperative environmental study                project.  The institution sees this grouping of students as a                   microcosm of our society, i.e., a few scientifically aware                      persons working with a larger number of persons having marginal                 scientific literacy.  Through the project, the department                       acquired a gas chromatographic system capable of analyzing for                  volatile organic compounds, including halogenated compounds.                    This instrument along with atomic absorption, dc-plasma, and                    anode stripping instruments allows the students to seek answers                 to analytical problems involving both inorganic and organic                     contaminants in the ground water.                                                                                                                               The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF award.",
