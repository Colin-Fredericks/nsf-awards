 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will be concerned principally with the analysis of               classes of second order partial differential equations or partial               integrodifferential equations describing time-dependent                         phenomena.  In certain cases, good approximations to the                        solutions can be obtained by discarding the highest order time                  derivative in the equation.  Work will be done in justifying such               approximations by considering the effects of sending the highest                time derivative to zero.  For the short time behavior, one                      obtains a singular perturbation problem in which transient                      phenomena governed by a related equation should occur on a fast                 time scale.  For the long time behavior, regular dependence of                  the time-asymptotic limit or - in cases of severe non-uniqueness                of stationary states - selection effects from the transient                     behavior are expected.  In this project, efforts will be made to                place some of these heuristic conjectures on a mathematically                   sound basis.  Work will also be done on questions of existence of               solutions for the reduced problems.                                                  Sources for the equations under study include mathematical                 models describing shear flows for viscoelastic materials and                    polymerrheology.",
