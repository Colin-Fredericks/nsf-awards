 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research focusing on                   complex analytic methods applied to the analysis of convolution                 equations, integral geometry and systems of algebraic                           equations.  Earlier work on interpolation problems in spaces of                 entire functions has led naturally to questions concerning                      multidimensional convolutions equations.  One is actually                       interested in the question of deconvolution.  Many physical                     realizable systems such as transducers and sensors can be                       modeled as convolution with distributions.  This gives rise to                  a scheme to estimate signals such as images, radiation,                         acoustics, etc.  The data are given as a convolution plus noise                 and the reconstruction process in this project consists of                      finding systematic ways of constructing deconvolvers.  In                       pursuing this work, several mathematical problems arise which                   are treated as distinct objectives.  They include finding the                   degrees and height in the algebraic Bezout equation, obtaining                  new properties and representations of residue currents                          (multidimensional residues) and questions in integral geometry                  related to the Pompieu problem.  The Pompieu problem actually                   covers a vast array of questions concerning integrals of a                      fixed function over various congruent configurations.  If the                   integtrals equal zero on a class of congruent sets, one is                      interested in knowing whether or not the function must be zero.                 Most of this work is set within the framework of several                        complex variables.  Techniques of analytic function theory and                  harmonic analysis are predominant.  Diverse applications to                     systems theory and engineering are expected.",
