This is a collaborative project with                                            Professor G. Wayne Clough at Virginia                                           Polytechnic Institute and State University.                                     The Earth Technology Corporation, Long Beach,                                   California, is assisting in obtaining the                                       field data: in addition Drs. Geoffrey Martin                                    and Edward Kavazanjian of Earth Technology                                      Corporation are providing technical                                             assistance to the project.  Drs. Clough,                                        Chameau, and Kavazanjian during the period                                      1979-1985 investigated the soil response and                                    soil failures expected in the Bay Area as a                                     result of a large earthquake: however the                                       effects observed as a result of the Loma                                        Prieta earthquake appear to be more extensive                                   than was expected, in part because the ground                                   motions were more severe than anticipated                                       from data existing ten years ago.  The                                          project is utilizing these previous studies,                                    focusing on the areas that suffered                                             significant ground failures, such as the                                        Marina District.  At the same time it is                                        using the improved understanding of ground                                      failure mechanisms that has occurred since                                      the original studies were undertaken.                                                                                                                           The objectives of this project are: to gather                                   relevant geotechnical data obtained since                                       1980; to map ground features that are                                           important to identify the extent of                                             liquefaction and ground amplification                                           effects; perform about 30 cone penetration                                      tests at locations where earlier tests had                                      been conducted; organize the above                                              information into a computerized data base;                                      and make preliminary assessments of the                                         correlation between field observations and                                      data obtained before and after the 1989                                         earthquake.",
