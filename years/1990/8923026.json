 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional development-related transportation planning starts             from the assumptions that lower rural transport costs will promote              agricultural production and that the surplus produced by agriculture            will encourage the development of domestic industry.  Increases in              national income associated with this kind of development then allow             improvements in education and health.  In contrast to traditional               transportation planning, which is based on economic cost-benefit                analyses, access-based transportation planning focuses on the direct            social impacts of transportation investment on access to educational,           health, and other social facilities.  This doctoral dissertation                improvement award will support research assessing whether                       transportation planning based explicitly on social rather than on               economic criteria will sigificantly improve personal access to social           facilities in rural areas.  The study will focus on Cote d'Ivoire, a            nation with accurate, detailed, and complete records.  Operational              measures of accessibility will be developed and validated and a model           of access planning will be tested to determine how rural access to              services has changed in recent decades and how resources could have             been used to maximize accessibility.                                                                                                                                 The increased understanding of the nature of a theory of                   transportation and development depends on this kind of study, which             will focus on the specific social impacts of spatial and structural             variations in roads and facilities.  By studying the importance of              social aspects of transportation planning, this research will                   contribute to understanding of basic development processes.  This               project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising              young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
