 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fabrication of integrated circuits involves the creation                    of patterned, multilayer, thin film structures composed of                      insulators, semiconductors, and conductors.  Typically, these                   structures are constructed by using photolithographic                           techniques in conjunction with additional processing steps,                     including chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etching, doping,                     etc.  Some of these steps (e.g., wet etching) lack sufficient                   resolution for high density devices, while others (e.g., high                   temperatures in CVD) subject the wafer to extreme conditions                    that may damage underlying structures.  Furthermore,                            patterning of thin films by lithography involves several                        complex processing steps (e.g. spin-on bake, expose, develop,                   etch, photo-resist strip) which increase the chance of                          defects.  This has led researchers in the semiconductor                         industry to investigate laser processing of microelectronic                     devices.  The repair of mask sets by depositing or etching a                    feature and customizing of electronic packages as other                         applications where laser processing is expected to have a                       considerable impact.  Research in laser processing has                          resulted in an array of novel micro-chemical processing                         techniques.  This PI's research program focuses on laser                        induced deposition.  The process of scanning a laser beam                       across a substrate, causing reactants in either the gas,                        liquid or solid phase to react and deposit on the substrate is                  commonly referred to as laser direct-writing.                                                                                                                   This research project is a combined experimental and modelling                  study of the fundamental mechanisms underlying nonlinear                        morphological effects in direct laser writing of metal and                      semiconductor lines from spun-on metalorganic layers as well                    as by CVD.  The experimental system consists of a microscope                    for focusing radiation from an argon laser onto a substrate.                    An x-y translation stage moves the substrate relative to the                    laser beam so that lines may be written.  The nonlinear                         behavior to be investigated includes multiplicity phenomena,                    periodic patterns, and volcano-shaped deposits.  These effects                  are observed over a wide range of operating conditions in a                     large number of applications including the deposition of gold                   from organogold films, silicon from silane, and yttrium-                        barium-copper-oxygen superconductors from spun-on metalorganic                  films.  The overall goals of this coordinated experimental and                  modelling research program are to understand the underlying                     fundamental processes and to develop predictive models that                     may be used to prevent or control the nonlinear behavior.                       This will be critical to the further development of laser                       direct-write systems that will have to face new applications                    and meet increasingly stringent specifications on feature size                  in order to satisfy the needs of future microelectronics and                    micromechanical processing.",
