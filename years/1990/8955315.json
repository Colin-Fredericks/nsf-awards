 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project, starting in May 1990 and sponsored by                    Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology, offers a                     geoscience based four week summer program for middle-school                     teachers in the rural areas of Montana, Idaho, North Dakota,                    Utah and Wyoming.  There will be 20 teachers involved in the                    program the first year and 25 in the second.  The project                       will use the resources of a well established local                              Science/Technology Alliance and the Montana Tech Math/Science                   Resource Center.  The teacher participants will experience                      the cross curriculum nature of science and technology through                   course work and field activities led by professors from the                     Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology and                           representatives of local natural resource based industries                      who are part of the Science/Technology Alliance. Activities                     particularly relevant to rural communities such as water                        quality control, wildlife impact studies, and mining will be                    the basis of the content.  These represent \"real world\"                         issues which will have meaning both to teachers and students.                         Continued year-round content and activity support will                    be provided by the Montana Tech Math/Science Resource Center.                   Teachers will involve their clases in \"real-life\" activities                    of                                                                              science research.  Reports of these activities will be compiled                 and disseminated to all particapating teachers.  The NSF share of               support for the project is $240,730 and is being matched by                     Montana Tech and other local agencies in the amount of $105,277.                The matching funds are approximately 44% of the NSF grant.",
