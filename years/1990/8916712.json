 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunity for Women (ROW) award is a study of                   laminated sediments from the antarctic continental shelf in order to            reconstruct the Holocene (the most recent 2500 years) climatic                  record.  Existing sediment cores from the George V. Basin, a deep               inner continental shelf basin located off the Wilkes Land Coast, will           be sampled in this effort.  These are ideal for high resolution study           because of the detail preserved in the undisturbed and unmixed                  laminated sections, and because of the relatively high (approximately           three millimeters per year) sedimentation rates.  It is hypothesized            that the laminated segments originated because extensive primary                productivity in a necessarily ice-free ocean environment resulted in            high carbon fluxes to the sea floor and the development of anoxic               conditions below the sediment-water interface.  Alternating intervals           of non-laminated (mixed, and probably bio-turbated) sediments record            deposition under a more extensive or persistent sea ice cover.                                                                                                  The measurements obtained from the cores will be used to model the              history of basin deposition in the time interval since the retreat of           the antarctic ice sheet form the continental shelf to its present               position.  Radiocarbon dates will allow the correlation of the                  sediment cores to other high resolution proxy climate data (e.g. from           ice cores), and will serve as a link between the marine and                     terrestrial climate records.  Ultimately it is expected that these              results can be used to predict where similar high resolution proxy              records may be found in other antarctic marginal basins, so that the            analysis may be extended to assess the effects of geologically recent           climatic change on oceanographic and depositional conditions in the             Southern Ocean.",
