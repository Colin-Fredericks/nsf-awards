 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to aid in purchase of equipment                  needed for large scale culture of marine organisms at the                       Columbia campus of the University of South Carolina.  Although                  the University has already developed a strong program in marine                 biology, its researchers depend heavily on facilities at the                    Baruch Institute, which is on the coast at some distance from                   Columbia.  The equipment will permit large scale culture of                     marine microorganisms and the culture and maintenance of marine                 animals.  Key to both units is the installation of a large,                     recirculating seawater system that will use seawater brought from               the coast by truck.  The capacity and flexibility of the proposed               system will permit it to satisfy current and future needs, and                  will permit other faculty, who do not now study marine organisms,               to initiate such studies without major disruption to their                      current research programs.                                                           Experimental studies in marine biology have always struggled               with a basic problem, the need for fresh seawater for the culture               and maintenance of marine animals, plants and microorganisms.                   Although artificial substitutes for seawater now exist, their                   cost  precludes their use on a large scale.  Thus much marine                   biology has been done in specialized oceanside research                         laboratories which                                                              are often at considerable distance from the campuses whose faculty              use them and are often used intensively only during the summer.                 This has tended to isolate marine biologists from other                         biologists, and has hindered the transfer of modern techniques,                 especially those of molecular biology, from other areas of                      biology.  One solution to this problem is to truck large amounts                of seawater to a university which is near, but not on the ocean,                so that marine organisms can be grown \"on site\" is sufficient                   quantity for year round research programs.  This solution also                  facilitates multi-investigator, multidisciplinary research                      programs that involve skilled researchers from non-marine                       disciplines.  Such collaborations will be key to the development                of new approaches to the study of marine organisms, and to the use              of such organisms in biotechnology.",
