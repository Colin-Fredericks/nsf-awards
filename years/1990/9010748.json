 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this accomplishment-based renewal project, Gary Becker will                  continue his research that links the family to investments in                   human capital, bequests and other types of physical capital                     accumulation, economic inequality, and economic growth.                                                                                                         One study will be an expansion of A Treatise on the Family. It                  will include a response to some of the criticisms and discuss                   several additional issues. Particular attention will be paid to                 the so-called \"Rotten-Kid Theorem\", which states that, under                    certain conditions, beneficiaries of altruists have incentives to               behave altruistically to their benefactors, even when                           beneficiaries are selfish. One defect is that the Treatise does                 not interact parental altruism with other attitudes of parents                  towards children. That is, the degree of parental altruism is                   not fixed. The new work will show that such links between the                   behavior of children and the degree if parental altruism help                   overcome various inefficiencies that can result from altruism,                  such as the so-called \"prodigal son\" issue.                                                                                                                     Other work will continue on the relationship between family                     behavior and economic growth by incorporating endogenous                        fertility into a neoclassical growth model. In a related study,                 endogenous fertility is combined with physical capital as well                  investment in human capital. Two states tend to emerge - one with               low human and physical capital, low income, and high fertility -                and another with low fertility and high human and physical                      capital and income. The research will attempt to explain why                    human capital increases relative to physical capital when                       countries grow, why fertility declines when countries get richer                and why luck and other temporary events may have an effect on                   whether a country grows or stagnates.                                                                                                                           Another line of research will be on how the division of labor and               specialization with regard to human capital varies with economic                growth and other variables. Stressed here will be importance of                 coordination costs and the extent of general knowledge (since                   increased accumulation of general knowledge raises the growth                   rate partly by inducing greater specialization).",
