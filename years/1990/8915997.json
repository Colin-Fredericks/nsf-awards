 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a two-year study focused on clarifying the field,               age, spatial, and genetic relationships of strongly contaminated                and reduced I-type \"I-SCR\" granite plutons, sensu stricto, with                 specific pre-batholith wall rocks occurring as roof pendants                    within the Western Sierra Nevada batholith along the south                      eastern projection of the Metamorphic Foothills belt near                       Mariposa, California (Fig. 1).  We will also address the origin                 of gold and tungsten in the Mother Lode gold quartz vein belt                   which occupies the Melones Fault within the Metamorphic Foothills               belt.  The latter ends abruptly near Mariposa where invasion on                 the eastern and southern margins by the Sierra Nevada batholith                 in Jurassic and Cretaceous time position the northern end of the                colinear reduced granite belt on strike with the Mother Lode and                extends from there southwards towards the southern end of the                   Sierra Nevada batholith.                                                             This lithotectonic correlation with magma characteristics                  will be detailed through regional sampling of metamorphic wall                  rocks and plutons followed up with whole rock and mineral                       chemistry to better explain the distribution of reduced I-SCR                   granites which we have hypothesized to have form either by their                derivation through partial melting of hydrous graphitic pelites                 or assimilation of these wallrocks by ordinary I-type magmas.  To               accomplish this we will perform graphite furnace atomic                         absorption (AAS) and ICP mass spectrometry trace element analysis               of selected metals (Au, W, Sn, Mo, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn,               Zr, Nb, C, S and Ag).  it is impossible to resolve source rock                  problems without using isotopic tracers as trace element data                   alone are insufficient.  Therefore two isotope studies will be                  conducted.  First, in collaboration with Jason Saleeby of Cal.                  Tech, we propose to perform lead isotope analysis on University                 of California Geology Museum galena specimens from several Mother               Lode deposit along the Melones Fault zone to the immediate north                west of Mariposa and to compare these with whole-rock lead                      isotope ratios of nearby metamorphic wallrocks, including Shoo                  Fly, Calaveras, Mariposa, Don Pedro hypabyssal rocks and each of                the pluton types we have identified near Mariposa including I-                  SCR, as well as I-WC, MC, and SC.  This study will be directed at               inferring the nature of wall rocks traversed by hydrothermal                    fluids coursing through the vein flow path.  Secondly, in                       collaboration with Don DePaolo at Berkeley, we propose to use Rb-               Sr and Nd-Sm isotopes to confirm conclusions made from Pb                       systematics on magmatic source rocks and to establish the extent                and reductive efficacy of metamorphic wall rock assimilation on                 magma properties.                                                                    Using the empirical igneous amphibole aluminum geobarometer                of Hammarstrom and Zen (1986) to expand on our earlier                          conclusions about the regional depth of crystallization within                  the batholiths, we will place magma-wallrock interaction effects                and hydrothermal gold quartz veins in a more quantitative                       geobarometric framework focussing on potential source rocks and                 selective release mechanisms of ore metals, particularly Au, Ag,                Pb, W, Sn.  However, since I-SCR plutons rarely contain                         amphiboles, only pluton types other than I-SCR which do contain                 amphibole, are of similar age to the veins, and have appropriate                bulk compositions for application of the geobarometer are                       suitable for this purpose.",
