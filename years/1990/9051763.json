 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of equipment to conduct seismic surveying and the               computing equipment to archive, refine, and interpret geophysical data          are significantly improving undergraduate laboratory experiences in             geophysics courses. Using a sledge hammer as an energy source, the              seismograph records the arrival of seismic waves that have been                 reflected and refracted by rock layers. The laptop computer archives            the raw data collected in the field and transfers this data to the more         powerful desktop computer. Undergraduates manipulate the data, which            provide important information on subsurface geologic structure. Apart           from heavy use in geophysics courses, the equipment is used for                 demonstration and laboratory exercises in both upper and lower                  division courses. Additionally the seismograph and computing equipment          are used extensively by undergraduates for research projects for                independent studies or senior theses. The research projects consist             largely of multi-disciplinary studies of pre-Cambrian rocks in                  Michigan's western upper peninsula; because of the paucity of rock              expsure in this area and highly irregular bedrock topography beneath            glacial drift, seismic and other geophysical techniques are employed.           The university is contributing an amount equal to 151% of the award.",
