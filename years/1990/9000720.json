 "awd_abstract_narration": "An REU site is established to address the problem of inspiring                  undergraduate chemical engineering students to pursue careers in                research.  Junior-level chemical engineering students from various              schools throughout the U.S. and its possessions will be invited to the          site to work in relevant areas of research within chemical                      engineering.  The focus of the program is on new areas within chemical          engineering and on novel applications in traditional areas.  The                program will give each participant a formal introduction to research            and a well defined project with faculty supervision, but the                    participants will also be encouraged to be creative and independent as          they develop.                                                                   The students will be paid stipends of $ 2,000 for the ten week program          in addition to being housed and fed on campus.  A travel allowance for          each student is also included in the budget.  Although the program is           not limited to minorities and women, an effort will be made to include          a significant fraction from these groups.                                       The combination of extensive facilities and a commitment to                     undergraduate research provides important characteristics.  The                 faculty is committed to this program.  Research projects include                lipid-water phase behavior and bacterial growth, polymer properties             and productive, solubility vapors in polymers, instrument interfacing,          supercritical fluid technology, and computer simulation of                      physisorption phenomena.",
