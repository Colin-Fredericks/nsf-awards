 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last ten years have seen a host of new results in the                  field of nonlinear dynamics, most notably regarding the                         phenomenon called chaos.  Many recent results have come from                    mathematicians and from theoretical and experimental physicists;                yet much of the early work was motivated by issues in population                dynamics.  A recurrent theme of this recent resarch is that                     seemingly random fluctuations often occur as the result of                      simple deterministic mechanisms.  Hence, much of the recent work                in non-linear dynamics has centered on new techniques for                       identifying order in seemingly chaotic systems.  These techniques               when applied in ecology have led to new insights for several                    systems, most notably various childhood epidemics.  To determine                the robustness of these techniques, chaos must, to some extent,                 be brought into the laboratory.  Preliminary investigations of                  the forced double-Monod equations, a model for a predator and a                 prey in a chemostat with periodic variation in inflowing                        substrate concentration, suggest that simple microbial systems                  may provide the perfect framework for determining the efficacy                  and relevance of the new nonlinear dynamics in dealing with                     complex population dynamics.  This proposal will provide a                      thorough examination of the mathematical properties of the forced               double-Monod model and an experimental investigation of the self-               same system.",
