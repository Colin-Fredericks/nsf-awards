 "awd_abstract_narration": "Xyloglucans are plant cell wall matrix polysaccharides that are                 synthesized by enzymes in the membranes of the Golgi apparatus.                 Xyloglucan plays a central role in both cell wall structure and                 function.  In addition, it may have a regulatory function in the                process of controlling plant growth and development.  It is a                   complex polysaccharide, yet compared to some it is relatively                   simple.  This proposal describes a program of research designed                 to clarify the activities of xyloglucan synthase enzymes and the                products they make.  The overall objective of this project is to                refine the xyloglucan biosynthesis system for use as a model for                the study of both plant cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and               the structure and functional organization of the plant Golgi                    apparatus.  These two research topics are closely related and                   completion of this research will significantly increase our                     understanding of both.  Golgi membranes isolated from suspension-               cultured Acer pseudoplatanus (sycamore maple) cells are being                   subfractionated and these partially purified membrane fractions                 are being used as a source of xyloglucan synthases.  Combinations               of glycosyl composition analysis, methylation linkage analysis,                 and radiogas proportional counting are being used to determine                  identities of incorporated radiolabeled residues and the linkages               between them.  The glycosyl transferases involved with xyloglucan               synthesis is being purified so that eventual subcellular                        localization and compartment mapping of plant Golgi are possible.               Successful completion of this study will result in a greater                    understanding of the process of plant cell wall synthesis as well               as the structure and function of the plant apparatus.                                                                                                           There are many unanswered fundamental questions in plant biology.               What influence cell wall biogenesis has on plant growth and                     development is one such question.  This research offers an                      opportunity for progress in this area.  Xyloglucans are an                      important component of plant cell walls both structurally and                   functionally.  They allow the cell wall to maintain a degree of                 flexibility and are implicated in auxin-stimulated elongation                   during growth.  This research is an in-depth study of the                       biosynthesis of these important cell wall sugars and provides a                 better understanding of the Golgi apparatus which produces the                  enzymes responsible for their synthesis.",
