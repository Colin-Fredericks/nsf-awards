 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on two topics:  (1) Asymmetric bidders and                coalitions of bidders at first price auctions and, (2) Dynamic                  latent variables and disequilibrium models.  The topics share the               characteristic of being analytically intractable and, therefore,                requiring numerical techniques for investigation.  Hardware and                 software methods have made a computational approach to these                    problems feasible.  One reason the first topic is important is                  that the federal government uses first price auctions extensively               for both the sale and procurement of commodities.  Nevertheless,                very little is understood about the feasibility of coalitions                   forming at these auctions.  If all bidders are identical and if                 coalitions of bidders are possible, then their bids stem from a                 source that is fundamentally different from the source for the                  bids of non-colluding bidders.  Consequently, a first step in                   analyzing bidder collusion is to understand the behavior of                     heterogeneous bidders who act non-cooperatively.  Solutions will                be obtained for first price auction models and the results                      utilized to understand and characterize the circumstances under                 which bidders can profitably collude.                                                                                                                           One reason the second topic is important is because the latent                  variable technique can be used in estimating models of the U.S.                 money demand where a number of important variables are inherently               latent (or unobserved) and dynamic.  Examples of these variables                are expected and permanent income and often the measure of money,               itself.  The investigators have developed a technique for                       numerically simulating the unobserved variables that permits                    inferences to be drawn without removing the latent variables.",
