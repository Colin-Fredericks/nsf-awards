 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for doctoral dissertation research in decision risk, and             management science will support research costs for work on the                  dissertation, \"The Relation of Gainsharing, Work Climate, and Social            Performance.\"   This project will integrate organization theory with            businesss-and-society theory.  The empirical examination of multiple            stakeholder models has led organization theorists to conclude that it           is extremely difficult for managers to fulfill the conflicting needs of         internal and external stakeholders.  Missing from this body of research         is an examination of intervening variables.  Business-and-society               theorists have proposed that participatory management is an attribute           of socially responsible companies and that it is likely to enhance a            company's social performance.                                                                                                                                   The dissertation will empirically examine the relationship between              gainsharing (an institutional form of participatory management) and a           company's social performance as it pertains to multiple stockholders.           Two companies with successful gainsharing plans will be contrasted              with two companies with less successful gainsharing plans, through              interviews, examinations of archivaal data, field observations, and             surveys.  This work will provide theory and data of use for firms'              managers on (1) the relationship between a company's standard operating         policies, and procedures associated with gainsharing and its social             performance, and (2) the relationship between a company's work climate          and its social performance.",
