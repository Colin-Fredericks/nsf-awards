 "awd_abstract_narration": "The curriculum in biology is being enhanced through the acquisition of          an ultracentrifuge and kinetic microplate reader. The equipment is              being used in the Genetics, Immunology and Microbiology courses to              introduce new exercises which employ modern techniques and principles           of critical thinking. The equipment increases the variety of projects           students may undertake in the Methods in Research course and in                 undergraduate student research projects. The ultracentrifuge enables            students to purify plasmic DNA for restriction endonuclease double              digestion mapping and gene cloning, and to purify prokaryotic and               eukaryotic genomic DNA and RNA for Southern and Northern blot analyses          with non-radioactive labeled probes. The kinetic microplate reader is           used by students for performing the ELISA immunoassay, for cell                 proliferation studies using the MTT assay, for monoclonal antibody              analyses, for the Lowry protein assay and for the screning of sera and          cultured supernatants for the presence of antibody following                    immunological in vivo or in vitro stimulation procedures, respectively.         The equipment improves the biology program being offered to students            majoring in biology or allied health, many of whom are women. The               college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
