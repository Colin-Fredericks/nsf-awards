 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will attempt to broaden the scope               of certain algebraic techniques of proven geometric utility.  In                the 1960's Daniel Quillen showed how to define homology and                     cohomology in many categories.  These included simplicial sets,                 where he obtained the ordinary cohomology of topological spaces,                but the categories of simplicial algebras over a field and                      simplicial unstable algebras over the mod-p Steenrod algebra both               support an idea of cohomology that is relevant in homotopy                      theory.  Cohomology of simplicial unstable algebras, for example,               is the correct context for studying the E2 term of the Bousfield-               Kan spectral sequence, an unstable Adams-type spectral sequence                 which has gained prominence due to the work of Haynes Miller,                   Jean Lannes and others.                                                              Under prior NSF grants, the principal investigator has made                a successful study of the Quillen-type cohomology in various                    categories of algebras.  The purpose of this project is to take                 these results and to extend and apply them.  In particular, he                  should now be able to make an in-depth study of Barratt's                       desuspension spectral sequence and his \"Lie ring analyzer\" - both               a source of conjecture and speculation for 30 years.  Other                     projects include combining the Quillen-type cohomology techniques               with the methods of Chris Stover to approach the homotopy groups                of a wedge of two spaces, the study of a spectral sequence for                  computing the homotopy groups of a space of sections, and an                    exploration of the homology of function complexes using tools of                Jean Lannes and A.K. Bousfield.",
