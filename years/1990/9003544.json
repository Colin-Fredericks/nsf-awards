 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this study is to identify the macromolecules                 involved in the regulation of microtubule assembly during the                   interphase-to- mitosis transition in developing sea urchin                      embryos. Unfertilized sea urchin eggs are arrested at G1 of the                 first mitotic cycle and have few, if any assembled microtubules                 despite a large pool of tubulin subunits.  Following                            fertilization microtubules of the first cleavage mitotic                        apparatus are synchronously assembled.  Therefore the                           developing sea urchin embryo can be viewed as an inducible model                system for studying the regulation of microtubule assembly.                                                                                                          It has been recently discovered that interphase-arrested egg               cells contain two novel inhibitors of microtubule assembly- a                   minus-end inhibitor and a pH-dependent plus-end inhibitor.  The                 goal of the proposed research is to isolate and characterize                    these unique factors during the cell cycle.  Preliminary                        experiments with such diverse sources as sea urchin eggs, surf                  clam oocytes, mouse B16 cultured melanoma cells, squid optic lobe               and mammalian brain tissue suggest that these negative control                  factors may exist in all eukaryotic cells, particularly where                   cytoplasmic microtubules are rapidly assembled and disassembled                 in a controlled manner during the cell cycle.                                                                                                                        The interconversion of mitotic and interphase microtubule                  arrays during the cell cycle is a fundamental problem of cellular               morphogenesis.  The process is of obvious importance for cell                   division but also for developmental processes such as neuronal                  growth and plasticity.  These studies are expected to increase                  our understanding of fundamental mechanisms whereby microtubule                 assembly is regulated in the living cell.",
