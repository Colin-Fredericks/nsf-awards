 "awd_abstract_narration": "Techniques for handling non-stationarity in signals and images have             been explored in different areas; wavelet analysis in applied                   mathematics, multi-rate filter bank techniques in digital signal                processing and multi-resolution analysis in computer vision.                    Recent developments have indicated the connection between these                 various techniques.  A goal of this work is to make a thorough                  exploration of the connections between these three areas and                    present a unified view of existing problems, techniques and                     applications.  Further, design of new regular wavelets, examination             of associated computational structures and a study of the                       complexity of the wavelet transform are also pursued.  Finally,                 design of non-separable multi-dimensional wavelets, new wavelet-                based-sampling methods and application to image coding are                      attempted.",
