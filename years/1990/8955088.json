This is                           particularly important inasmuch as Science is the common                        denominator of the emerging world culture, and Evolution is                     one of the most important scientific principles.                                                                                                                The program will offer a five-unit preparatory course during                    the Winter Quarter.  This course consists of extensive                          readings in and discussions of the original literature from                     the writings of Charles Darwin and his forerunners to those                     of Gergor Mendel to the most recent works on mutations.  The                    climax of the course is an 11-day field trip during the                         Spring break to the Galapogos Islands to relive the                             experiences of Charles Darwin that were the key to his                          developing the concept of Evolution through Natural                             Selection.  The field trip will be followed up by special                       reports during the Spring quarter and together constitute a                     three-unit sequel course.                                                                                                                                       An amount equivalent to 175.89% of the NSF award is being                       contributed as cost-sharing.",
