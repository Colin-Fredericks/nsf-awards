 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Elias                Aifantis, Michigan Technological University and Dr. Joel Lepinoux,              Laboratory for Physical Metallurgy, Poitiers, France.  The                      objective of the project is the study of dislocation-crack                      interactions under dynamical situations.  Various conditions                    including mixed loading modes, as well as the influence of                      environment and microstructure will be considered.                                                                                                              Two general approaches will be used:  1) classical dislocation                  simulations in two dimensions and 2) nonlinear dislocation                      dynamics.  The possibility of using the cellular automata method                will also be explored.  The results of this research may lead to a              framework for considering crack stability and growth, as well as a              new fundamental understanding of fracture toughness related                     phenomena.  This project will benefit from the complementary                    expertise of the two investigators.  Both groups have been working              for several years on the problem of self organization of disloca-               tions by using two different methods:  nonlinear dynamics (US) and              simulation with cellular automata (France).",
