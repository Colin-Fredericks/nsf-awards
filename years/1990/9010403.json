 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the development of the                        theory of lattice transformations as used in image                              processing and the application of the theory to two                             specific areas: mapping lattice transforms to special                           architectures, and the development of morphological                             neural networks.  Lattice transforms, which include the                         transforms of mathematical morphology, are described by                         minimax algebra, a mathematical structure that mimics                           many properties of linear algebra.  A high-level image                          processing language called image algebra provides the                           link between minimax algebra and lattice transforms.                                                                                                            This research proposes to extend the mathematical                               foundations of minimax algebra in areas which will                              advance solutions to image processing problems.                                 Specifically, decomposition techniques will be developed                        that will increase the tools available for mapping lattice                      transforms to parallel and sequential architectures with                        reduced computation.  The initial investigation will seek                       to mimic linear techniques using minimax algebra.  Also,                        a theory of novel neural computation involving                                  morphological-type operations will be broadened by                              developing training rules and identifying-applications for                      this new type of neural network.                                                                                                                                The significance of the proposed research to the state-                         of-the-art is that it aims to increase the theoretical tools                    available for performing lattice-related image processing                       analysis in two important areas, transform decomposition                        and neural computing.",
