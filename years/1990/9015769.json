 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric ozone and other photochemical oxidants will be                 studied at a rural mountain site in the Shenandoah Mountains of                 Virginia, a region surrounded by natural hydrocarbon emissions                  and downwind of the industrialized midwest and the urbanized                    eastern seaboard.  Measurements of nitric oxide, ozone and UV                   light will be co-located and coincident with measurements of non-               methane hydrocarbons, carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids,                     particulate and gaseous inorganic anions and cations, organic                   nitrates, hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides, which are               to be measured in clear air, interstitial air in cloud, and in                  two descrete size fractions of cloud water.  The data sets will                 be combined and used to investigate net ozone production and                    oxidants in clear and cloudy air at a forested rural site with                  variable hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations.  The                    combined data sets will be further used to elucidate mechanisms                 of natural hydrocarbon oxidation.  The measurements represent the               first concurrent set of measurements in the gas and aqueous                     phases of non-methane hydrocarbons, their partially oxidized                    products (carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids, organic                         hydroperoxides, organic nitrates), and the factors controlling                  ozone and other oxidants in-cloud.",
