 "awd_abstract_narration": "The direct synthesis of high temperature materials by                           combustion can proceed in different fashion depending upon the                  phases of the reactants.  When one reactant is a gas and the                    other is a compact powder, the process is termed filtration                     combustion.  Various analyses of solid-solid combustion and an                  initial analysis of the planar counter-flow mode (ie., the                      reactant gas velocity and the combustion wave move in opposite                  directions) have already been completed.  The current research                  will extend this to include the co-flowing and diffusional                      modes of filtration combustion.  Additionally, the following                    topics will be addressed:  transient modes of propagation                       (stable and unstable), nonadiabatic effects, two-step                           kinetics, effects of melting of the reactant, densification                     during reaction, and application of adaptive pseudospectral                     methods to numerically modelling multi-dimensional flame                        propagation.                                                                                                                                                    Self-propagating high temperature synthesis is an innovative                    method for fabrication of ceramic and metallic materials.  The                  theoretical study, to be performed in collaboration with the                    Chernogolovka Institute of Structural Macrokinetics as part of                  the US-USSR Cooperation in the Field of Basic Scientific                        Research Program, will yield insight into the complex                           phenomena involved.  The results will aid in explaining past                    observed behavior and designing future experiments necessary                    to make the process competitive.",
