 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Dietrich Kessler, Colgate University and Dr. Jennifer Dee,                      Department of Genetics, University of Leicester, England.                       The objective of the proposed research is the investigation                     of the molecular basis of actomyosin-based cell motility in                     non-muscle cells.                                                                                                                                               As a model system, the investigators will use the myxomycete                    Physarum polycephallum, a protist with rapid protoplasmic                       movement.  This possesses a well-defined meiotic life cycle,                    which can be manipulated genetically in the laboratory. In                      the study, Drs. Kessler and Dee propose to collect a variety                    of different motility mutants in both vegetative stages of the                  life cycle, amoebae and plasmodia. Later the mutants will be                    essential for cloning the genes and studying the proteins                       important for motility and its regulation in this organism.The                  results of this project will be of great interest to                            investigators interested in the mechanism of cytoplasmic                        movement in individual cells from a variety of organisms.                       This project will benefit from the complementary expertise of                   the two investigators.  Dr. Kessler has studied actomyosin-                     based motility in Physarum for many years, and brings first-                    hand knowledge to the project about the biochemical mechanism                   of motility and its regulation in this organism, and in                         skeletal muscle. Dr. Dee brings great experience with genetic                   techniques in studying Physarum, in particular using screening                  procedures for the isolation of mutants.",
