This earthquake caused liquefaction to occur                                    at many sites in the San Francisco Bay area.                                    Liquefaction, a very damaging form of soil                                      failure, caused considerable damage during                                      both the 1906 San Francisco and the 1989 Loma                                   Prieta earthquakes.  Current techniques for                                     determining the liquefaction resistance of a                                    soil deposit utilize an indirect method by                                      correlating the soil penetration resistance                                     and shear wave velocity with the liquefaction                                   potential.                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of this research program is to                                      study an alternative technique which gives a                                    more direct measure of the potential for a                                      soil deposit to liquefy, namely through a                                       direct in-situ measurement of the change in                                     soil pore pressure when subjected to shear                                      strain.  This is achieved by using a shear                                      vane. This CSU (Colorado State University)                                      Piezovane measures instantaneous changes in                                     pore pressure during rapid rotation of the                                      vane.                                                                                                                                                           The objective of this research program is to                                    apply the CSU Piezovane to identify the                                         material susceptible to liquefaction, by                                        conducting a systematic research                                                investigation of sites in the San Francisco                                     Bay area that liquefied during the Loma                                         Prieta earthquake.  It is expected that this                                    information will add significantly to the                                       comprehensive geotechnical investigations to                                    gather similar data that have been performed                                    since the Loma Prieta earthquake.",
