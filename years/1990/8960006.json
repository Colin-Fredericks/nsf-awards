 "awd_abstract_narration": "A reduction in the use of chemical pesticides would have                   desirable human health as well as environmental benefits.                       Consequently, the U.S. Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region,                has adopted a pest management policy which would give preference                to non-chemical pest control measures.  Unfortunately, since                    reliable, non-chemical control measures are not available for                   fungal root diseases of conifers, chemicals must still be used.                      Newly developed technologies are available for obtaining                   effective environmentally safe strains of microorganisms which                  will protect plants from root disease.  New methods for coating                 seeds with these beneficial organisms have also been developed.                 These technologies have not been applied to forest nurseries.                        Research will be conducted on the use of new protoplast                    fusion progeny of Trichoderma and new seed coating technologies                 in biological disease control systems in forest nurseries.  Co-                 inoculation with selected strains of ectomycorrhizal fungi,                     Laccaria and Rhizopogon, will also be performed.  The test system               will be for control of damping-off and root rot diseases of                     Douglas-fir caused by Pythium, Fusarium, Phytophthora, and                      Cylindrocarpon.  The anticipated outcome will be a new seed                     coating product available to federal, State and private forest                  nurseries for biological disease control of fungal root diseases                of conifers.                                                                         Such systems could also be adapted for food crops as well as               horticultural and ornamental industries. The localized nature of                biocontrol needs for each type of crop could stimulate the                      development of small biotechnology companies.",
