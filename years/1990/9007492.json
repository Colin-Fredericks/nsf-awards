 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of conflicts between mutualists and their                          evolutionary consequences are critical for understanding how                    both mutualisms and antagonisms arise and persist.  However,                    nearly all studies of mutualisms focus on the interests of one of               the partners only.  The proposed study of two sympatric                         fig/pollinator mutualisms will investigate the nature and                       consequences of one pivotal mutualistic trait within-tree                       reproductive phenology, from the perspective of both partners.                  Using detailed observations and a set of manipulative                           experiments.  The P.I. will (1) provide the first quantitative                  description of the relevant phenological traits for any fig                     species; (2) define patterns of phenological variation at the                   scales of branch, tree, local site, region, species, and season;                (3) measure reproductive consequences of within-tree phenology                  for each mutualist partner; and (4) use this information to test                a set of hypotheses for the cause of phenological differences                   among and within fig species.  The costs and benefits of                        phenological traits critical for the maintenance of these                       interactions as mutualisms will be established for the first time               by this study.  More broadly, it will demonstrate the value of a                reciprocal rather than unilateral approach to understanding                     ecological and evolutionary dynamics of a mutualism.                            These results from this study will have important implications in               many natural communities.",
