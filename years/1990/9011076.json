 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the long-time behavior               of wave phenomena in media with periodic microstructure.  In                    particular, the research consists of two major lines of inquiry.                The first one is the use of analytical methods derived from                     multi-scale asymptotics to obtain an effective medium theory that               is valid for long times when dispersion effects are important.                  The second one is the construction and implementation of                        numerical schemes that employ relatively large grids to describe                accurately the fine structure of waves as well as their bulk                    properties.  Research such as this has applications to many                     diverse areas, including seismology, oil exploration and                        crystallography.                                                                     Wave phenomena are a familiar and significant part of the                  natural world.  Over the last century mathematicians and fluid                  dynamicists have developed fairly accurate theories that describe               the behavior of waves in homogeneous media such as air or water,                theories that have been validated through extensive laboratory                  experiments.  In contrast to this, our understanding of the                     behavior of waves in homogeneous media is very limited, due in                  large measure to the difficulty of performing reliable                          experiments.  For example, understanding the behavior of                        (seismic) waves inside of the earth is crucial to any theory of                 earthquakes, and yet it is well nigh impossible to set up an                    experiment that would allow us to measure such complicated                      phenomena.  Thus recourse must be had to mathematical models of                 waves in inhomogeneous media.  In this proposal the principal                   investigator will use analytical and numerical techniques to                    describe the propagation of waves in periodic media.",
