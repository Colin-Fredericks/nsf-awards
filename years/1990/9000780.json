Students will be trained in                   anthropometry, osteopathology, tissue sample collection, trace                  metal and stable isotope analyses, and biological differentiation               of skeletal samples as tools for studying adaption to physical and              cultural environments through time.  Such experiences have proven               useful to students majoring in anthropology, biology or ecology and             interested in pursuing an interdisciplinary approach towards a                  common objective--namely, paleodietary reconstruction.                          Undergraduate students from these fields will work together as a                team to realize this common goal.  They will acquire invaluable                 experience in the filed and subsequently in the laboratory as the               data are collected and analyzed.  The U.S. institutions involved                will be collaborating with the University of Tarapaca in northern               Chile.  The faculty team has established a well-defined research                project for undergraduate training in paleonutrition reconstruction             based on well-preserved mummies and skeletal remains spanning the               last 8,000 years from northern Chile.  The students will learn how              to formulate and test hypotheses, they will learn new techniques                and be in a position to assess the value of these techniques for                future studies.",
