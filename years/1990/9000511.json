Schmidt of the                       University of Minnesota in a research collaboration with                        Professor Miguel Jose Yacaman of the Universidad Nacional                       Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, Mexico.  The                          researchers intend to establish on a more formal basis an                       ongoing program on heterogeneous catalysis.  In particular,                     they plan to prepare catalysts, characterize their reactivity                   in different atmospheres, and determine how micro-                              structure affects reactivity.  Attention will be directed at                    Rh-Ce catalyst particles in the NO+CO reaction and Pt-Sn                        particles in hydrocarbon hydrogenolysis and isomerization.                      These systems are used as automotive pollution catalysts and                    petroleum refining catalysts, respectively and are therefore                    of great importance to both the U.S. and Mexico.                                                                                                                This award will help to promote the exchange of students,                       senior personnel, catalyst samples, and TEM micrographics                       between both institutions.  The group at the University of                      Minnesota has been primarily interested in the relation of                      structure and reactivity while the UNAM group will contribute                   their expertise in micro-structure characterization.",
