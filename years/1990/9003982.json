 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this workshop are: (1) to                                     review the state of the art of long wave                                        (tsunami) runup onto a coastline; (2) help                                      identify areas where knowledge is fragmented                                    and incomplete; (3) assist in the transfer of                                   information between theory and practice; (4)                                    address the issues of the maintenance of                                        numerical codes for runup predictions, and                                      the development of certain bench mark                                           problems for calibration and comparison                                         purposes; and (5) suggest future directions                                     in tsunami runup hazard mitigation research.                                                                                                                    The attendance of tsunami researchers from                                      Japan and the Soviet Union is an important                                      component in the planning of the workshop.                                      Tsunami research is very active in these                                        countries, but due to communication                                             difficulties, this research is not well known                                   in the United States.  Another goal of this                                     meeting is to bring together researchers who                                    do not normally interact.  This workshop                                        brings together coastal engineers,                                              oceanographers, geologists and mathematicians                                   engaged in the study of wave runup, thereby                                     improving the communication between                                             specialists from different scientific                                           disciplines who work on different aspects of                                    the runup problem.                                                                                                                                              The workshop addresses the related problem of                                   computer code maintenance: given the expense                                    of developing new codes or of resurrecting                                      existing ones, guidelines are needed for the                                    maintenance of existing codes.  The                                             dissemination of these codes is also of                                         concern.  Given the current capabilities of                                     electronic mail, it appears that this offers                                    a convenient method of dissemination, but                                       there is a need to agree upon protocols for                                     governing the transfer of research codes.                                                                                                                       It is expected that this workshop will have a                                   very positive effect on directing research                                      toward tsunami hazard mitigation, including a                                   more conspicuous effort to contribute to the                                    state of the art of tsunami warning systems                                     (which are the responsibility of the National                                   Weather Service within the National Oceanic                                     and Atmospheric Administration).",
