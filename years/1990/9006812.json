 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two on-going research projects; (1) Computer Simulation                         of hyperthermic Cancer Therapy and (2) Hydrodynamic                             Simulations of Continental Shelf Oceanography share a                           common need for high performance graphics                                       workstations - both require the construction, display, and                      the manipulation of complex geometrical models for                              three-dimensional finite element analysis.  The limitations                     imposed by conventional two-dimensional projections of                          three-dimensional objects necessitates that graphical                           processing occur in real-time in order to verify data input                     and analyze data output.                                                                                                                                        The hyperthermia research involves the construction of                          three-dimensional anatomical models of the human body                           as computational domains which are used to analyze                              understand and define adequate thermal dose delivery.                           The hydrodynamic numerical studies focuses on selected                          oceanographic processes such as tides and currents and                          their effects on temperature profiles, nutrient                                 distributions as well as other environmental factors.                           Detailed geometrical representations of the complex                             waterways, e.g. Gulf of Maine, Alboran Sea, etc., are                           necessary for accurate simulations.                                                                                                                             Despite the distinctively different phenomenon involved                         both research projects share the feature that the fine                          geometrical details have a major influence on the                               computed results.  The action provides partial support                          for the purchase of a Silicon-Graphics IRIS graphics                            workstation which will be networked with the existing                           computational resources within the Numerical Methods                            Laboratory of the Thayer School.",
