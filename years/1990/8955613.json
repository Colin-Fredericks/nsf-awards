The goal of the NSF Young Scholars                       Pacific Region Program is to increase the knowledge of high                     ability high school students in the careers, philosophy and                     ethics, and research methodology in the agricultural                            sciences.  The Program will include both a summer program and                   follow-up activities.  The former will consist of four inter-                   related learning experiences:  classroom sessions; field                        trips; research projects under the guidance of scientific                       mentors; and informal learning situations.  Participants, who                   will come from Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, and                    the Northern Marianas, will live in University of Hawaii                        dormitories and use the facilities of the University and its                    College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources.  They                      will be selected on PSAT or SAT scores, high school grades,                     recommendation from teachers or counselors, and students'                       essays.  During the academic year students will continue work                   on their research projects and participate in a follow-up                       meeting.",
