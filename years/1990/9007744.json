The workshop will be held at                         the University of Nebraska, Lincoln from September 10-14,                       1990 and is being principally supported by the NATO                             Scientific Affairs Division.  This award from NSF will                          permit extending support for participation in this                              conference by Dr. Jaroslav Vrba, Chairman of the                                Commission for Groundwater Protections of the                                   International Association of Hydrogeologists                                    (Czechoslovakia) who will speak on Hydrogeological System                       Nitrate Contamination - Origin and Control in Eastern                           European Countries, or by an alternative person on a                            similar topic.                                                                                                                                                  Results of this workshop are expected to provide guidance                       to the program in its support of research on groundwater                        pollution from substances that contribute nitrogenous                           substances to groundwater aquifers.",
