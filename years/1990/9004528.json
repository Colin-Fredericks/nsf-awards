 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium provides an up-to-date assessment of our knowledge               of the biosynthesis, metabolism and molecular biology of                        polyamines and ethylene.  Presentations by outstanding                          researchers in the field will provide a critical analysis of the                involvement of polyamines and ethylene in plant growth,                         development, and responses to stress.  The antagonistic roles of                these molecules in senescence, plant stress and development will                be examined, as well as the possible regulatory mechanisms for                  the ethylene and polyamine pathways.                                                                                                                            Polyamines and ethylene are the two important topics that will be               discussed during the 5th Annual Penn State Symposium in Plant                   Physiology.  Polyamines are compounds that have been implicated                 as markers for male fertility and in flower development.                        Evidence also suggests that polyamines may retard senescence.                   Ethylene has been shown to play an important regulatory role in                 many physiological processes including sex expression, flower                   initiation and the promotion of senescence.  The purpose of this                symposium is to address a variety of topics on polyamine and                    researchers working on these two distinct yet overlapping                       subjects and provide a catalyst for innovative approaches in the                future.  The symposium will provide students and post doctoral                  fellows an unusual opportunity to meet and interact in a small                  group setting with the leaders in this research area.  The                      published proceedings will provide an up-to-date review of                      research in these rapidly advancing fields which will be of                     general value to students and scientists in colleges and                        universities, government, and industry.",
