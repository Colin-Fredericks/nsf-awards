 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will characterize gas-liquid mass                         transfer in mycelial fermentations and optimize reactor                         performance utilizing a model mycelial fermentation.  A                         new chemical technique for the measurement of mass                              transfer coefficient will be utilized to characterize the                       gas-liquid mass transfer.  An unsteady-state chemical                           technique utilizing an instantaneous reaction between                           ozone and indigo dye has been developed and is well-                            suited for modelling mycelial fermentations because of                          low ionic strengths and ease of data collection and                             analysis.  The biological phase will be modeled with                            cellulose fibers, which in suspension behave similarly to                       mycelular growths.                                                                                                                                              This model system will be used to characterize the gas-                         liquid mass transfer as a function of stirrer speed,                            gassing rate and solids concentration in a variety of                           agitated reactors.  The replacement of turbine agitators                        with hydrofoil impellers has significant industrial                             interest, primarily due to energy savings and lower shear                       exposure for the mycelial broth.  The reaction of glucose                       to gluconic acid by Aspergillus niger will be carried out in                    the most promising reactor configurations to determine if                       the improvements in gas-liquid mass transfer translate                          into improvements in the mycelular reactor performance.",
