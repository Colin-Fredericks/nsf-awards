 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research in Undergraduate Institutions grant is in the                     general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the                     subfield of separations science.  Professor Robert Kooser of                    Knox College will use electron spin resonance studies of probe                  molecules to follow the dynamics of structural changes in                       flowing liquid chromatographic systems.  The research will                      advance the knowledge of the structure of the liquid/solid                      interface and the structure of stationary phases used for                       separations.  In addition, the research program will introduce                  three undergraduates each summer to the various aspects of                      instrumental analysis, computer data acquisition and                            spectroscopy.  The multidisciplinary aspect of this study will                  allow for a well designed undergraduate research experience.                                                                                                    Using the loop gap resonator electron spin resonance cell,                      Professor Kooser and his students will study the structure of                   common stationary phase materials while under flow.  The                        research group at Knox College has been successful in                           synthesizing new types of spin label functionalities directly                   at particular positions in silane surface modifier compounds.                   In this study, the nitroxyl probe functionality will be                         directly bonded in low concentrations of alkyl chains attached                  to the silica in a reversed phase stationary phase.  By                         constructing a flow cell in the loop gap resonator, the                         mobility of the particular spin probe as a function of size and                 position may be monitored.  This will allow determination of                    structure for many species under conditions never probed                        previously.",
