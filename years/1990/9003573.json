The proposed research deals with the economic                                   and social aspects of the Loma Prieta                                           earthquake, focusing on earthquake insurance                                    issues, impacts of the earthquake on the                                        behavior of individuals, and changes in                                         perception of the earthquake hazard following                                   the earthquake.  It involves a re-survey of                                     California homeowners whose attitudes towards                                   the earthquake hazard and insurance purchase                                    decisions were assessed in May of 1989, as                                      well as a supplemental survey of residents of                                   Santa Clara county.  In this project, the                                       impacts of this earthquake on shifts in                                         attitudes towards earthquake hazards in                                         general and the purchase of earthquake                                          insurance in particular will be tested as well                                  as the impact of geographic location of the                                     household with respect to recent property                                       damage on subsequent insurance purchase.",
