 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identification of a virus is a two step process, requiring                      collecting information about a set of characteristics of the                    unknown and then comparing that set to data stored on known                     viruses.  The process of comparison is eased if different                       laboratories use well-standardized descriptors and can readily                  compare their values to reference data sets.  Several different                 approaches have already been developed to meet these needs.  Now                is an opportune time to evaluate each of these and determine the                feasibility and utility of coordinating the development of an                   interdisciplinary standard for coding descriptors.                                                                                                              Because of its commitment to maintaining information on diverse                 viruses, the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) will promote               interaction among professionals interested in this effort by                    hosting an exploratory two-day workshop including representatives               of several virology societies, nomenclature groups, and knowledge               base developers.  This meeting will serve to evaluate current                   projects, suggest solutions, and enlist the support of scientific               societies.  The report of this meeting will:  1) evaluate the                   need for standardization;  2) identify the participants who would               be represented in any such effort and  3) serve as one basis for                evaluation of future funding by granting agencies.",
