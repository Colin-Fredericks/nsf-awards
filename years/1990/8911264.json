 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade, there has been a great deal of work in using                intertemporal general equilibrium models to analyze problems in                 monetary theory. Professor Woodford aims at building up a general               theory of money in an intertemporal equilibrium framework                       involving financial market imperfections and heterogeneous                      consumers. Preliminary results indicate  close connections                      between market structure and demographic assumptions. The set of                models that being analyzed under this project also involve                      incomplete markets, an infinite time-horizon, cash-in-advance                   and a time-varying distribution of money holdings.                                                                                                              Long term payoffs of this research could provide some extremely                 important policy-related results. Specifically, Professor                       Woodford is attempting to find a generalized framework for the                  redistributive fiscal effects of monetary interventions (such as                open-market operations). These alternative fiscal effects will                  lead to differing influences on the price level and other real                  economic variables.",
