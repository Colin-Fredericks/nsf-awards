 "awd_abstract_narration": "They propose to design, build, develop, and characterize a                      new narrowband, broadly tunable, pulsed, solid state laser                      source based on the newly emerging alexandrite laser                            technology.  Present day pulsed narrowband tunable laser                        sources of the type required for high resolution spectroscopy,                  photochemical studies, and analytical chemistry are based on                    dye laser technology and are relatively expensive and                           cumbersome to use.  The proposed source, when completed,                        will provide new capabilities in spectral purity, pulse duration                versatility, pulse energy and reliability.  Perhaps  most                       importantly, when augmented by nonlinear conversion                             methods based on stimulated raman scattering (SRS) and                          second and third harmonic generation, a general light source                    useful for chemical applications will become available that                     provides enormous cost benefits, reliability and operating                      simplicity over previous technology.  This source, we believe,                  will greatly improve the amount of time researchers can                         spend on performing experiments rather than maintaining                         lasers and will permit multi laser experiments to be                            performed vastly more easily and at many more laboratories                      than is possible today.",
