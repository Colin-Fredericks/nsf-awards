 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to determine how the structure of                     photosystem II (PSII) and associated cofactors mediate electron                 transfer from water to the primary electron donor, P680.  The                   focus of this project is on the role of the D1 reaction center                  polypetide of PSII in oxygen evolution.  The powerful tools of                  molecular genetics are being used to mutagenize the chloroplast                 gene coding for D1, transform the mutant gene back into the                     choroplast of the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and                    characterize the transformants.  In a directed approach, specific               amino acid residues are being targeted for change.  In a broader                approach, specific portions of the gene are being altered, both                 by deletion and by random mutagenesis.  These changes in D1 are                 being characterized to determine their effect on PSII stability,                D1 stability, oxygen evolution and fluorescence induction                       kinetics.  Transformants with defects in oxygen evolution are                   being genetically crossed with specific mutant strains of C.                    reinhardtii which are lacking photosynthetic membrane complexes,                including Photosystem I (PSI), to produce strains which                         facilitate our isolation of relatively pure oxygen-evolving                     membrane preparations, free from PSI contamination and suitable                 for spectroscopic studies of PSII electron transfer.  These                     strains are being further characterized in conjuction with Dr.                  Bruce Diner (DuPont de Nemours) who is performing detailed                      spectroscopic analyses and electron transfer and rates of oxygen                evolution in transformants.  EPR analyses are being performed on                these strains in conjunction with Dr. Gary Brudvig (Yale                        University).  Finally, suppressor mutants of selected                           transformant strains in which oxygen evolution is restored as a                 result of a second mutation are being identified and                            characterized.  This technique provides further insight into                    inter- and intra-molecular structural relationships critical to                 PSII function.                                                                                                                                                  Terrestrial, aquatic and marine plants are the primary source of                renewable biomass on earth.  Through the process of                             photosynthesis plants convert radiant energy received from the                  sun into chemical energy.  This energy drives the conversion of                 atomospheric carbon dioxide into sugars and other compounds, such               as fats and proteins, which are essential components of all                     living organisms.  Photosynthesis also results in the production                of oxygen, and this oxygen is crucial for sustaining all forms of               life that rely on respiration in order to provide the energy to                 keep them alive.  The purpose of this research project is to gain               an increased understanding of the biochemical and physical                      reactions that take place during photosynthesis by plants,                      resulting in the production of oxygen and consumption of carbon                 dioxide.  Most of this research will be done on a simple                        unicellular plant which is well suited to analysis by modern                    molecular biology and therefore provides an excellent model                     system for study.",
