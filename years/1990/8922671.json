 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theoretical treatment of atomic and molecular systems has                   benefited greatly in the past thirty years from the development                 and evolution of high speed computing facilities.  In                           particular, with the help of computers, scientists are now able                 to explore the myriad implications of quantum theory and                        statistical mechanics, and analyze much more completely the                     information derived from experiments.  As a result, scientists                  are much closer to realizing the eventual goal of being able to                 understand and predict the structure, dynamics, and reactivity                  of atoms and molecules.  Electronic structure theory has been                   one of the primary beneficiaries of the increased capacity and                  speed present in modern computers.                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will aid the Chemistry Department at the University of                          Pittsburgh purchase a mini-supercomputer.  This computer will                   be used in the following research areas of study:                                                                                                               1.
