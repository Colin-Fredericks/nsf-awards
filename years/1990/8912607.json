 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three year cooperative research project               between U.S. and British mechanical engineers on the topic of                   modeling and simulation of two-dimensional flames in turbulent                  flows.  The U.S. investigators, Dr. Mitchell Smooke and Dr.                     Marshall Long, both from Yale University, will collaborate in this              work with Professor K. Bray and Dr. B. Rogg, Department of                      Engineering, Cambridge University, England.  The investigators                  propose to examine the effects of flame curvature and partial                   premixing in two-dimensional combustion systems.  Until now the                 geometries employed in modeling both nonpremixed turbulent combustion           using the laminar flamelet concept have been too simple in the                  sense that they have been unable to reflect the important causes of             instantaneous local extinction in a turbulent flame.  As a result,              they are unlikely to provide the degree of refinement necessary for             confident numerical predictions of realistic processes such as                  turbulent combustion in the chamber of a Diesel engine where auto-              ignition and flame propagation occur at high temperatures and                   pressures.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed work program will cover three specific areas:                      1) Identification and formulation of two-dimensional models of                  laminar flamelet geometries that allow confident predictions of the             effects of curvature on the flamelet structure an the effects of                partial premixing on flamelet propagation. 2) Modification of                   existing numerical algorithms and adaptive gridding procedures that             have been developed for two-dimensional axisymmetric laminar                    diffusion flames with the goal of applying them to the study of                 problems such as the Bunsen tip and the triple point flame.                     3) Implementation of a series of experiments and calculations (with             detailed transport and finite rate chemistry) for both premixed and             nonpremixed configurations with subsequent evaluation and interpre-             tation of the data with respect to turbulent combustion models                  employing the laminar flamelet concept.  The work proposed will                 have a direct impact on turbulence models employing the laminar                 flamelet concept, on pollutant formation and on emissions control.              The research program will benefit from the combined expertise of                the U.S. and British groups in combustion modeling and advanced                 computation.",
