 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite considerable attention in the last decade by social                scientists focusing on problems of homeless persons in the United               States, many significant questions remain unanswered.  Among these are          questions related to how changes in the levels and distributions of             low-wage employment, housing, and services targeted toward the homeless         affect the location patterns and movement of people without housing.            This award will continue support from NSF for a project that is seeking         answers to these questions through an extensive analysis of the                 structural, institutional, and individual factors that affect the               number, character, and locations of homeless persons in Los Angeles.            Newly available data sources will document how shifts in the provision          of jobs and housing have affected the abilities of certain households           to find housing.  The locational distribution of homeless shelters and          services will also be analyzed.                                                      This project will continue a valuable line of inquiry into the             location and dynamics of a segment of the population that has been              increasingly in the public attention.  The empirical research will be           valuable to those seeking descriptions of the number and circumstances          of homeless populations, both in Los Angeles and elsewhere.  The                project's real value lies in its development of a fuller and more               articulate theory of contemporary urban processes, with significant             ramifications for population, social, and economic systems.  Because a          number of graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in this          project (the latter because of a Research Experiences for                       Undergraduates supplement), the project also will provide a valuable            opportunity for young scholars to involve themselves directly in basic          social scientific research.",
