 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Excellence in Education will initiate a six-week                 multidisciplinary residential Young Scholars project for 52 students in         grades 10-12.  The Research Science Institute (RSI), sponsored each             summer by the Center for Excellence in Education at a university on the         East Coast, nurtures 50-70 academically talented high school students to        pursue careers in science and mathematics, and will be offered to more          students in 1990 at a West Coast university.  The six-week intensive            Institute includes one week of morning classes by leading professors of         mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology; as well as afternoon              classes of research methodology, quantitative analysis, and                     communicative skills by top high school teachers assisted by prior RSI          participants.  Humanities classes concerning the philosophical and              ethical issues of science are also included.  Four weeks are then               devoted to one-on-one research work in a laboratory setting with a              scientist in each student's respective area of interest.  During the            last week students present their papers orally to a plenary session;            final papers are published by the Center.  Alumni activities such as            recommendations to colleges and universities, summer job opportunities,         and travel to foreign countries as Junior Ambassadors of Science                continue throughout the student's undergraduate and graduate careers.",
