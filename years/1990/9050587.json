 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the United States becomes more dependent on computer systems, the            potential for damage caused by the misuse of private, personal, or              secret data stored on these systems increases significantly.  As a              result, it is important that the future generation of computer                  professionals be trained to understand their ethical and moral                  responsibilities in dealing with the information with which they have           been entrusted.  In addition, they need to be equipped with the                 knowledge and tools to enable them to protect that information from             misuse.  Hence, this project develops a laboratory-based sequence in            computer security.  The two course sequence covers topics in                    professional responsibilities, data encryption, network security,               operating system security, viruses, and data base security.                                                                                                     The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
