Research will              focus on the following classes of network flow problems:                        l.  Pure single-commodity                                                       2.  Generalized (networks with gains and losses)                                3.  Nonlinear                                                                   4.  Multicommodity                                                              These problem classes span a very broad range of large-scale                    real-world applications as well as a spectrum of mathematical                   classes.  They also form a natural continuum, since parallel                    techniques developed for the first two classes of linear networks are           often relevant to the latter two classes, in which single-commodity             linear networks may arise as subproblems.  Thus, there are synergetic           relationships between these areas.  A goal of the research is to unify          and extend earlier results in parallel optimization in order to                 obtain efficient algorithms that are based on a variety of primal and           dual decomposition approaches and suited to implementations on                  multicomputer as well as multiprocessor architectures.  These methods           will be tested on large-scale test problems on the parallel systems             available locally as well as on other parallel hardware available via           Internet.",
