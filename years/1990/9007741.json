 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of jurors to deal with the complex issues involved in               contemporary civil litigation has been of increasing concern.                   There is currently no formally accepted definition of complex                   litigation nor has there been an empirical demonstration of the                 dimensions of complexity.  Further, little is known about how                   complexity may interfere with jurors' ability to reach a verdict.                                                                                               This study examines effects of evidentiary and legal complexity on              the jury decision process.  Integrating and adapting recently                   developed theoretical approaches to jury decisionmaking, the                    research aims to test an explanation-based model of decisionmaking              that suggests that jurors process evidence as a narrative                       organization of the trial data in which causal and intentional                  relations are of fundamental importance.  Decisionmakers are                    presumed to construct an intermediate memory model of the trial                 data, and this representation, not the \"raw\" evidence, guides                   interpretation of the evidence.  An experiment will be conducted                to test this story model using 864 jury eligible individuals.  The              design includes the investigation of the influence of three                     dimensions of evidence complexity: informational load (high,                    moderate, or low rate of processing); technical complexity (high                and moderate); and implicational clarity (pro plaintiff, pro                    defendant, and neutral or ambivalent).                                                                                                                          This research promises to make a major advance in jury research.                Introducing trial complexity into this line of research will have               significant theoretical and practical implications for                          understanding juror decisionmaking.  The analysis will also make                an important contribution to cognitive psychology by contributing               to our understanding of cognitive strategies for coping with                    complex judgment tasks.",
