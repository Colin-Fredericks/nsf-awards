 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past several years, the chemistry department has been                   engaged in a program to modernize its facilities and                            instrumentation.  A new organic lab has been built.  New                        instruments have been purchased including two infrared                          spectrometers, a UV-visible spectrophotometer and five computers.               The acquisition, through this project, of a NMR spectrometer was                the next logical step in the modernization program.  NMR                        spectroscopy had been taught entirely as a classroom subject at the             college.  Direct laboratory experience with the NMR added a new                 dimension to learning this difficult subject, making it vivid and               real.  Since most four-year colleges and universities provide                   laboratory experiments in NMR for sophomore organic students,                   having the NMR spectrometer provides the sophomores with an                     educational experience equivalent to that of sophomores at other                schools.  The plan for using the NMR has three parts.  At the end               of the first semester organic course, students are introduced to                the instrument via a demonstration, computer simulation, supervised             practice and, finally recording the spectrum of an unknown.  During             the second semester students use NMR spectroscopy to characterize               the products of synthetic reactions.  Finally, at the end of the                second semester, students use NMR in doing qualitative organic                  analysis.  The institution has contributed to this project in an                amount equal to the NSF funds.",
