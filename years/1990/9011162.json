 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to integrate program verification based on           Type theory into classical program verification.  This will be done by          building a wide-spectrum, partially constructive logic that includes            computational and noncomputational reasoning along with higher-order            functions, destructive operations, and assignment.  The semantics for           this logic does not dichotimize constructive and nonconstructive                reasoning but instead views them as being two poles of a continuum,             with the partially constructive verified programs interesting to                computer scientists in between.  The logic will be implemented and              test programs will be written for it.                                                                                                                           This new logic will be an advance over the logics currently                     available for program verification:  it will be powerful enough and             flexible enough to support constructive reasoning over functional and           imperative programs, using one common syntax and semantics.  Programs           written with the logic will be efficient and concise.  In addition,             the existence of such a logic can be used to claim that constructive            and classical verification, often thought to be inherently                      incompatible, are actually related parts of a larger whole.",
