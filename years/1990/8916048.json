 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robertson River Suite (RRS, a.k.a. Robertson River                     Formation) encompasses a series of metaluminous to peralkaline                  granitoids and felsites exposed within the core of the Blue Ridge               anticlinorium (BRA) in northern and central Virginia.  Broad-                   scale reconnaissance mapping by previous workers has established                that the RRS is intrusive into Grenville age (1.0-1.1 G.a.)                     gneisses and is intruded by numerous greenstone dikes, some of                  which may have served as feeders to the Catoctin metavolcanics of               the BRA cover sequence.  The age of the RRS is thus only broadly                constrained by field evidence as younger than Grenvillian                       metamorphism and older than at least most of the late                           Precambrian Catoctin Formation.  Previous attempts using                        radiometric techniques to determine a more exact timing for                     emplacement of the suite have produced mutually contradictory                   data spanning the range 730 to 570 M.a.  Much of the reason for                 these inconsistent data lies in the fact that these studies have                either 1) assumed the formation to be homogeneous, and thus                     accurately characterized by multiple samples collected from                     throughout the outcrop belt, or 2) acknowledged the apparent                    heterogeneity of the suite and nevertheless attempted to                        extrapolate data from one location to the entire body.  Neither                 approach is appropriate, however, in light of new evidence from                 more detailed field, petrologic, and geochemical studies recently               completed in the northern portion of the suite by this research                 group.  These data demonstrate that the RRS encompasses a series                of distinct plutons that records an obviously complex                           petrogenetic history spanning a time interval which may have been               considerable.  This study proposes to build on this work by 1)                  completing 1:24,000-scale mapping of the southern portion of the                suite, 2) using petrologic and geochemical data to define the                   nature of the constituent plutons, and 3) obtaining precise and                 accurate isotopic data bearing on the timing and duration of RRS                emplacement.  Furthermore, the petrochemical and isotopic data to               be obtained in this study will be applied to refine models for                  the petrogenetic evolution of this compositionally distinctive                  suite and the isotopic characteristics of probable source                       regions.  In summary, the results of this stud will 1) provide a                firm foundation for appropriate petrogenetic models concerning                  emplacement of this anorogenic suite, 2) place important                        constraints on the maximum age of prelapetan rifting, 3)                        establish a database on which to evaluate the relationship of                   this plutonism to the voluminous felsic lavas included within                   the Catoctin Formation and felsic intrusives of similar (?) age                 and composition occurring elsewhere in the central Appalachians,                4) define specific isotopic characteristics of the source areas                 of magma generation, and 5) lead to the development of                          geologically reasonable models concerning the petrogenetic                      evolution of such compositionally unique anorogenic suites.",
