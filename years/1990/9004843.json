 "awd_abstract_narration": "Debris flows pose a hazard to lives and structures in mountain                  communities throughout the world.  Motivated by the need to                     enhance prediction and mitigation, research projects,                           particularly in the U.S. and Japan, have produced wealth of                     information on initiation and dynamics of debris flows.  By                     comparison, little research has been devoted to understanding                   debris flows in the environment where their hazard potential is                 most serious: i.e., on debris-flow fans.  Debris-flow fans form a               significant portion of the landscape and aside from concerns                    about hazards, the dearth of rigorous studies of the processes                  forming debris-flow fans represents a basic lack of scientific                  knowledge about a major landform of Earth's surface.  The                       proposed research will address the mechanics of formation of                    debris-flow fans.  The study complements on-going debris-flow                   monitoring programs in this country and in East Asia in that we                 will develop a methodology for interpreting the vast amounts of                 information on debris flows and fan formation stored in the                     debris-flow deposits themselves.  Our approach considers the                    processes of, and controls on, debris-flow initiation,                          conveyance, and interaction with the channels of the fan surface,               starting with the lithologic and climatic conditions in the                     source area and their influence on flow mobility, volume, and                   frequency of occurrence.  The approach is a general one,                        applicable in a range of environments, and not limited to the                   specific conditions in the chosen field study site: Owens Valley,               CA.  The model will be built around an rheological description of               debris-flow dynamics and will be based on field and laboratory                  data.",
