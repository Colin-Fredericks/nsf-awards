 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Andrei Shleifer under the National           Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.            The objective of this program is to provide research support to the             Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.                                                                                                                                                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in the            areas of microeconomics, financial economics, and development theory.           One of the broad research questions central to his scholarly                    interests is how capital markets work.  Despite the empirical successes         of the current theory of capital markets, there are many observable             phenomena that are inconsistent with the assumptions of the theory.             Were the theory true, corporate takeovers would not take place or they          would be inconsequential, all investors would hold very similar                 portfolios, and returns on markets would be less volatile and changes           in asset prices would correspond to changes in economic fundamentals.           Dr. Shleifer's work has helped us to understand how monopolistic and            imperfectly competitive elements can be incorporated into our theories          of capital markets.  He has contributed to an explanation of the                crucial role of large shareholders in the market for corporate control          and to a model of the role of noise traders.  The research promises to          explain a great deal about speculation, volatility, and the efficiency          of capital markets.  Dr. Shleifer's work has been and will continue to          be very effective in establishing an important synergy between                  fundamental research and related problems of practical significance to          U.S. business and industry.",
