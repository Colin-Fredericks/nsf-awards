 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the                genetic control of growth and development of higher plants. The                 investigation focuses on the genetic control of morphogenesis in                the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The major objective of the                present study is to determine the specific roles of individual                  tubulin genes and tubulin isoforms in the microtubule complexes                 centrally involved in the processes of cell division and cell                   elongation that govern the morphogenesis of plant tissues and                   organs. The specific aims of the proposed investigations are 1)                 to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of expression                 of individual tubulin genes by northern blot and in situ                        hybridization experiments, 2) to localize, spatially and                        temporally, the individual tubulin isoforms in developing plant                 tissues and organs by western blot analyses and                                 immunofluorescence microscopy carried out with isoform-specific                 antibodies, 3) to use immunofluorescence microscopy and isoform-                specific antibodies to determine which isoforms are present in                  microtubule containing structures such as preprophase  bands,                   mitotic spindles, phragmoplasts, and the cortical arrays, 4) to                 identify the cis-acting sequences and trans-acting proteins and                 genes that control the tissue specific expression of Arabidopsis                tubulin genes and 5) to utilize \"overexpressed\" antisense gene                  specific sequences in transgenic plants produced by Agrobacterium               tumefaciens Ti plasmid mediated transformation to probe the                     function of individual tubulin genes.                                           %%%                                                                             Microtubules are filamentous polymers that play central roles in                several basic processes of the cells of higher organisms. In                    plant cells they are involved in cell division and cell                         expansion, processes key to plant morphogenesis. This project is                represents a detailed molecular study of the components of                      microtubules in plants.",
