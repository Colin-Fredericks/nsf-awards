 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membrane science and separations are two areas highlighted                      recently by the Amundson report as worthy of special attention                  in chemical engineering research.  The goal of this Gordon                      Conference, which has been held every other year since 1974,                    is to bring together researchers working at the leading edge                    of membrane science and technology for one week so that they                    may present the most recent research findings and discuss the                   impact of these findings on the use of membranes in separation                  methods.  In the spirit of Gordon Conference in general, we                     have organized the 1990 Synthetic Membrane Conference to allow                  considerable time for active discussion of each paper.                                                                                                          This Conference will draw participants from the fields of                       engineering, chemistry and physics for the purpose of                           discussing the most recent research progress in membrane                        science and technology.  It is important that we enable a                       significant number of graduate students to attend so that 1)                    future leaders of membrane technology are exposed to                            pioneering work done in the field; 2) the conference benefits                   from the fresh input provided by younger researchers; and 3)                    current students in the field of membrane science and                           separations are stimulated toward a research career and                         possibly toward a faculty position.",
