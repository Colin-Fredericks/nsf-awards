 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project                 between Professor Joseph B. Lambert, Department of Chemistry,                   Northwestern University, and Professor Takeuchi Yoshito, Department             of Chemistry, The University of Tokyo.  The scientists will                     collaborate in fundamental studies of the chemistry of the element              germanium, particularly compounds containing germanium-carbon                   bonds, so-called organogermanium compounds.  Germanium is in the                same group of the periodic table of the elements as are carbon and              silicon, and its chemistry shows some similarities to those                     elements, especially silicon.  Organosilicon compounds have been                well studied in the past twenty years, and much is known about                  their structure, reactions, and practical applications.  The                    chemistry of germanium is less well developed, but the successful               results of the earlier silicon work have given rise to considerable             interest in pursuing analogous studies of this less common                      element.  Professors Lambert and Yoshito have independently                     pursued programs of study of germanium chemistry, and plan now to               cooperate in a joint investigation of several organogermanium                   compounds especially selected for their potential in leading to a               basic understanding of the bonding in these molecules.  The                     scientists bring both similar as well as complementary expertise                and facilities to the joint project.  Some of the chemical                      syntheses of the substances under investigation will be carried                 out by the Tokyo group, and others by the Northwestern researchers.             Experimental techniques to be used in this examination include                  those of chemical kinetics as well as nuclear magnetic resonance,               electron spin resonance, and ultraviolet photoelectron                          spectroscopies.  Associated theoretical calculations will also be               carried out.                                                                                                                                                    The basic chemical information sought in this cooperative study is              expected to lay some of the important ground work needed for the                development of later practical applications of germanium chemistry,             possibly in chemical synthesis, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and               other areas.  The project brings together two research groups                   with considerable experience in this field.  By collaborating, the              scientists expect to enhance their individual programs, and thus                our knowledge of the chemistry of germanium, significantly.",
