This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple.                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. David Pimentel                       will support a six-and-one-half month-post-doctoral research                    visit to the United Kingdom by Dr. Martha S. Hunter to work                     with Dr. H.C.J. Godfray at the Imperial College at Silwood                      Park, on \"Foraging and Sex Allocation Behavior of An                            Autoparasitoid in A Spatially-Structured Host Environment.\"                     Parasitic wasps called \"autoparasitoids\" offer a unique                         opportunity to test Fisher's (1930) theory on the evolution                     of the sex ratio.  Fisher's principle that organisms should                     invest equally in each sex generally leads to a 1:1 sex                         ratio.  In autoparasitoids, however, males and females are                      laid in different hosts; thus the \"cost\" of each sex and the                    predicted sex ratio varies with the changing host environment.                  At high total host densities, wasps should be egg-limited,                      and prefer to oviposit in the less abundant host type, thus                     producing a sex ratio which is close to 1:1.  At low host                       densities, wasps should be host-limited and simply oviposit                     in hosts as they encounter them, thus producing a sex ratio                     which reflects the relative abundance of the two host types.                    The investigator proposes to test this extension of Fisher's                    theory with the autoparasitoid Encarsia tricolor in a                           spatially structured host environment.  In particular, she                      will evaluate the effects of the relative availability of the                   two host types, total host density, and spatial structure of                    the host population on sex ratio.  Since sex allocation is                      central in determining the population dynamics of autoparasi-                   toids, this research will help bridge the gap between sex                       ratio theory and population dynamics, and will contribute to                    evaluating autoparasitoid species as biological control agents.                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
