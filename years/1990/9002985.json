 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full-time award enables a physicist who directs the              Carleton College Technology Policy Project to develop his                       understanding of the relationships between access to information                and new information technologies and political power and influence.             He will spend a year at the University of California at San Diego,              working with two host scholars.  Political scientist Sanford Lakoff             studies the interaction of science and government; Herbert York,                director emeritus of the Institute on Global Conflict and                       Cooperation, is an experienced government servant and international             negotiator on arms control and other technology/society issues.                 Professor Lakoff will guide Professor Casper's study and analysis               of concepts in democratic theory such as \"political accountability\"             and \"public right to know,\" and consideration of how such concepts              might be operationalized.  Professor York will guide his study and              analysis of how scientists have both empowered and legitimated, and             disempowered and delegitimated citizen involvement.  The project                will place particular emphasis on important new roles for colleges              and universities in providing citizens access to information and                expertise.  Among the concrete products of the project will be a                series of articles and a book, tentatively titled Experts,                      Information and Political Empowerment.                                                                                                                          This project addresses a central issue in ethics and values                     studies:  the social values and mutual obligations and                          responsibilities that arise in the interactions between scientists,             engineers, and citizens.  The investigator and his host specialists             and host institution are uniquely well-qualified to undertake and               support this project; research and related activities are likely                to continue after the period of the award.  Results are likely to               be appropriately disseminated and useful.  An award in the amount               ofd $43,000 is therefore recommended.",
