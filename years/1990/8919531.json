 "awd_abstract_narration": "In nature, young rhesus monkey females are integrated for life                  into their natal group, whereas males transfer during puberty.                  The social position that young females attain in their group                    depends very much on that of their mother.  When adult, a                       female's place in the rank-order is usually at about the same                   level as that of her mother and sisters.  There are strong                      indications that this inheritance of status is mainly a social                  (as opposed to genetic) process, brought about by the young                     female's association with her kin.  Not only a young female's                   future rank, but also her future friends in the group are to some               extent predictable; she will form bonds with other females of her               age and status level, both kin and nonkin.                                                                                                                      Whereas these outcomes of social development are now fairly well                known, the details of the process are not.  There are many ways                 in which mothers, actively or passively, may guide their                        daughters' development, for example, by supporting them against                 particular opponents, by bringing them into contact with the                    offspring of their kin and friends, or by preventing the                        development of certain other contacts.  The purpose of this                     research project is to continue an investigation of the way                     rhesus mothers shape the social environment of their daughters.                 Data will be collected on a wide range of behaviors of young                    monkeys and their mothers in two large groups.  For the first                   time, social development will be followed over the entire                       developmental period, from birth to adulthood, in order to                      investigate the extent to which social interactions at early                    stages of development predict relationships formed at later                     stages.                                                                                                                                                         Because this project considers socially positive behaviors (e.g.,               bonding, social tolerance) along with socially disruptive                       behaviors (e.g., aggression, rank acquisition), the study may be                able to integrate these behaviors into a single theoretical model               of social relationships.",
