 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been difficult to develop robust, adaptive, goal-                        directed robotic behaviors based on sensory inputs, and to                      reprogramm robotic systems to carry out new tasks.  This study                  will develop a hybrid control system that merges a knowledge-                   based control architecture with trainable neural-network modules.               The control structure will handle task control and data                         management while the neural-net modules process sensor data and                 control actuator servos.  Research will characterize                            relationships between network parameters and storable function                  types, speed of training, accuracy, and time delay effects;                     define boundaries between neural processing and more conventional               task representation; and define methods of extracting model                     descriptions from trained neural nets.  Demonstration tasks                     employing hardware implementations will be used to validate                     results.  A prototype of a testbed hybrid control system is                     planned for Phase II, with Phase III development of the testbed                 into a low-cost, trainable, PC-based tool set to allow fast                     programming specification of complex sensorimotor tasks.",
