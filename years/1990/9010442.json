 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an investigation of the phenomena of freezing                  and melting of ice on a cold tube bundle.  The tube bank is                     immersed in a flowing stream of water (T    OoC) and the ice                    layer is studied that grows on the outside surface of the                       tubes, when the tubes are internally cooled below the freezing                  temperature (Tw   OoC).  The subsequent melting process of the                  ice formations when the coolant is removed will also be                         studied.                                                                                                                                                        The main focus of this research is to document in terms of new                  correlations, the time-dependent heat transfer (Nusselt                         number) and fluid flow (pressure drop) characteristics (per                     row) of the systems as the freezing and melting process                         proceeds.  We will photographically record, at various times,                   the exact ice shape profiles and will visualize the resulting                   flow field through the tube bank.  Under the steady state                       condition, the local Nusselt number distribution will be                        obtained.  Experiments will be conducted in the low to                          moderate Reynolds number range and for a number of different                    cooling temperature ratios.  Both in-line and staggered tube                    geometries will be considered.  The effect of the tube's pitch                  and the upstream turbulence level will be documented.                           The interest in this research is justified from both a                          practical and from a fundamental view-point.  The results of                    the proposed study is important to the field of thermal energy                  storage involving phase change materials.  To be more                           specific, the findings obtained in this study would have                        direct engineering consequence in the design of ice storage                     systems and in phase change storage heat exchangers.  From the                  broader perspective, the problem under investigation is a                       highly complex coupled phase change heat transfer and fluid                     dynamic problem that addresses new areas in which our current                   understanding is lacking and needs improvement.",
