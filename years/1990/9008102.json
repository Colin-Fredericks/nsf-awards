 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Feldman will continue his research in ergodic                    theory with the following areas singled out for attention:                      (i) the extension of some of the ideas of equivalence of systems                from the situation where the group which is acting is the                       integers or the reals to the case where the group is only assumed               to be amenable, (ii) geodesic flows on smooth manifolds, and                    (iii) subrelations of ergodic equivalence relations.                                 Research in ergodic theory involves trying to understand                   the average behavior of systems whose dynamics is too complicated               or chaotic to be followed in microscopic detail.  Under the                     heading \"dynamics\" can be placed the modern theory of how groups                of abstract transformations act on smooth spaces.  Another                      important theme in ergodic theory is the classification of                      systems into broad categories which are mathematically identical                in an abstract sense.  Professor Feldman's research will make                   contact with these areas.",
