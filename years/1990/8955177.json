 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES)                     offers a three-year program to enhance the mathematics and                      science knowledge base as well as the teaching strategies of                    teachers of American Indian students in grades three through                    five.  As a minority among minorities, American Indians are                     underserved in mathematics and science education and thus                       underrepresented in the science professions.  Effective                         instructional strategies, responsive to the learning style and                  cultural values of Indian students, need to be implemented.                     This project will provide a large step toward accomplishing                     that objective.                                                                                                                                                 Twenty four elementary teachers from eight schools will be                      selectively recruited from regions of northern New Mexico and                   northern Arizona that serve Indian students.  Three elementary                  teachers per school plus one high school mentor, well trained                   in science and/or mathematics, from the same district, will                     participate, as a team, in a four-tiered enhancement project                    which includes a three-week summer workshop per year, monthly                   inservice sessions during the academic year at each of the                      eight participating schools, a joint two-day Leadership Seminar                 each academic year and program staff visits to the classrooms                   of the participating teachers to ensure implementation of the                   curricular material and new teaching strategies. The workshops                  are based on a previously successful model which brings                         students in during the mornings of weeks two and three.  The                    communities are committed to the education of its students and                  are bearing all the costs for the students' activities.  The                    workshop topics integrate science, mathematics and writing in a                 culturally appropriate context.  AISES has produced, with NSF                   funding, the Hands On, Minds On materials that will be used as                  the basis for the science activities.                                                                                                                           The staff for the project draws heavily on American Indian                      scientists, mathematicians and educators, thus providing role                   models for both teachers and their students.                                                                                                                    Cost-sharing from the communities being served is equivalent to                 6% of the NSF request. ***//",
