 "awd_abstract_narration": "This application is for partial funding of a conference on                      Chromosome Replication and Segregation in Yeast to be held under                the auspices of the Federation of American Societies of                         Experimental Biology (FASEB) from August 5-10, 1990 at the                      Vermont Academy, Saxton's River, Vermont.  Participation in the                 meeting will be limited to 155 scientists who will be chosen from               applicants on the basis of their expertise and interests as being               the most likely to help create a stimulating and informative                    meeting.  The topic of the meeting emphasizes research on the                   chromosome replication and segregation in yeast.  While most                    participants will use baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as               an experimental system, scientists using other filamentous fungi                will be encouraged to participate.  The conference will consist                 of nine scientific sessions, each with approximately 9 speakers;                in addition, one or two afternoons will be devoted to poster                    sessions and/ or informal group discussions.  Approximately half                of the speakers from each session will be invited in advanced;                  the remaining half will be chosen from the pool of applicants.                  Three sessions will be devoted to DNA replication (cis elements                 and their associated factors, enzymology, and in vivo analysis of               origin usage).  Four sessions will be devoted to chromosome                     segregation (centromeres and their associated factors, the                      mitotic apparatus, nuclear architecture  and new  mutational                    approaches to chromosome transmission).  The last two sessions                  will be devoted to the analysis of the coordination of chromosome               replication and segregation during the cell cycle.  This meeting                will fill an important niche for scientists interested in yeast                 chromosome replication and segregation by allowing extensive                    communication between laboratories at the important time this                   rapidly developing field.",
