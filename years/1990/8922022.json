 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society                    supports research that examines the intellectual and value contexts             that govern the development and use of science and technology.                  Through case studies in the neurosciences, set against a background             of quantitative information, this project will explore the                      relationship between autonomy and power in the sciences.  The                   research asks, \"How have the neurosciences managed to anchor                    themselves organizationally in the world of science?  How much                  autonomy have they achieved, and on what basis?\"  It will explore               the utility of the concepts of enrollment, trust, and legitimation              in accounting for the rapid institutional expansion of the                      neurosciences during the period 1965-1985.  This development can                be seen as a movement, a broad, loose coalition of researchers from             a number of areas that has become increasingly anchored in the                  organizations where science finds its resources -- professional                 societies, designated funding programs, institutes and departments.             The research -- based on comparative case studies of the                        development of professional societies, government funding programs,             and successful and unsuccessful departments -- will both document               the evolution of the field and identify political, economic and                 social factors contributing to that emergence.  It will also                    contribute to our understanding and assessment of theory underlying             the political sociology of science.  Outcomes will include journal              articles, scholarly monographs or chapters, and presentations at                professional society meetings and in government agencies that                   support neuroscience research.                                                                                                                                  Questions of how goals get set and legitimated in the sciences are              central to research in science, technology and society studies.                 A highly qualified young investigator at an appropriate institution             proposes to address this question, by studying developments in a                fast moving and intrinsically interesting scientific field.  The                research promises to contribute to our understanding of its                     development and of scientific progress more broadly.  The research              methods are appropriate; results are likely to be accessible and                significant to a broad audience.  Support is highly recommended.",
