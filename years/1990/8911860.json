 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the vast growth of the chemical sciences and industries                 over the past century and a half, and the profound transformations              they have wrought in the world, their modern history is little                  understood.  This grant supports a three-day conference of                      historians of the chemical sciences, together with historians and               social scientists in related fields, chemical scientists,                       secondary school chemistry teachers, and others concerned with                  science education, to explore issues and challenges facing the                  historian of modern chemical sciences and technologies.  This is                the first conference to be devoted to this research area.                                                                                                       The conference is taking place in May, 1990 and has three                       objectives:  1) presentation and interactive discussion of \"cutting             edge\" research in cognitive, institutional, social and                          technological history;  2) discussion of documentation strategy for             recent and contemporary chemical sciences; and 3) consideration of              \"public\" communication with historians, chemical scientists,                    educators and science writers.  A special feature of this grant is              the provision for funds to bring ten secondary school chemistry                 teachers to the conference in order for them to participate in the              discussions aimed at accomplishing these objectives.  The                       conference papers, commentaries and discussion are being published.             The volume should provide a benchmark for historians and chemical               scientists, and for those working to promote the public                         understanding of science.",
