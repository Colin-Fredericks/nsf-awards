 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic relationships in natural populations of animals and                plants are a basic issue in evolutionary biology.  Traditional                  techniques used to study natural populations have often been                    found inadequate for describing the true genetic variability of                 populations and the genetic relationships between populations.                  In the proposed research, the recently developed technique of DNA               fingerprinting will be used to investigate the genetic                          relationships between natural populations of Poecilia latipinna,                a small fish occurring along the coastline of the Southeastern                  U.S.  This fish has been partially genetically characterized                    using other techniques.  Data suggest that populations of this                  species may be more genetically distinct than heretofore                        determined.  DNA fingerprinting should reveal a greater level of                differentiation between populations of this fish than has yet                   been demonstrated.  If so, DNA fingerprinting could be a                        potential tool for other population genetic studies of both a                   basic and applied nature.  If DNA fingerprinting can be shown to                be a useful tool for describing natural populations, evolutionary               biologists and managers of natural populations will have                        available to them a relatively simple technique with greater                    power for detecting genetic relationships than any method                       previously used.",
