 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants often synthesize antibiotic compounds (phytoalexins) in                  response to infection, and considerable effort is currently being               devoted to research on regulation of their biosynthesis.  This                  research examines some of the terminal, phytoalexin-specific                    reactions in the biosynthetic pathway for the pea phytoalexins,                 (+)pisatin and (-)maackiain.  The isoflavone reductase which                    produces the first chiral intermediate of the pathway has been                  purified and is being characterized.  Other enzymes to be studied               are pterocarpan synthase, which performs the terminal step of                   maackiain synthesis, and 6'-deoxychalcone synthase, the first                   enzyme of the stress-induced branch of the flavonoid pathway.                   The penultimate step in pisatin synthesis was previously thought                to be an oxygenase reaction, but this hypothesis is not                         consistent with recent findings.  Work to be done on this project               to resolve this question includes labeling experiments in vivo                  and enzyme studies.  Antibodies against the purified enzymes are                being used to obtain corresponding cDNA clones.  This approach                  provides information about how the specificities of the pathway                 enzymes determine and chemical diversity that exists among legume               phytoalexins.  Cloned genes for these enzymes can eventually                    allow further evalation of the role of phytoalexins in disease                  resistance by modifying the phytoalexin complement of transgenic                plants.                                                                                                                                                         It is well-established that many plant species synthesize                       phytoalexins in response to infection by pathogens.  It is often                proposed that the production of these antimicrobial compounds                   respresents an active mechanism of defense against potential                    pathogens.  However, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis                 has been difficult to obtain.  Recent work carried out with pea                 plants and a fungus that causes disease in pea argues that                      phytoalexins can play an important role in the determination of                 plant resistance.  The goal of this reaearch is to examine                      phytoalexin biosynthesis in pea.  Such findings are useful in                   addressing interesting questions concerning the regulation of the               biosynthetic pathway and the role of phytoalexins in disease                    resistance.  Future implications of this work are novel                         strategies for enhancing the effectiveness of the phytoalexin                   defense response.",
