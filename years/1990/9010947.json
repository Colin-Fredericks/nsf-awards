 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique drop-tube experimental apparatus to promote                            spherically-symmetric evaporation and combustion of freely-                     falling droplets will be developed and constructed.  The                        design of the apparatus is based upon the principle that                        gravitationally-induced pressure gradients in gases may be                      significantly reduced by accelerating the gases with properly                   contoured tubes.  Droplets traveling with the gases will                        experience greatly reduced buoyancy and forced convection                       environments, thereby promoting spherical symmetry.  The                        apparatus will be used to study nearly spherically-symmetrical                  droplet evaporation and combustion under conditions that have                   heretofore not been experimentally achieved (i.e., combustion                   of droplets initially = 100 um in diameter at atmospheric                       pressure).  Experimental studies will focus on  1. combustion                   and extinction of hydrocarbon droplets,  2. measurements of                     transient droplet and flame diameters, and  3. combustion and                   disruption of droplets with strong sooting tendencies.                                                                                                          The proposed facility will allow many fundamental and                           practical droplet combustion and evaporation phenomena to be                    studied under conditions previously unattained.  The data                       obtained will be useful for testing existing theories, and                      will provide fundamental information on phenomena such as                       extinction conditions, transient vaporization rates, and                        transient flame growth.  Results from the work will be useful                   to the scientific community (from the fundamental information                   gained), and also to the combustion and spray communities in                    general, possibly allowing improved practical combustion                        devices to be developed.",
