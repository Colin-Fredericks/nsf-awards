 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary concern of the Elizabeth City State University                 and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science is the                   production of quality graduates in the mathematical sciences at                 the undergraduate level.  Thus, all of the efforts of the                       department must be designed to advance and be supportive of this                concern.                                                                             The first goal is to increase the percentage of our students               (at the upper division: junior-senior level), involved in                       research and/or practical experiences, to the seventy-five                      percent level over the next five years.  This will require                      enhancing faculty research activities and emphasizing the value                 of research.                                                                         A second goal is to modify the current program of study (a                 B.S. degree in Computer and Information Sciences) in one or two                 ways: either develop two distinct curriculum tracks:  one in                    computer science (scientific applications) and one in information               science (business application) or modify the current program of                 study to be one in computer science only.                                            A third goal is that of developing the current computer                    science program to the extent that the program will be accredited               by CSAB of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) during                  the next five years.                                                                 A fourth goal over the next five years is to modify the                    operation of the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science                 so that the  computer science faculty will operate as a cohesive                group, devoting their primary efforts to teaching, research and                 other activities relating primarily to the Computer Science                     Program.                                                                             A fifth goal is that of increasing the percentage of their                 graduates who will go to graduate school; currently about ten                   percent go.  Over the next five years they plan to increase that                number to twenty five percent.                                                       To accomplish the goals outlined the following activities                  are  envisioned.                                                                     A. An expansion and improvement of the research/practicum                  activities of their majors by the development of new linkages                   with industry, government and other universities.                                    B.  A review and modification of the curriculum offering in                the computer science program to assure that courses exist at                    State-of-the-Arts levels and meet ACM accreditation standards.                       C.  An enhancement and an expansion of current computer                    resources, including hardware, software and firmware; as well as                library publications in computer science;                                            D.  An enhancement and expansion of faculty development                    activities, with emphasis on research involvement and learning                  new instructional strategies/teaching methodologies;                                 E.  A review and modification of the entrance, progression                 and exit requirements of majors in computer science.",
