They will work                  under the direction of two faculty advisors on mathematical                     problems concerned with inverse conductivity.  The prototype of                 such problems is that of finding electrical conductivity of a                   body knowing only the surface voltages and currents.  The                       discrete (and very difficult) analogue of this problem occurs                   when one replaces the conducting medium with a network of                       resistors.  If the boundary current is known, then an algorithm                 exists which determines the resistances.                                             One of the problems the students will work on is that of                   determining the boundary current from the potential.  With that,                they will go on to consider questions such as determining the                   size of the largest network for which the algorithm works, the                  detection of resistors of zero or infinite conductivity.  In                    addition, work will be done in an effort to determine the shape                 of the region from surface currents, in estimating the degree of                approximation one gets by replacing continuous media by a                       discrete network.  Many other related problems will arise                       naturally which will provide realistic challenges to the students               while assisting the senior investigators with their on-going                    research programs.",
