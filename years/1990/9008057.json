The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Linda A. Strausbaugh                 will support a 12-month postdoctoral research visit by Dr.                      Gregory K. Hampikian of the University of Connecticut to work                   with Dr. Jennifer M. Graves of La Trobe University, Bundoora,                   Victoria, AusPtralia, on \"Mammalian Y-Chromosome Evolution                      and Sex Determination:  A Marsupial Approach.\"  The predominant                 theory of mammalian Y chromosome evolution predicts that the                    only Y genes conserved are those involved in sex determination,                 male-specific traits, and X-Y pairing.  Marsupials (infraclass                  Metatheria) diverged from placental animals (infra class                        Eutheria) at least 130 million years ago.  The researchers                      propose to isolate genes conserved between the infraclasses                     from a marsupial Y-specific library in order to detail the                      general plan of mammalian sex determination and shed light on                   the evolution of sex chromosomes.  The marsupial Y is ideal                     for these comparative studies because its small size (2-3 X                     1,000,000 bases) facilitates library construction and its                       lack of an X chromosome pairing region simplifies characteri-                   zation.                                                                                                                                                         The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
