 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very little work has been done on the nature of program                    equivalence for typed higher-order languages with imperative features.          In this project, investigations will continue into reasoning about              programs with side-effects and other imperative features such as                control abstractions.  In particular, the semantics of various typed            lambda calculi with references or pointers will be investigated.                Simple types will be studied initially and a variety of extensions              including polymorphism, effect systems, and control abstractions will           then be explored.  One aim of the research is to develop calculi of             constrained equivalence which take into consideration the fact that a           program or expression will only be used in certain contexts.  In                addition, the problem of providing for object-oriented programming in           typed languages will be studied.  This includes specifying classes of           objects and defining notions of equivalence for objects and                     specifications of classes.                                                                                                                                           This work can be seen from two points of view.  First as studying          typed fragments of untyped languages, axiomatizing program equivalence          relative to a set of typed contexts and developing formal mechanisms            for embedding typed fragments in untyped languages.  Second as adding           reference types and other imperative features and studying the effect           of these additions on various type systems and on the nature of                 program equivalence.",
