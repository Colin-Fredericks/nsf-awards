Kriedemann of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial                 Research Organization) Division of Forestry and Forest                          products.  This research is to investigate the basis of low                     photosynthesis rates in citrus leaves, through correlation                      of the carbon dioxide concentration of these leaves with                        their structure.  A primary focus is to determine the                           importance of diffusive resistances, primarily through the                      cell wall, to the rate of photosynthetic uptake of carbon                       dioxide.                                                                                                                                                        The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      Australian group and its development of techniques for                          studying biophysical limitations of plants and the Syvertsen                    work on the biochemical limitations of photosynthesis of                        citrus, as compared with other species.  This is important                      fundamental work in plant metabolism, as well as having                         potential for major advances in improving the productivity of                   major agricultural crops in both countries.",
