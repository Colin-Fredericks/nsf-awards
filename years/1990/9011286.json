 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post-event investigation project to learn                             engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                    1989).                                                                                                                                                          The design criteria and instrumented response of three San                      Francisco Bay Area structures will be studied in this project.                  Located in San Francisco, Emeryville, and San Jose,                             California, respectively, each of the three buildings was                       designed for lateral forces greater than those required by the                  governing codes.  Furthermore, none of the three structures                     incurred significant damage during the earthquake.  The design                  criteria for all three buildings was developed by URS/John A.                   Blume & Associates, Engineers of San Francisco.  The objective                  of the research is two-fold.  First, to assess the adequacy                     of code lateral force provisions for the design of buildings                    in regions of high seismicity and to determine the advantages                   of using more rigorously developed design criteria.  The                        second is to construct computer models of the three predicted                   with measured response.  Through this study the use of complex                  finite element codes for the purpose of dynamic structural                      analysis will be verified and the opportunity for system                        identification studies of the three subject structures will                     be presented.                                                                                                                                                   The research will provide a rational assessment of the                          effectiveness of rigorous design requirements through a                         comparison of demand and capacity resulting from code level                     forces, specified design forces, and the actual forces                          developed in the earthquake.",
