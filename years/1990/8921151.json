 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in avian                         behavioral ecology between Dr. William Searcy, University of                    Pittsburgh and Dr. Arne Lundberg, Department of Zoology,                        Uppsala University, Sweden.  The objective of the proposed                      research is the collection and analysis of critical field                       data on the well-studied polyterritorial and polygynous pied                    flycatcher.                                                                                                                                                     The investigators propose to examine the adaptive basis of                      polygyny in this species, in which polygyny is closely                          associated with the defense of multiple territories by single                   males (polyterritoriality).  Female pied flycatchers pay a                      fitness cost if they choose an already-mated male, and they                     are not compensated for this cost by receiving a better                         territory or mate.  One current hypothesis on why females                       nevertheless do mate polygynously is that the polyterritorial                   system allows males to deceive females about their mating                       status.  A second hypothesis is that females choose mated                       males despite being aware of the male's true mating status,                     because of the high cost of continuing to search for an                         unmated male.  The investigators plan to test the first                         hypothesis by determining whether there are reliable                            differences in behavior between mated and unmated males                         during periods when unmated females are observing them.  If                     such differences exist, females ought to be able to determine                   male mating status.  The second hypothesis will be tested by                    determining whether females that ultimately settle with mated                   males have previously encountered unmated males.  Both tests                    will be performed by following the mate search of individually                  marked females forced to search for new mates by the removal                    of their previous mate and nestbox. The project will benefit                    from the combined experimental expertise of Dr. Searcy and                      Dr. Lundberg's record of productive field work with this                        species.  The results of this research will make an important                   contribution to the field of behavioral ecology.",
