 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Kleiber, Stwalley, and Sando are supported by the                    Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in a collaborative                      experimental and theoretical investigation of far-wing laser                    absorption leading to chemical reaction and various inelastic                   processes in alkali metal interactions with hydrogen molecules.                 The far wing absorption technique is one way in which to probe                  directly the properties of the usually very short-lived                         intermediate or transition region between reactants and                         products in a chemical transformation.                                                                                                                          A laser tuned slightly off-resonance from an allowed or a                       forbidden atomic transition of an alkali metal is being used to                 pump colliding alkali-hydrogen \"intermediates\" at distances                     suitable for resonant absorption of the off-resonance photon.                   The subsequent branching into various product channels is                       monitored, as a function of the amount of laser detuning, by                    either emission measurements or laser-induced fluorescence.  Of                 particular interest are reactions dynamics near threshold and                   the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the dynamics.                           Theoretical treatments are emphasizing approximate classical                    path methods that include the full motion of the nuclei.                        Extensions and generalizations of semiclassical line-broadening                 theories are being explored.",
