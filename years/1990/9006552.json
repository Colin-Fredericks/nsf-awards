 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project describes the production and preliminary                           characterization of mutants bearing lesions in the extrinsic loop               region of CPal in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803.  CPal                  (encoded by the psbB gene) is an intrinsic membrane protein which               is an integral component of the photosynthetic apparatus of                     cyanobacteria and higher plants and appears to be required for                  photosynthetic oxygen evolution in Photosystem II.  The goal of                 this project is to determine the function of the large and                      unusual extrinsic loop region of this protein.  This region                     appears to  interact with the extrinsic 33 kDa protein and                      possibly the inorganic cofactors manganese, chloride, or calcium,               of all of which are required for oxygen evolution.  Additionally,               CPal appears to act as a chlorophyll-a antenna for Photosystem                  II.  The extrinsic loop region may interact with other antennae                 proteins and/or the Photosystem II reaction center.  In vitro                   mutagenesis (saturation and oligonucleotide-mediated site-                      directed) will be used to produce mutations in the extrinsic loop               region.  These mutations will be re-introduced into Synechocystis               (along with a closely linked antibiotic resistance marker), and                 mutants will be isolated by a combination of screening for                      antibiotic resistance and loss of photoautotrophic growth.                      Additionally, screening for antibiotic resistance and loss of                   photoautotrophic growth.  Additionally, screening for temperature               sensitive  mutations will be performed.  These mutations will                   then be characterized by examination of their electron transport                activity 77oK fluorescence emission spectra, manganese and                      calcium content of Photosystem II-enriched preparations,                        photosynthetic membrane protein composition, and their chloride                 requirements for the stabilization of manganese.",
