 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the theoretical foundations of databases are                    being investigated through the use of discrete mathematics.                     Research is conducted toward two major subgoals, i.e. to:                                                                                                       (1) Find conceptually simple set-theoretic and/or algebraic                     models of database issues and practices, especially those                       associated with the relational database model. Examples of such                 models are those for object histories, spreadsheets, sequential-                data query languages, and nested relations. Such models are in                  contrast with the familiar logical and programming language                     models.                                                                                                                                                         (2) Use these models to address significant questions of                        database studies and possibly in other areas of computer science                interest. Such questions are being suggested by either (a) the                  underlying database physical situation and design methodologies                 or (b) analytic considerations and the underlying mathematical                  formalism.                                                                                                                                                      Results of this research are expected to formulate a better                     understanding of current database concerns, as well as provide                  tools for examining and solving database management problems. For               example, one line of activity is addressing the fundamental                     problem of data restructuring, i.e., what does it mean, how can                 it be accomplished, and what are the fundamental laws related to                it.",
