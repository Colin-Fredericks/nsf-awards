 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research radars have proven to be an extremely useful tools                 for a broad range of meteorological topics.  Such research has                  encompassed studies of the precipitation producing                              characteristics of individual clouds, to investigations of severe               thunderstorms, to sampling of vertical wind structure for study                 of large scale weather patterns, to the analysis of global water                budgets.  Major practical applications of meteorological radar                  include the capability of accurate remote sensing of rainfall for               hydrological purposes and remote detection of severe weather such               as tornadoes, flash floods, hurricanes and microbursts.  Indeed,                the benefits of these practical applications are the primary                    reason for fundamental changes in the Nation's weather observing                system via installation of the next generation of meteorological                radars (NEXRAD) and vertical wind sounding systems (profilers).                     There is a need to continue state-of-the-art research in                    meteorological radar and to train the next generation of both                   research and operational radar meteorologists.  This need for                   accelerated research and educational activities has been                        emphasized recently in a report issued by the American                          Meteorological Society based on a meeting focussed on assessing                 the state of radar meteorological research and education.                           Accordingly, the National Science Foundation issued a project               solicitation for management of a major radar facility in an                     educational/research setting.  The Principal Investigator of the                winning proposal has put forth an impressive plan for management                of the radar facility in support of both in-house and external                  (to the institution) educational and research activities in radar               meteorology.  These activities include interactions between                     engineers, computer scientists and meteorologists in an effort to               continue to push back the frontiers of the science and to train a               new generation of radar meteorologists and radar engineers. //",
