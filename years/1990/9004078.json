 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work undertaken in this project concerns partial                       differential equations of hyperbolic type.  These equations are                 frequently used to model wave phenomena occurring the physical                  universe.  Examples can be found in the theories of elasticity,                 elementary particle physics and general relativity.  The general                paradigm for studying a class of hyperbolic equations is to show                first the existence of what are known as weak solutions, to                     establish properties of these solutions and then examine the                    large time behavior of the solutions.  In the last context, one                 looks for stationary or static solutions through a conversion of                the (now time-independent) equation to elliptic form.                                This research will focus on nonlinear waves described by                   equations whose primary nonlinear term (as distinct from the                    fundamental wave equation) is a power of the modulus of the                     solution.  At issue is whether solutions can be shown to exist                  for all time or will singularities develop?  It turns out that a                nonlinearity equal to the fifth power of the solution is the                    critical exponent for existing theory.  For all values less than                five, regularity obtains.  Recent work provides proof of the                    regularity even at the critical value.  Current work will now be                confined to equations involving higher powers of the                            nonlinearity.  Past methods will definitely not work here.                           Other investigations will be carried out on the wave                       equation in curved space-time to determine whether the energy of                the solution decays locally in space and on Hamiltonian systems                 that are invariant under the action of a Lie group.  Analysis of                these systems will be directed toward a better understanding of                 the stability of periodic solutions.",
