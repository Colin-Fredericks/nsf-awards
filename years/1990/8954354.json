 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two week project-oriented workshop on the fundamentals of VLSI                design and CAD tool usage is being conducted.  The workshop is                  directed towards EE faculty with little experience in VLSI design, EE           faculty with expertise in VLSI, but little familiarity with the design          tools available in the academic environment, and CS faculty with                minimal acquaintance with electronics engineering.  The course is               equipping 30 faculty members with the resources necessary to conduct            undergraduate course in VLSI  to culminate in the fabrication and               subsequent test of student-designed chips.   Topics include; an                 introduction to UNIX, device behavior, design methodology, design               styles and process fundamentals.  Lectures are supplemented by design           and simulation laboratory exercises on CAD work stations.  Emphasis is          on public domain CAD tools in a UNIX environment.  Fabricated chips are         mailed to participants after the end of the workshop.                                                                                                           The participant's institutions are providing the costs of travel for            the participants amounting to about fifteen percent over the budget for         the program.//",
