 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most objects perceived visually are partly occluded by other                    objects; yet human observers accurately detect the unity and                    boundaries of objects under most circumstances.  There are other                phenomena in which boundaries are perceived in the the absence of               local visual information, such as illusory contours and some                    perceived transparency phenomena.  In all of these cases,                       perceived object boundaries are interpolated between physically-                specified edges.  This project will address the various cases of                boundary interpolation, testing and refining a recently proposed                unifying theory, and more generally attempting to specify the                   conditions under which interpolation occurs.  Specific aims                     include tests of edge interpolation in both two and three-                      dimensional displays, development of methods for generation of                  random displays, and development of a variety of measures for                   assessing boundary perception, including both perceptual report                 and non-verbal measures.  This work will have implications both                 for understanding human perception of objects and for object and                boundary detection in computer vision systems.",
