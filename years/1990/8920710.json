 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, tends to colonize newly                  disturbed land in large numbers, creating initially very dense                  populations of newly founded colonies.  As these colonies grow,                 they compete with one another through brood-stealing and                        territorial warfare.  The resulting colony mortality causes the                 population to self-thin as colonies and their territories grow.                 Large colonies expand at the expense of small ones.                                  By a combination of experimental and statistical methods,                  Dr. Tschinkel will determine how colony size differences are                    created and how they and initial colony density affect the                      density, spacing and size distribution of colonies during                       thinning.  He will also study the factors which predict growth                  and survivorship of individual colonies and the behavioral                      aspects of competition.                                                              This research will make important contributions to                         understanding population dynamics of these social insects,                      especially the importance of colony size and similarities between               ant and plant populations.  In addition, the work has practical                 implications since attempts at fire ant control or management                   have often failed because of the poor understanding of its                      population dynamics.  This study will help fill this gap and thus               improve future control strategies.",
