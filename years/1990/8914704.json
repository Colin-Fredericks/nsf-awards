 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Brent Mishler at                  Duke University, graduate student De Luna will complete a                       taxonomic study of the tropical American group of mosses of the                 family Hedwigiaceae.  Field collecting in several South American                countries will supplement collections already made by the student               from Mexico and Central America.  Laboratory culturing of the                   mosses will provide additional critical growth stages.                               The scientific study of evolutionary relationships among                   plant species has benefited from new sources of data and new                    methods of analysis.  Mosses are particularly suitable for an                   empirical evaluation of the use of developmental (growth stage)                 data in systematics.  Growth experiments under controlled                       conditions will provide data about the ontogeny and heritability                of features used in moss classification, and allow evaluation of                the variability and reliability of these characters.  The                       research will result in an improved classification of these                     tropical mosses, through the use of quantitative and cladistic                  analyses of developmental anatomy and morphology.  In turn,                     questions about their biogeographic relationships with North                    American and African forms can be addressed.",
