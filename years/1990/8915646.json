 "awd_abstract_narration": "The product development process begins with the definition                 of needs and ends with the production of a product to meet those                needs.  Through the process, many design decisions are made which               affect the ultimate configuration, appearance, and function of                  the product.  Oftentimes, these decisions are made without a                    rational basis or realistic assessment of the impact of the                     decision.  The outcome of this research project will be a                       methodology to assess the manufacturability of machined                         components and to identify areas where redesign is necessary.                   This methodology will be structured such that it can be                         implemented early in the design process and will allow the user                 to optimize the component design so that it can be efficiently                  and economically manufactured.                                                       This approach to evaluating manufacturability utilizes the                 concept of information content from the principles of axiomatic                 design.  The specific areas of research which are involved with                 developing this methodology are definition of a metric by which                 manufacturability can be measured and development of a design                   representation scheme which facilitates the evaluation of                       manufacturability.  The outcome of this work will contribute to                 the ongoing effort to establish a rational basis for design                     decisions and to the need to develop strategies which more                      closely couple the design and manufacturing activities.",
