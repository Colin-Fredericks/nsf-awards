 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective of this research is to determine how cells                  generate morphogenetic movements. The specific objective is to                  learn how deep mesodermal cells produce the autonomous narrowing                (convergence) and lengthening (extension) of the dorsal axial                   tissues of the gastrula and neurula of the anuran amphibian,                    Xenopus laevis. Previous work showed that convergence and                       extension is accomplished by active rearrangement of several                    layers of cells to form fewer layers of greater area (radial                    intercalation) and several rows of cells to form fewer rows of                  greater length and lesser width (mediolateral intercalation). The               proposed research will show how the direction of intercalation is               determined and how the motile activities of individual cells                    contribute to the process. Regions of the embryo are explanted                  into a culture system of Dr. Keller's design that allows direct                 recording and manipulation of cell behavior. Paths of cell                      movement, protrusive activity and contact behavior in normal and                microsurgically altered explants will be recorded with an optical               disc recorder after digital video image processing. Two types of                microscopy will be used: normal epi-illumination and low-light                  level fluorescence microscopy of cells labeled with DiI, a                      fluorescent lipid. These methods resolve the finest details of                  motility, which will be analyzed quantitatively and correlated                  with immunocytochemical analysis of the cytoskeleton of fixed                   explants and with cell structure seen by electron microscopy.                   Cell fates will be determined by tracing with fluorescein dextran               amine. These data will show how the paths of cell movement are                  controlled and how protrusive activity of individual cells                      results in their intercalation. Convergence and extension by cell               intercalation is an early, essential step in development of the                 dorsal axial tissues, the head, the vertebral column and central                nervous system of all vertebrates examined thus far, and thus is                a fundamental process in development. Understanding how cells                   intercalate will be a major contribution to our knowledge about                 how cells function in morphogenesis.                                            %%%                                                                             This work will provide a detailed description of the movements of               cells deep in the early developing embryo that lead to the tissue               shape changes. These ultimately cause the early foldings of the                 embryonic tissues to shape form the adult animal.",
