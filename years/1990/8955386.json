 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, Davis, will undertake a project                   to develop a one-year graduate level program for training                       physical science teachers.  The project will seek to attract                    students with a degree in the biological sciences who have a                    demonstrated competence in the mathematics and physical                         science coursework required for their degree.  There is an                      excess of individuals trained in the life sciences and a                        shortage of those qualified to teach physical science in                        California, and this project will attempt to remedy the                         imbalance.  The curriculum will be designed by scientists,                      science educators, and meritorious classroom teachers.  The                     students will receive subject matter and pedagogical training                   in physics, chemistry, and earth science during the program                     and will carry out student teaching in all three disciplines.                   California is in the process of implementing a new State                        Science Framework in which all the disciplines will be taught                   each year with instruction cutting across the disciplines.                      Since the graduates of this program will have strong                            competencies in all sciences, they will be ideally suited to                    teach in this restructured environment.  A cadre of mentor                      teachers will participate in workshops to enhance their                         subject matter and pedagogical competencies and will serve as                   supervising teachers for the participants during their field                    experience.  Transportable instructional materials will be                      developed by the project, and a dissemination conference will                   be held for those from other institutions seeking to adopt                      the program.  After the development period, the program will                    become institutionalized and a permanent offering of the                        university.  The university will cost sharing will be 24% of                    NSF's contribution.",
