 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific community has, since 1925, recognized the American               Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Rockville, Maryland, as a symbol              of top quality in providing living fungus cultures for use in                   education, research and development.  The quality and the resulting             scientific confidence have been achieved after a long, continuous               and substantial effort by scientists throughout the world.  It is               the only general service collection of living fungi (including                  yeasts) in the United States, consisting of over 23,000 strains                 representing more than 6,000 species.  During the last five years,              a total of 3,767 strains were accessioned and 35,039 cultures were              distributed.                                                                                                                                                    As a national resource center, the collection's functions include               not only the accessioning, preservation, authentication, and                    distribution of reference and type cultures, but also the creation              and manipulation of data files for each culture maintained.  It                 also acts as an information clearing house in all the disciplines               of mycology by disseminating information pertaining to the                      availability of strains, nomenclature, classification,                          characterization, preservation techniques, and applications of                  fungus cultures to the study and solution of human problems                     involving food, energy, health and environmental pollution.                                                                                                     In compliance with the ATCC constitution set forth by the Board of              Trustees, which represents over 100,000 professionals in the life               sciences, the fungal culture collection will continue to pursue the             ATCC mission of bringing into the collection all named fungal taxa              as well as strains of scientific significance to contemporary                   research, particularly to biotechnology, and enhancing the quality              of acquisitions and the efficiency of services associated with the              collection.                                                                                                                                                     This award provides a partial operational subsidy to the ATCC for               its service functions to the national and international fungal                  research community.",
