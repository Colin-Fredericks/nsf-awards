 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves Wheelock College with the Associated                      Day Care Services of Boston (ADCS), Boston Head Start, and                      Cambridge Head Start, to design, pilot, produce, and                            disseminate a comprehensive staff development program in                        early childhood physical science.  The materials produced                       will enable those individuals responsible for education                         quality in community-based, pre-school settings to provide                      staff development activities to enhance science teaching and                    learning in the classroom.  The project will also allow                         Wheelock to design and implement three institutes to train                      trainers in the use of the new program.  During the first                       year of the project the staff will work intensively with                        early childhood teachers in their classrooms and in workshop                    and seminar sessions.  As the teachers enhance their skills                     in teaching physical science and redesign their environments,                   the project staff will gather data on the nature of the                         teaching and learning and on the specific training needs of                     early childhood teachers.  Year two will be focused on the                      development of an extensive Staff Development Manual and                        accompanying training video.  During year three project staff                   will field test the materials and conduct three institutes in                   three states to train early childhood staff developers in                       their use.  Ongoing dissemination of the final products will                    occur through national and local conferences and regional day                   care and Head Start training networks.",
