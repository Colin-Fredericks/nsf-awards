 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study, experiments will be conducted to determine the                   position of the jarosite and natrojarosite stability fields as                  functions of the H2SO4-K2SO4 and H2SO4-Na2SO4 Concentration in                  the coexisting aqueous phase.  Experimental Temperatures will                   range from 200oC to the upper stability limit of jarosite and                   natrojarosite, which is expected to be below 450oC.  In addition,               the partitioning of sodium and potassium between jarosite and                   aqueous sulfate solutions, the D fractionation between the                      hydroxyl sites of jarosite and water, and 18O fractionation                     between the jarosite hydroxyl and sulfate sites and water will be               measured.  These experiments, which will be conducted in standard               cold-seal hydrothermal vessels at a pressure of 500 bars, are an                extension of work in progress on alunite to a ferric-iron bearing               system.  They should improve our ability to interpret isotope                   data on acid-sulfate alteration, which frequently includes both                 alunite and jarosite.  In addition, they will help to constrain                 the chemical and isotope systematics of jarosite at lower                       temperatures, and thus complement ongoing studies of jarosite at                25oC.  A better understanding of the properties of jarosite at                  surficial conditions will be important in the study of acid-mine                drainage, and also in the interpretation of natural weathering                  and oxidation of pyritic ore deposits.",
