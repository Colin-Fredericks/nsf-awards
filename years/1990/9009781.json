 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mature human visual system, adept at detecting dynamic                      sensory events, often shifts attention automatically toward a                   detected movement or change in the environment.  There are many                 studies of the maturation in infants of spatial aspects of                      vision, such as acuity and preferences for various stationary                   patterns, but fewer studies of the temporal characteristics of                  infant vision.  Yet the infant, from an early age, encounters a                 dynamic sensory world.  This research will examine the                          development of infants' visual sensitivity to temporal changes.                 The initial goal is to assess infant preferences for flashing                   displays by presenting two patterns flickering at different                     rates.  The research will use measures of the time infants spend                looking at each pattern, along with physiological measures of                   their eye movements and heart rate, to assess preferences and                   thus infer temporal sensitivity.  Further studies will                          investigate the cueing effects of flashing or moving stimuli                    presented in the periphery of the visual field.  Although infants               can localize lights and sounds coarsely soon after birth, these                 abilities become greatly refined during early infancy.  The third               goal is to use the attention-attracting nature of stimulus change               as a probe of infant attention.  The question is how readily                    abrupt changes in the visual periphery will distract infants'                   viewing of centrally-presented stimuli.  Initial activities will                include selection of suitable stimuli for infants of different                  ages and pilot work on precise measurement of shifts in visual                  fixation.  This research will study infants from 2 through 6                    months of age, spanning the period during which temporal acuity                 in the visual system is undergoing rapid developmental change.                  The research will address both the development of the visual                    system and the implications of more temporally-refined visual                   processing for the infant's attention to their surroundings.                    Maturation of the ability to detect change, to localize the                     source of the change, and to focus attention to the sensory event               is necessary for developing competence in interaction with                      persons and objects in the environment.",
