 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research agenda is divided into the following topics: (1)                   perfect competition in large assignment models; (2) efficiency                  properties of competitive equilibrium with innovation; and (3)                  specialization and division of labor and monetary exchange.  The                first part involves extending the basic model assigning a finite                number of individuals to a finite number of positions to one in                 which the number of individuals and positions are infinite and                  represented by a continuum.  The second part consists of modeling               the innovation problem as a two-tiered assignment problem in which              the allocation of resources, including the commodities available                for sale, is influenced by occupational choices.  The third part                examines the trade-off between the technological advantages of                  assignments exhibiting specialization and division of labor and the             disadvantages of such assignments in terms of the demands that this             places on the technology of exchange.                                                                                                                           Research on all three topics is potentially extremely important.                In the first topic the proposed work could lead to a new way of                 conceptualizing competition that would capture as special cases                 such criteria as non manipulability of prices and the appropriation             of agents' marginal contributions.  The assignment model has a rich             history as a laboratory for the development of important new                    theories such as linear programming and core theory.  Past work by              the investigator and his collaborators suggests that their study                of the uniqueness of equilibrium prices in large assignment models              could provide another new, powerful analytical tool for economic                theory.  The second and third parts should provide new insights                 into such fundamental questions as: how are new commodities                     introduced? why are markets incomplete? how does specialization and             the division of labor depend on the exchange process, or                        transaction technology?",
