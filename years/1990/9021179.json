 "awd_abstract_narration": "California State University, Los Angeles is seeking a                           planning grant in the amount of $39,597 under the NSF                           Alliances for Minority Participation (AMP) Program.  Cal                        State L.A. will match the NSF grant with $39,861 in \"in kind\"                   and direct financial contributions.  The objective of the AMP                   Program will be to substantially increase both the quantity                     and quality of underrepresented minorities receiving                            baccalaureate degrees in engineering and science from the                       participating universities and to increase the percentage of                    those students that continue on to full-time graduate study.                                                                                                    Twelve universities have agreed to enter the AMP planning                       phase.  These universities were selected based on their                         minority enrollment, commitment to minority education,                          geographical location in the Western United States, and the                     expertise they each bring to the AMP planning process.  Six                     to eight of these universities will form the eventual AMP                       alliance.                                                                                                                                                       The participating universities will work together to                            implement a \"model\" AMP program on their campuses.  The model                   AMP program will have the following six elements: 1) a                          community college transition program; 2) a retention program                    in the engineering academic unit; 3) a retention program in                     the math/science academic unity; 4) a faculty training                          program; 5) an undergraduate research initiative; and 6) an                     initiative to increase the percentage of minority                               engineering and science graduates that continue on to                           full-time graduate study.  As indicated, in addition to                         undergraduate education the proposed AMP program will focus                     on two other transition: 2-year to 4-year college; and                          undergraduate-to-graduate study.                                                                                                                                Each university selected has at least one and some as many as                   three or four of the above program elements already in place.                   And every program element is being operated by at least two                     participating universities.  The proposed AMP Program will be                   a true alliance because participating universities will both                    share their expertise and work together to develop resources                    in support of AMP.  A strength of the proposed AMP program is                   that it is based on sound programmatic approaches which will                    take advantage of proven technologies, improve those                            technologies, develop new approaches where needed, and                          disseminate those approaches both within the alliance and                       across the nation.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Raymond B. Landis, Dean of Engineering and Technology, at                   California State University, Los Angeles and a nationally                       recognized expert in minority student education will be the                     Principal Investigator of the proposed AMP Program.  He                         has assembled a Steering Committee comprised of highly                          qualified individuals to guide the AMP planning phase.",
