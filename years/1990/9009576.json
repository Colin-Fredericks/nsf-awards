 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flame growth of diamond films is controlled by nucleation on                    the substrate, and diffusion of the growth species through the                  boundary layer formed by the jet of hot gas.  It is proposed                    to monitor these effects by in situ long focal distance                         microscopy using a Questar microscope.  Edge-on observation of                  the impinging gas jet with this microscope, which provides 2                    micron resolution at 15 cm, will allow us to map out the                        variation in the boundary layer thickness across the                            deposition area.  This information will be used to study the                    effects of gas flow on the heat and mass transfer to the                        growing film.  Direct high resolution observation of the                        substrate will allow one to make a real-time video of the                       growing film, and will help clarify the steps in the                            nucleation process.  Work on electrochemical deposition will                    be more qualitative and exploratory, since no electrochemical                   diamond deposition process has yet been demonstrated.  The                      search for a useful process will attempt to exploit analogies                   with electrodeposition of silicon, germanium and other                          refractory semiconductors.                                                                                                                                      There has recently been an intense international research                       effort in the field of low pressure, low temperature diamond                    film growth.  Because of the superlative properties of                          diamond, including hardness, thermal conductivity and chemical                  inertness, the potential impact of low cost diamond in many                     areas of technology would be very great.  The goal of this                      research project is to investigate experimentally the kinetics                  of several promising diamond film growth techniques, including                  chemical combustion flame growth, plasma flame growth, and                      electrochemical deposition.",
