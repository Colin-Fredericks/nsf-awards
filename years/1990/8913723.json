 "awd_abstract_narration": "Airborne particles play a vital role in maintaining the                    earth's energy balance, sustaining ecosystems and influencing                   global cycles of chemical species.  Unfortunately, our                          understanding of the processes affecting these particles, from                  emissions to their ultimate fate, is far from complete.  A                      particular deficiency concerns our limited knowledge of particle                removal from the atmosphere by dry deposition.                                       The overall goal of this project is to determine the most                  important factors influencing dry deposition of airborne                        particles, focusing on interactions between particles and the                   surface of vegetation.  There are three specific objectives:                    1) to develop improved mathematical formulations for several                    mechanisms of particle-surface interaction,  2) to verify these                 formulations through wind tunnel tests, and 3) to apply the                     formulations to field conditions by developing and verifying an                 in-canopy deposition model.  Objective 1 will be achieved by                    improving existing formulations in the areas of turbulent                       transport through the viscous sublayer, electrostatic                           attractions, and resuspension.  Objective 2 will be achieved by                 conducting deposition and reentrainment measurements in a wind                  tunnel using monodisperse uranine particles that can be measured                by fluorescence.  Finally, objective 3 will be achieved by                      developing a model that relates airborne concentrations within                  the canopy and geometry of the vegetation elements are used as                  model inputs.  Measurement of dry deposition of ambient chemical                species with known size distributions will allow verification of                the model.  The results of this study will enable a better                      understanding of the most important processes influencing                       particle dry deposition onto natural surfaces.  This, in turn,                  will yield more accurate prediction of dry deposition as a                      component of atmospheric transport models.",
