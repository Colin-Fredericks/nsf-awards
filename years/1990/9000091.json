 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimizing the chances of survival of rare or endangered                   plants is a fundamental concern of plant conservation biologists.               Part of this effort involves assessing the current \"health\" of                  populations and predicting chances of their long-term survival.                 This work will compare two methods of assessing population                      \"health\" and the likelihood of long-term survival for the royal                 catch-fly (Silene regia), a prairie relict.  The investigators                  will determine levels of genetic variation in populations of                    various size, isolation, and management using biochemical                       techniques.  It is generally held that populations high in                      genetic variation are better buffered against environmental                     perturbations in the short-term and that genetic variation                      provides a pool of resources that can be drawn from for long-term               adaption and evolutionary change.  However, the importance of                   genetic variation to the persistence of plant populations has                   rarely been demonstrated with field studies.                                         The investigators will compare data from genetic studies                   with demographic data of actual survival, seed production, and                  seedling establishment of plants in the same sites.  Computer                   modeling will be used to project, based on actual values recorded               over the relatively short term of the study, into the future to                 estimate which populations are most likely to persist.",
