 "awd_abstract_narration": "Produce an exhibition that will lead visitors,                             particularly 140,000 school children each year, to explore and                  understand modern audio technology.  The exhibition capitalizes                 on the great popularity of recorded music (every student seems                  to carry a Walkman tape or disc player), to encourage hands-on                  exploration of audio technologies from microphones to compact                   disc players.  Further visitor inquiry, using a computer-based                  system developed by the Hall of Science, will encourage an                      understanding of the underlying principles.  The prototype of                   this \"Science Link\" system, now in use, has already drawn                       replication inquiries from 84 science-technology centers,                       educational institutions, and advertising agencies.                                                                                                                  Develop additional exhibit techniques that will allow the                  hands-on investigation of phenomena that cannot be directly                     observed.  Techniques linking computer simulations directly to                  the physical exhibits will encourage investigation of phenomena                 that cannot be directly observed.  While contemporary                           electronic technology has become more and more pervasive, its                   inner workings have become less and less accessible to the                      layman.  In addressing audio technology as typical of this                      challenge, the project will have applications to many                           fundamental and applied topics, and will find wide use in                       science centers and other settings.",
