 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in number theory of                       Professor Hendrik Lenstra of the University of California at                    Berkeley. Dr. Lenstra has proposed to continue his research in                  several directions. In primality testing and factorization of                   large integers, he will study the newest factoring algorithm,                   known as the Number Field Sieve, and work on the practical                      implementation of a primality test. In algebraic number theory,                 he will investigate the existence of governing fields and study                 the class group structure of abelian fields.                                         Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                  the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                    mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                     furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the               fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most                recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                  appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.",
