 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of algorithms involves two important aspects, correctness             and complexity.  This project addresses these two aspects from a                machine independent viewpoint by using formulas of mathematical                 logic.  Logic formulas can provide descriptions of solutions to                 problems which can then be analyzed for their correctness and                   complexity.                                                                                                                                                     Of particular interest is to develop a feasible set of logical                  formulas for P, the class of problems which are tractable, i.e., whose          solutions require only a polynomial number of machine steps, and in             addition, to provide a system for reasoning about the properties of             these logical formulas.  Finding a comprehensive description of such a          set of formulas would exhibit a machine independent definition of P             and have a significant impact on our understanding of the algorithms            for this important complexity class.  If successful, this system could          provide a method by which one could demonstrate that a given formula            is the correct solution to certain problem.  As an alternative to               program correctness, this may provide a deeper understanding of                 algorithmic correctness.",
