 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jeffrey Parsons, Mr. Marco Ribeiro                   will conduct archaeological field research to collect data for                  his doctoral dissertation.  Working in the Tumilaca drainage, a                 tributary of the Osmore River in Southern Peru, he will conduct                 excavations at four prehistoric sites which date to the Late                    Intermediate Period (ca. 1100 to 1480 AD).  The goal of his                     project is to understand changes in agricultural production in                  this prehistoric community over an extended period of time and to               examine the interaction between climate, long distance trade, and               social organization with this localized region.  Archaeological                 evidence indicates that over time agricultural production first                 intensified but that later terraces are abandoned.  Mr. Ribeiro                 hypothesizes that inter-regional exchange induced surplus                       production while succeeding conditions of chronic drought led to                terrace abandonment.  His field program directly addresses the                  first of these issues, and excavation of a series of habitation                 units in four settlements will provide data on both                             intensification of food production and the degree of regional                   exchange.                                                                                                                                                       This project is important for several reasons.  Not only will it                increase our understanding of the rise and decline of complex                   societies in Peru, but it should also provide information of                    direct agricultural use.  At one time many areas which today are                abandoned were employed in agricultural production.  The Tumilaca               terraces fall into this category, and if one can understand why                 they were abandoned it should be possible to determine whether                  they might play a future productive role.  This project will also               assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
