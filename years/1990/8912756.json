 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new research effort is to experimentally and                               theoretically investigate the physics of plasmas                                created by electron cyclotron resonance (ECR)                                   microwave plasma sources.  The results of this                                  research will expand understanding of microwave                                 generated plasmas and may enable the design of                                  improved sources to be used for anisotropic, plasma                             reactive-ion etching or other types of plasma                                   processing of surfaces.  The project is divided into                            three stages.  In the first stage, very detailed                                laboratory measurements will be made of a relatively                            small cavity ECR source with simple cylindrical                                 boundary conditions.  A three-axis, computer-                                   controlled probe diagnostic will be used to generate                            three-dimensional images of the applied                                         electromagnetic field within the plasma, the plasma                             density and Langmuir probe characteristics, and the                             plasma particle and energy effluent.  In the second                             stage, a precise model of the interaction between the                           microwave fields and the plasma will be developed                               and then implemented numerically enabling a one-                                to-one comparison between measurements and                                      experiment.  The objective of the microwave-plasma                              model is to develop a steady-state and ultimately self-                         consistent description of (1) microwave propagation                             and absorption through the source cavity, and (2)                               plasma particle and power balance along a magnetic                              field-line.  Finally, in the third stage, a modified ECR                        source cavity will be designed in collaboration with                            IBM in order to optimize particular plasma                                      parameters of mutual interest.  This new source                                 cavity will be constructed and tested using the three-                          axis probe diagnostic, thereby, evaluating the success                          of the model as a design tool.  Funds for the                                   theoretical modeling portion of this project are being                          provided by IBM.",
