The NYS Center for Advanced Technology                   in Automation and Robotics will conduct a two-week resident                     course entitled \"Computer Integrated Engineering and                            Manufacturing Systems\".  Recruitment will concentrate on                        identifying potential minority, female, and disabled students                   from throughout NYS.  The course will offer instruction in                      key disciplinary subjects, hands-on laboratory experience,                      and exposure to operating manufacturing facilities.  Emphasis                   will be placed on exposing students to research                                 methodologies, exploring careers in engineering and                             discussions of the philosophy and ethics of the engineering                     profession.  The knowledge gained during this course will                       assist students in career selection and increase the number                     of students selecting an engineering curriculum for                             universities studies.  Follow up activities will allow                          students the opportunity to give presentations on their                         academic experience to fellow students.",
