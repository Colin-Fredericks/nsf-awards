 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad objective is to understand how organims can manipulate                their DNA.  The model system is hypotrichous ciliated protozoa,                 which manipulate their DNA extensively during development of the                macronucleus from a micronucleus after cell mating.  During                     macornuclear development all genes are excised from the chromosomes             and exist in the mature macronucleus as 20,000 different and                    separate DNA molecules ranging in size from 400 pairs (bp) to                   12,000 bp.  An example of cutting and joining of DNA is the                     chromosomal actin gene, which contains nine exons in the order 1-               2-4-5-6-7-8-9 separated by eight intronlike sequences.  The                     intronlike sequences are eliminated and the nine exons are                      rearranged and joined in the order 8-7-1-2-4-3-5-9-6.  Reordering               and removal of intronlike sequences is necessary to yield a                     functional actin gene.  The specific aims are: (1) to identify                  other genes in which removal of intronlike sequences is accompanied             by reordering of exons; (2) to track the temporal order of steps                in removal of intronlike sequences and joining of exons in the                  micronuclear acting gene, followed by telomere addition, during                 maconuclear development using primarily the polymerase chain                    reaction (PCR) technique.",
