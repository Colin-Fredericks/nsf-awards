 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support planning an activity-based                       statistics course for undergraduates that draws from recent                     experiences at the secondary level and in industry, where                       statistics has been made relevant by focusing on the analysis of                data of interest to the participants.  A laboratory-type course                 will be planned that emphasizes modern data analysis and                        graphical techniques, student projects, case studies, technology,               and innovative teaching practices that treat statistics as a                    laboratory science.  It is expected that the project will provide               model data analysis lessons, resource reviews, and a network of                 contributors and potential users so that a laboratory-type course               in statistics can actually be written and implemented.  Through                 its advisory committee, this planning project will be connected                 to other major efforts designed to improve the teaching of                      statistics across the country.",
