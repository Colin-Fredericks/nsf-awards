 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of the proposed research is to identify                 the sperm receptor(s) on the surface of the mouse oocyte,                       characterize it biochemically and study its functional role in                  fertilization. although the sperm receptor(s) in the zona                       pellucida continue to be the focus of important research on                     mammalian fertilization, evidence argues that there must be an                  oocyte surface protein that mediates fertilization proper between               egg and sperm. Research proposed in this application will                       identify the sperm receptor and raise antisera against it. Dr.                  Calarco's preliminary work identifies a limited number of                       candidate proteins and also shows that the known cell adhesion                  protein, uvomorulin, is not preset on unfertilized eggs. The                    specific aims are: 1) To determine which surface proteins(s) on                 the zona free unfertilized egg are required for the egg to bind                 sperm and undergo fertilization. Initially, Dr. Calarco will                    compare, by gel electrophoresis, labeled oocyte surface proteins                before and after protease treatment (which renders eggs                         infertile), and before and after fertilization; and 2) To                       demonstrate which of the putative sperm receptors from                          unfertilized eggs function in an in vitro assay as a sperm                      receptor. This will involve blocking fertilization of zona free                 eggs with polyclonal antisera made against proteins identified on               1-D gels. After initially using polyclonal antisera to isolate                  receptor(s), she will prepare monospecific antisera for all                     subsequent studies.                                                             %%%                                                                             Information gained from the proposed research is relevant to                    problems of infertility, normal and abnormal development as well                as contraception.",
