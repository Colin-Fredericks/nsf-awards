 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work focuses on the study of coordination between AI                       systems.  One objective is to take techniques developed for                     different aspects of coordination and unify them in a single                    computational theory.  Initially, the work will develop a                       formalism and computational theory that can lead to novel                       coordination techniques by drawing together the separate                        approaches of planning, organizational design, and scheduling.                  This theory provides a powerful framework for improving                         performance, reducing overhead, increasing reliability, and                     flexibly managing distributed resources among AI systems.  The                  work will lead toward a generic coordination framework for                      developing AI systems, because we believe that reasoning about                  interactions with others is fundamental to intelligence.                        A second objective of DIAL is to build an experimental                          infrastructure for validating coordination theories and                         discovering new theories.  To facilitate comparisons between                    alternative theories both within DIAL and elsewhere, a versatile,               portable simulation testbed will be developed.  Techniques will                 also be integrated into actual mobile robots to investigate the                 interplay between sensing, acting, reasoning, and communicating                 in real-time physical systems.  The research will help pave the                 way for introducing intelligent, cooperating robots into real-                  world environments.",
