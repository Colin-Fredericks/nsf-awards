 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major controversy exists regarding the adaptive significance of               large floral displays in plants with consistently low fruit-set:                why produce so many the extra flowers are there to produce pollen               which will successfully convey male genes to other flowers.  This               \"pollen donation hypothesis\" has been a difficult issue to                      address.  While it is reasonably easy to measure fruit or seed                  production, it is technically much more difficult to quantify                   pollen success.                                                                      Recently, plant population biologists have turned to                       paternity exclusion analysis as a possible solution to the                      problem.  In principle, the technique is identical to the process               of using blood types to determine human paternity.                                   The proposed research will test the pollen donation                        hypothesis in milkweeds (Asclepias).  Genetic markers from                      protein electrophoresis will be used to perform a paternity                     exclusion analysis.  This will identify seeds sired by individual               plants in the population.  Inflorescence size will be manipulated               by removing flowers in experimental populations to determine the                relationship between inflorescence size and numbers of seeds                    sired and numbers of seeds produced.                                                 This study will yield important basic information about the                forces that shape the evolution of inflorescence size in plants.                It will also provide data regarding levels of gene flow within                  and between populations.  Finally the development of paternity                  analysis in plants will provide a basis for investigating                       breeding systems of both native and crop plants.  Furthermore,                  should the need arise again (as in World War II) for milkweeds to               be used as substitute sources of kapok and rubber, we will                      understand better the forces that limit fruit-set and will have                 new insights into how to design effective breeding programs.",
