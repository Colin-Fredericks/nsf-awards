 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of a parallel architecture is the interconnection           network, which can be represented as a graph.  Many graphs have been            proposed as suited to parallel computation.  Previous research has              partially answered the questions of which graphs to use for which               problems and of which graphs are most generally useful for parallel             processing.  What has been lacking are uniform techniques and a                 comprehensive theory for analyzing parallel networks.                                                                                                           The central thesis of this research project is that analogies to the            mathematical theory of algebraic topology can provide a foundation for          a theory of parallel networks.  New topologies for graphs are defined           that capture the essence of the graphs as parallel networks.                    Topological invariants are defined that facilitate comparison and               evaluation of networks, and efficient algorithms are given to compute           these invariants.  The standard technique for simulating one parallel           network by another is via graph embeddings.  In the topological                 framework, a graph embedding is a special kind of continuous function           between topolical spaces.  Algorithms are given to compute the                  homotopology and homology groups of a graph and to compute the group            homomorphisms induced by a graph embedding.  Techniques are developed           to prove upper and lower bounds on the ability of one network to                simulate another.                                                                                                                                               The ultimate result of this research is a unified mathematical theory           of graphs as parallel architectures.",
