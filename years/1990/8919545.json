 "awd_abstract_narration": "All societies can be viewed as a plurality of normative orders                  capable of generating rules, customs, symbols, and compliance.                  Termed \"legal pluralism,\" the study of the operation and                        interrelation of multiple normative orders has provided a major                 impetus for the reconceptualization of the law and society                      relation.  Instead of being viewed as a \"top-down\" phenomena, law               effectively is the result of the interaction of historical,                     cultural, social, political, and economic forces.  Recent work in               sociolegal studies has focused on this relationship and the ways                in which it has affected legal change.                                                                                                                          Using an analysis of the interaction of legal orders in New                     Zealand as a vehicle for the study of legal pluralism, this                     dissertation research will examine historical and contemporary                  patterns of impositions, accommodations, and resistances that                   have marked struggles over rights and resources in colonial and                 post-colonial settings.  Specifically, the student will study a                 Maori land claim against the New Zealand government for                         violations of an 1840 Treaty.  Through archival research,                       statistical and demographic information, analysis of land tenure                patterns, and community level oral histories, it will be possible               to ascertain how law has structured the representation of                       interests, reflecting or facilitating political and economic                    change.                                                                                                                                                         Ethnic claims, plural legal systems, and politicization of                      \"tradition\" are familiar themes in the contemporary world.  Legal               strategies for addressing them are of considerable importance.                  This project has potential for contributing to a broader                        theoretical understanding of the factors that impinge on such                   situations.  In a period in which land claims are being made in                 many parts of the world by the descendants of the original                      inhabitants of areas subsequently appropriated by other                         populations, this work has practical applications as well.",
