 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a few exceptions, the current role of database knowledge is                to assist in the evaluation of data queries.  This project                      applies database knowledge in two new tasks: knowledge queries                  and intensional answers.  When database knowledge is of                         substantial volume and complexity, there is genuine need to                     interrogate it directly.  Moreover, since users of the database                 may not be able to distinguish between information that is data                 and information that is knowledge, both should be available for                 querying, preferably by means of a single instrument that would                 blur the distinction.  Database knowledge can also be used to                   characterize the extensional answers issued by the database.                    Knowledge statements that apply to an extensional answer are                    inferred from the global knowledge and presented as an                          intensional answer, thus providing extensional answers with                     additional meaning and insight.  This project extends the role of               knowledge, to provide answers that contain knowledge, either in                 response to knowledge queries, or in response to data queries.                  As these two topics have much in common, they are investigated                  within a common framework, logic databases, to provide a unified                solution: a query language for both data and knowledge, and an                  answering mechanism that responds with both data and knowledge.                 The results of this research are expected to improve the                        expressivity of query languages and the meaningfulness of                       database responses.",
