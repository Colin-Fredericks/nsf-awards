In this regard, support will continue for the                 existing 56 kbps data communications link connecting the U.S.                   research and academic networks (NSFNET, NASA, Science Internet,                 Energy Sciences Network, etc.,) to networks used by scientic                    communities in France and, in the near future, Switzerland.  This               will enable continuation of service, based on TCP/IP in France                  and Switzerland, to scientists in these countries wishing to                    communicate for purposes of scientific collaboration or to access               unique computer-based resources.  The world-class SIMBAD                        astronomical data base, maintained by the Strasbourg (France)                   Stellar Data Center on a computer near Paris, is an example of a                unique resource of great importance to U.S. and for support                     personnel at Princeton University.  The French National Research                Institute for Informatics and Automatics (INRIA) participates by                paying the French share of the circuit costs and by maintaining                 the communications gateway at their Sophia-Antipolis campus.***//",
