 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proportion of females in an animal species directly                    influences the rate of population growth, and thus is important                 for understanding population dynamics.  Although equal numbers of               each sex are produced in many animals, members of some groups,                  such as the parasitic wasps, often exhibit highly variable sex                  ratios.  Understanding the mechanisms that produce these variable               sex ratios is necessary to predict population fluctuations.  In                 addition, variable sex ratios offer a good opportunity to study                 the process of adaptation, since optimal sex ratios can be                      predicted using evolutionary models, and the fit to theory can be               easily measured experimentally.                                                      In a group of minute parasitic wasps in the family                         Aphelinidae females lay male and female eggs in different hosts.                Female eggs are laid inside nymphs of Homoptera, such as whitefly               and scale insects, while male eggs are laid inside the body of                  immature female wasps while they are still developing within the                homopteran host.  Males are parasitic on female wasps, often of                 their own species.  This study involves investigating the sex                   allocation behavior of females of an autoparasitoid,  Encarsia                  pergandiella, which parasitizes whiteflies.  In particular, the                 investigator is investigating how females allocate eggs to be                   sons and daughters given the constraint on sex ratio imposed by                 the availability of the appropriate hosts.  The pattern of egg                  laying in the two host will be examined over the season when the                availability of the two hosts, and the density varies.  In the                  laboratory, factors which may alter the sex allocation behavior                 such as host density, previous experience and female age will be                examined.  The results will be interpreted in the context of                    evolutionary theory.                                                                 This system offers a unique opportunity to test sex ratio                  theory.  Fisher predicted that natural selection should equalize                the investment of resources in each sex.  Generally this leads to               a 1:1 sex ratio, but in autoparasitoids the predicted sex ratio                 varies with the limited resource.  When eggs are limiting, sons                 and daughters should be produced in equal numbers, but when hosts               are limiting, the sex ratio should reflect the relative                         availability of the two hosts.  In addition, autoparasitoids have               been used in many instances to biologically control scale and                   whitefly pests, often with tremendous economic and environmental                benefits due to reduced numbers of pesticide applications.  Sex                 ratio is central to the population biology of these wasps, and,                 therefore, an understanding of the mechanisms that control sex                  ratio will improve our ability to evaluate wasp species for their               potential to control pest species.",
