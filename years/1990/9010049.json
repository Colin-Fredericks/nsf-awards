 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent events in both the United States and the Soviet Union                    have created a productive environment for, and strong                           interest in, scientific cooperation in the field of Arctic                      social science research.  In the United States, the Arctic                      Policy Research Act of 1984, together with reports of the                       National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and other bodies, have                       focused attention on this field; as a result the National                       Science Foundation (NSF) has recently established a new                         program in Arctic Social Science Research.  In the U.S.S.R.,                    intense public debate has emerged over the socioeconomic and                    ecological impacts of northern development has led to                           significant interest in social science research on these                        areas on the part of the Soviet scientific community.  The                      primary objective of this workshop is to take advantage of                      the rising interest in both countries in this field by                          giving leading U.S. and Soviet specialists an opportunity to                    exchange information on current work and to develop plans for                   long-term cooperative research, with particular emphasis on                     the relationships between human communities and the biological                  and physical systems that make up the natural environment of                    the Arctic.                                                                                                                                                     The workshop is being organized jointly by the U.S. National                    Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Academy of Sciences of the                    U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR).  The NAS participation is being managed by                   the NAS/National Research Council Polar Research Board and                      the delegation will be led by Dr. Oran Young of Dartmouth                       College.  The Soviet delegation, under the auspices of the                      ASUSSR Commission for Arctic Research, will be chaired by                       Academician V.M. Kotlyakov, Director of the ASUSSR Institute                    of Geography.                                                                                                                                                   This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
