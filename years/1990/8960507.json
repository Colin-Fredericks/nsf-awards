 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of aseismic design of                                            structures using base isolation techniques is                                   becoming increasingly evident to architects                                     and structural engineers.  Many different                                       types of base isolators, generally complex                                      mechanical systems which require an extra                                       floor beneath the building, have been proposed                                  to date.  Existing isolation systems are                                        either of a pure-friction or flexible type, or                                  a combination of the two.  They reduce                                          earthquake-induced lateral inertial forces on                                   structures through limiting friction effects                                    and/or lengthening the natural period of                                        vibration of the total system.                                                                                                                                  This research project studies a new base                                        isolation system comprised of alternate                                         geosynthetic liners and soil layers.                                            Geomembrane and geotextile geosynthetics                                        typically have very low friction coefficients.                                  A layered geotextile/geomembrane-soil system                                    provides a practical, low-cost, and simple-to-                                  install base isolation system through low                                       frictional properties of geosynthetics and the                                  flexibility of a soil layer.  Lateral                                           deflection of structures may be limited by                                      hysteretic damping of the soil layer and by                                     soft backfill materials around the building                                     basement.
