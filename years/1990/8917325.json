 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study the molecular basis for the specific                recognition of nucleic acids by proteins, and the factors                       involved their regulatory interactions, both in vivo and in                     vitro.  The work will focus on the structurally well-                           characterized trp repressor of E. coli, and will be concentrated                in five areas.                                                                       1.  A thorough study of operator DNA structure/function                    relations will be made including their role in the recognition                  process.  An oligonucleotide representing the operator will be                  synthesized, along with a control DNA of identical composition                  but unrelated sequence.  The average solution conformation of                   these DNAs will be defer mined using circular dichroism (CD).                   The thermodynamics of the helix-coil transition for these DNAs                  will be determined using CD, and the results will be compared to                those obtained in the presence of the repressor.                                     2..Development of new reliable, quantitative assays for the                binding reactions of trp repressor will be undertaken.  First, it               will be ascertained whether protein binding causes a change in                  the CD spectrum of the DNA; this assay is likely to be suitable                 only for nonspecific binding. In an effort to assay specific                    binding, fluorescent probes will be attached to the DNA at sites                where they may be quenched by the bound protein without                         interfering greatly with its binding.                                                 3.  The affinity and specificity of trp repressor for                     binding to DNA will be determined under the exact conditions that               have been used for crystallization of the complex.  The results                 should establish whether these conditions are compatible with                   operator-specific binding, and would thus resolve a major                       controversy engendered by the crystal structure.                                     4.  A complete analysis of the biochemical and thermodynamic               characteristics of the in vitro binding reactions of the                        repressor will be made.  Salt concentration and temperature                     dependence for binding to specific and nonspecific DNA and to                   tryptophan will be measured, and related to what is known about                 the structure of the protein.  We will be used to establish                     whether an order-disorder transition explains the large CP for                  DNA binding found in the temperature studies.                                        5.  In vivo and in vitro experiments will be carried out to                determine the detailed molecular mechanism of transcriptional                   control by trp repressor.  The question of whether the effect of                repressor on RNA polymerase is the same at the three known sites                of regulation, and which step in the polymerase mechanisms is                   affected at each site will be investigated.  The affinities of                  the three operators in vivo will be compared, ant it will be                    determined if repressor and polymerase communicate to modulate                  each other's interactions with the DNA.",
