 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sense of touch allows discrimination of texture and spatial                 properties of objects, in addition to conveying timing                          information on properties such as vibration to the brain.  One                  class of mechanoreceptor in mammals shows a slowly adapting                     response to deformation; are called T1 or SA 1 receptors and                    are found in small domed structures under the skin.  These                      domes are contacted by terminals of single nerve cells that                     carry the signal to the brain.  There may be more than one site                 where responses are generated in such neurons, so that each                     neuron may have several nearby zones of maximal touch                           sensitivity, to allow sophisticated spatial and temporal                        processing.  This project combines engineering and biological                   techniques and modelling to examine the physiological responses                 from these receptor organs, using a novel stimulus technology.                  The emphasis will be on understanding the temporal, spatial,                    and mechanical aspects of interactions between response                         generator sites.  Results will be incorporated and compared to                  numerical models, to clarify possible mechanisms for encoding                   the signals, for the brain to use in tactile discrimination.                    This novel approach will provide needed data on the role of                     micromechanics and spatial integration on touch, and will have                  impact on neuroscience studies of sensory coding, and on                        engineering aspects of artificial tactile sensors for robotics.",
