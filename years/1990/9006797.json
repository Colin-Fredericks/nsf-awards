 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robert Baker, at Texas Tech University, is undertaking a               multi-faceted study of a hybrid zone between two chromosomal                    races or subspecies of the white-footed deer mouse, Peromyscus                  leucopis, focused on hybrid dysgenesis. Preliminary data indicate               that variation in DNA content and frequency of chromosomal                      aberrations is heightened in the hybrid zone. A goal of the                     research is to determine the genetic basis of this dysgenesis.                  This will be accomplished by controlled genetic crosses in the                  laboratory and the comparison of measures of dysgenesis between                 the progeny of these crosses and measures made in naturally                     occurring populations. The distribution of two DNA sequences, K18               and mys will also be examined in parental and hybrid animals. Mys               is a retrovirus-like transposable element and k18 is a satellite                DNA associated with heterochromatic regions of chromosomes. Dr.                 Baker hypothesizes a relationship between DNA content variation,                chromosomal aberrations, and changes in the genomic                             distributions of mys and k18 sequences, all resulting from hybrid               dysgenesis. This study will provide insight to the genetic                      changes that occur as new species are formed.",
