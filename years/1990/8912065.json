 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed study of the enzyme-catalyzed preparation of                    polymers will be undertaken in two general areas:  (1)                          exploration of the factors which determine the molecular weight                 of (AA-BB)x polyesters formed by hydrolase-catalyzed                            transesterification in organic solvents; and (2) exploration of                 the scope and limitations of enzyme-catalyzed polymerization                    method.                                                                              In examining the factors affecting molecular weight,                       variations will be made relative to a standard polycondensation,                the porcine pancreatic lipase catalyzed reaction of bis(2,2,2-                  trichloroethyl) glutarate with 1,4-butanediol in anhydrous ether                at combient temperature. Among the factors to be varied in a                    systematic fashion are the stoichiometry of the monomers, the                   concentratins, of the reactants and the catalyst in the solvent,                the length of the monomers, the leaving group lost in the                       transesterification, the solvent, the reaction temperature, and                 the enzyme catalyst.                                                                                                                                                 The scope and limitations of enzyme-catalyzed                              polycondensations will be explored in five areas:  (1)                          preparation of (AA-BB)x polymers form a variety of different                    diester (or diacid) and diol monomers and examination of the                    early intermediates formed during the process; (2) extension of                 the process to the formation of of (A-B)x polymer; (3)                          development of additional examples of optically active polymer                  formation using the method; (4) application of enzymes in the                   preparation of stereoregular monomers; (5) examination of the                   ability of enzymes to make polymers other than polyesters such as               polyamides polycarbonates.",
