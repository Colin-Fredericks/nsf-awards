 "awd_abstract_narration": "Irradiance stress directly affects the structure of the photosystems in         plant chloroplasts.  These adjustments apparently help optimize                 photosynthesis and allow the plant to retain efficient growth under             suboptimal and/or adverse irradiance conditions.  The overall goal of           this research is to understand the fundamental mechanism of plant               response to suboptimal and adverse irradiance.  Components of thylakoid         membranes which are found in chloroplasts will be studied.  Specific            goals of this proposal are to identify the primary receptor of the              signal (irradiance stress) and elucidate the first step in the signal           transduction and transformation process leading to a plant response.            Experimental methodologies and approaches to be employed include                absorbance difference spectrophotometry, gel electrophoresis and                immunoblot (western) analysis, radioactive labelling and                        autoradiography, and DNA-RNA hybridization (northern analysis).                                                                                                 This research addresses a novel idea, namely that photosynthetic                pigments act in the primary step of adverse irradiance recognition and          that signal transduction is mediated by electron transport reactions in         the thylakoid membrane.  There is preliminary evidence to suggest that          such a molecular feedback control mechanism guides plant response to            irradiance stress and this proposal will examine this mechanism.                Results from this research will improve our understanding of the                mechanisms by which photosynthetic plants perceive and adapt to                 irradiance stress including ultraviolet radiation (UV-B).  This will            have implications for predicting plant response to potential increases          in UV-B that may result from depletion of stratospheric ozone in the            atmosphere.",
