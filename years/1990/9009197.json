 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colonies of social ants, bees, and wasps provide fascinating                    examples of cooperation in the animal world.  However, modern                   evolutionary theory suggests that there should be considerable                  conflict over reproduction within an insect colony.  In                         particular, there should be conflict between individual workers                 and the queen over male production.  (Worker ants, bees, and                    wasps are females.  In most species, workers cannot mate but can                lay unfertilized eggs, which develop into males.)  Theory                       suggests that individual workers should prefer to rear their own                sons rather than their brothers, the sons of the queen, because                 they are more genetically related to sons than brothers.  In some               species of social insects, for example, bumble bees, workers                    produce many of the colony's males, whereas in others, for                      example, honey bees and yellowjacket wasps, all the males are                   sons of the queen.                                                                                                                                              The absence of male honey bees produced by workers is thought to                result from workers preventing each other from reproducing by                   eating each other's eggs.  This \"worker policing\" has apparently                evolved in the honey bee because the queen mates with many males.               This leads to workers being more genetically related to the                     queen's sons than to the sons of other workers (who are mostly                  half-sisters), so that it is in each worker's genetic interest to               stop other workers from reproducing.  In contrast, bumble-bee                   queens mate with only one male, so that workers are more related                to the sons of the workers (who are all full sisters) than to the               queen's sons, and should not stop each other from reproducing.                                                                                                  This research project will examine in more detail the mechanism                 of worker policing in honey bees, and also look at yellowjacket                 wasps to see if worker policing by differential egg removal                     occurs in these insects as well.  One important area of research                will investigate how worker honey bees can distinguish queen-                   from worker-laid male eggs, by looking for a queen-produced                     chemical (pheromone) that may give their eggs a distinctive odor.               In addition, the project will quantify the rate of production of                worker-laid eggs in normal bee hives, and will look at the                      behavior of worker bees entering cells containing male eggs to                  see if some workers are special \"police bees.\"",
