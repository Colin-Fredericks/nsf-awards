 "awd_abstract_narration": "These experiments will examine the evolutionary dynamics of                genetically variable Bacillus subtilis populations in soil                      microcosms and examine the biological and physical factors which                facilitate recombination.  The experiments will be performed                    during a sabbatical leave in the laboratory of Dr.C.A. Istock at                the University of Arizona.  These questions will be addressed:                  1) Do natural genotypes of B. subtilis differ in fitness?  2) Do                relative fitnesses of genotypes change as a function of biotic or               physical environmental conditions?  3) Is recombination frequency               correlated with specific habitat conditions?  4) Are genetically                variable soil populations of B. subtilis more resistant to                      bacteriophage predators than are monomorphic cultures?  5) Is                   there a genetic cost to sexual reproduction in B. subtilis?  The                basic procedure in these experiments will be to 1) inoculate soil               microcosms with heat-shock spores or vegetative cells of one or                 more isogenic strains of B. subtilis, 2) sample these populations               at intervals, 3) estimate the density of vegetative cells and                   spores, and 4) determine genotype/recombination frequencies by                  protein, antibiotic resistance, colony morph, and DNA                           restriction fragment polymorphisms.  Additionally, to address                   question 5 the PI will transform competent B. subtilis in broth                 culture using prepared donor DNA.  These results will illuminate                the relative costs, benefits, and ecological and evolutionary                   consequences of genetic recombination and diversity in a species                with a primitively asexual breeding system.",
