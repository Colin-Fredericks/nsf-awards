 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research described in this grant is to                     understand the transcriptional process for genes encoded on                     mitochondrial DNA in yeast.  A yeast mutant defective in                        transcription of subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase has been                    isolated.  Subunit II DNA of the mutant contains a single                       nucleotide change in the transcriptional promoter.  The mutation                apparently interferes with recognition of the sequence as a                     transcriptional promoter.  We have isolated nine revertants of                  the mutant which have recovered the ability to respire.  Some of                these revertants have not recovered normal growth rates so                      recovery of function cannot be the consequence of restoration of                the normal sequence but must involve compensatory changes.                      Classical genetic techniques will be used to determine if the                   compensatory changes are found on nuclear or mitochondrial DNA.                 For mitochondrial revertants, genetic mapping experiments will                  localize the specific region of mitochondrial DNA carrying the                  compensatory change.  The region will be sequenced and compared                 to the normal region to identify the specific alteration.  For                  nuclear revertants, the altered genes responsible for recovery of               function will be identified by fragmenting DNA from the                         revertant strains, cloning those fragments and introducing the                  clones into the original mutant.  Clones which restore                          respiration must contain the altered gene and will be molecularly               characterized to understand how restoration of function occurred.               Analysis of the revertants will provide information about other                 sequences able to function as promoters of yeast mitochondrial                  transcription and about other gene products required for the                    process.",
