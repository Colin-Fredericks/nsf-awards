 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to the National Academy of Science/National Research              Council Computer Science and Technology Board (CSTB) to convene a               study committee that brings together technology developers and users            to develop the specific research agenda necessary to support a                  national collaboratory.  Collaboratory, is the term for a complete              computer and communications support environment for remote and in               situ scientific investigation.  This includes access to distributed             data bases, remote control of instrumentation, and other features to            enable scientific work by teams of scientists not collocated with               each other or their scientific instruments.  The CSTB will identify             major scientific efforts that would significantly benefit from an               enhanced collaboration ability; it will assess the needs and                    requirements of these projects through a series of workshops                    involving both developers and potential users.  A report summarizing            the workshop findings and their implications for a national                     collaboratory research agenda will be prepared.  It is estimated                that the report will be available early in 1992.",
