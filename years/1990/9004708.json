 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spontaneous mutation in Drosophila melanogaster are frequently                  caused by insertions of retrotransposons.  Mutant phenotypes result             from insertions into both coding and noncoding regions, and the                 mutagenic effects caused by insertions into coding and noncoding                regions are not well understood.  Some phenotypes resulting from                retrotransposoninsertions can be reversed by extrangenic suppressor             and intragenic reversion mutations.  The long term objective of                 this study is to understand how these mobile elements disrupt the               expression of nearby genes and to elucidate the role of suppressors             in modulating the mutagenic activity of retrotransposons.  A                    suppressible mutation caused by insertion of the 412 element into               the vermilion (v) gene of Drosophila is being investigated.  In                 this case, the 412 element inserted into the 5' untranslated region             of the first exon, and transposable element sequences are almost                entirely eliminated from the mature RNA by splicing at sites near               the ends of 412.  Mutations at suppressor of sable (su(s)) cause                increased accumulation of nearly wild-type sized v transcripts.                 One objective of this proposal is to investigate the mechanism of               suppression.  The proposed experiments will define whether su(s)                mutations affect transcription, RNA stability or splicing.  Other               experiments will indicate whether specific 412 sequences interfere              with v RNA accumulation and are required for the response to su(s)              mutations or whether interference is due to the position of the 412             insertion.  A second objective is to investigate the mechanism of               intragenic reversion.  In one v revertant, a second retrotransposon             inserted into one end of the 412 element, altering the splicing                 pattern.  The proposed experiments will ascertain whether the                   secondary insertion significantly improves the rate of splicing to              remove transposon sequences.  If so, the effect of changes in                   splice sites on the response to su(s) mutations will be determined.                                                                                             These goals will be accomplished by examining levels of precursor               and mature v RNA produced by in vitro generated variants of the                 mutant and revertant alleles after transformation into the                      Drosophila germ line.***",
