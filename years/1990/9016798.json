 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of this work is to develop techniques to                      better evaluate the potential toxicity of chemicals to                          humans.  Currently, toxicological and pharmacological                           testing of chemicals requires large numbers of animals.                         Data obtained from whole animal studies are difficult to                        accurately extrapolate across species lines and to effects                      at low doses.  Basic metabolic interactions are difficult                       to monitor.  On both economic and ethical grounds it is                         desirable to reduce the number of animals utilized in such                      testing.  Advances in biotechnology and cell culture                            present an opportunity to develop alternative methods that                      can yield both better data and reduced use of animals.                                                                                                          This work will combine pharmokinetic models and in vitro                        cell culture techniques to construct a direct physical                          analog of the whole animal.  This concept will be tested                        by constructing a mouse analog - using two types of lung                        cells and hepatocytes from the liver.  Direct observations                      can be made of molecular level mechanisms for                                   biotransformations of xenobiotics.  Further incorporation                       of mechanistic information into the pharmokinetic model                         will allow extrapolation of observations.  Controversies                        on which cytochromes are responsible for bioactivation of                       napthalene and on which cell types are primarily                                responsible for its activation will be addressed.",
