 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of 8 U.S.                     scientists and engineers in a binational workshop on                            \"Advances in Construction Materials, Techniques, and                            Standards\" to be held in Madras, India in June 1990.  The                       workshop is aimed at affecting professional interaction                         between engineers, scientists and industry leaders in India                     and the U.S. to advance the research and application of                         construction materials.  Specifically it is proposed to:                        describe the systematic methods of construction, techniques                     used, and characteristic materials behavior in the U.S.                         practice; discuss potential applications of U.S. methods to                     India and other developing countries; project the future                        trends to determine research objectives and requirements for                    the next decade, and to focus Indian interest in potential                      cooperative research as related to construction material on a                   global basis.                                                                                                                                                   Scope:  The importance of low-cost, efficient and reliable                      housing is recognized by all countries and especially by Less                   Developed Countries (LDC's).  The objectives of this project,                   to provide a scientific basis for documentation of the                          state-of-the-art, and for research needs in this field, are                     relevant to both India and the U.S.  The U.S. P.I. has                          well-documented experience in research and teaching in the                      construction engineering field.  The Indian counterpart                         Dr. C.S. Krishnamoorthy is Head of the Structural Engineering                   Laboratory, of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.                      That Laboratory is active in this area of research with one                     cooperative research grant from NSF.  Additional support in                     India will come form the Structural Engineering Research                        Laboratory (SERC) of the council of Scientific and Industrial                   Research (CSIR).  The SERC in Madras is the best known Indian                   Laboratory in that field.",
