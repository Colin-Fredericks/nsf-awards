 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taxonomic understanding of the broad interrelationships of                 groups of flowering plants can both facilitate and constrain                    comparative study of the morphology, physiology, and ecology of                 plants.  Where taxa have been well sampled, deep knowledge of                   their evolutionary or genealogical relationships leads to                       fruitful comparisons of homologous structures or biochemical                    pathways or life-histories.  When the taxa are not well known,                  comparisons are often made between spuriously related forms, and                arguments may perpetuate endlessly over whether convergence or                  true evolutionary relationship accounts for the similarity in                   form or function under study.  Dr. Larry Hufford of the                         University of Minnesota has organized a large-scale symposium for               the Botanical Society of America meetings in Richmond, Virginia,                on the topic of the evolutionary relationships of the highly                    advanced dicots of the subclass Asteridae, including the                        sunflower, potato, and madder families, among the largest in the                world in numbers of species.                                                         Fourteen speakers, including four from Europe, will address                in turn morphological data, from living and fossil plants, and                  molecular data, from recent DNA analyses of these plants, to                    identify areas of agreement and disagreement in our understanding               of the phylogeny of Asteridae and to target projects necessary to               achieve resolution.  Plans have already been made for publication               of the meeting's deliberations, so the results will become widely               available to all interested botanists.",
