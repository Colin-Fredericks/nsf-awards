 "awd_abstract_narration": "The published record indicates that a multiplicity of fluids is                 involved in mantle processes leading to the formation of                        kimberlites and diamonds.  It is the purpose of the proposed work               to contribute to the clarification of the emerging very complex                 picture of diamond growth and mantle metasomatism.  In particular               the PI will attempt to trace the distribution and origin of                     highly 13C depleted mantle carbon further, following the leeds                  developed by the work carried out so far.                                       A major new thrust of the proposed work will be the examination                 of the oxygen isotope record of silicate in inclusions in                       diamonds and the carbon isotopic composition of the host.  The                  studies will be carried out on suites of samples for which an                   asthenospheric origin can be postulated as well as on diamonds                  which were formed at shallower levels.  The results of the work                 will provide an important constraint for hypotheses proposing                   subduction related origins of diamonds which were formed at 400                 to 500 km depth.                                                                It is also planned to delineate further the various mantle carbon               reservoirs that are presently under discussion, and to establish                the joint 813C and 818O record left by mantle metasomatic events.",
