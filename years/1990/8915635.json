 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will be carried out with very sensitive radio                receivers that will be installed at South Pole Station, Antarctica              and in one of the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) that                are being built for remote sites in Antarctica.  The receivers                  will operate in the low, middle and high frequency bands (150 kHz               to 9.6 MHz).  Waves with these frequencies are known to be                      produced by auroral activity, and have often been observed by                   rocket and satellite borne instruments.  Theoretical studies have               indicated that some of these emissions should be able to penetrate              the ionosphere and be detectable at ground level, while other                   emissions would not.  The purpose of this project is to test the                theoretical predictions and to provide insight into auroral                     emissions and wave propagation processes.  It is necessary to do                these measurements in Antarctica because only there would the                   receivers be sufficiently isolated from manmade radio                           interference.",
