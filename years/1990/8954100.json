 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal represents a pilot program for testing methods               of encouraging interest in scientific careers in minority                       children and their mothers. Two weekly biological science                       programs, one for children, the other for mothers, are being held               at the University of Hartford for three groups of Hartford inner-               city residents: public school third and fourth graders attending                alone; mothers of third and fourth graders attending alone; third               and fourth graders attending with their mothers. The                            effectiveness of these three approaches in improving attitudes                  toward science, scientific careers, and achievement in the                      children and in their mothers, and also in encouraging a desire                 in the mothers to seek further education and/or scientific                      employment is being compared. The content of the program is                     focused on physiology, anatomy, nutrition, and, for the                         children's program, experimentation. Guest speakers who serve as                role models for various scientific careers are included.",
