 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides 50% of the funding needed to construct                 five special design reaction vessels for use at high pressure and               temperature. The design, construction and operation of the                      pressure vessels will be under the direction of the Principal                   Investigator in the Division of Geological & Planetary Sciences                 at the California Institute of Technology. Caltech will provide                 the remaining 50% funding necessary for the project.                                 The proposed apparatus incorporates a novel feature whereby                the sample is magnetically levitated during an experiment and can               be rapidly moved into and out of the hot zone within the vessel                 without release of pressure. The vessels will be used in a wide                 variety of projects aimed at understanding the behavior of                      volatile components in natural and synthetic model igneous                      systems, including: investigations of the partitioning of                       hydrogen isotopes between vapor and silicate melts and its                      relation to the speciation of water in magmatic liquids; studies                of the solubility and diffusion of water and carbon dioxide in                  silicate glasses and melts; study of the partitioning of carbon                 isotopes between vapor and silicate melts.",
