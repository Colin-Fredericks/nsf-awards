 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between Alfred Anderson of the                  University of Chicago and Dork Sahagian of Ohio State.The main                  goal of the project is to establish whether gas accumulates                     beneath Kilauea's summit.  The idea is that gas accumulation at                 the structural apex can cause persistent localization of a summit               vent.  Additional goals are:  1) to use melt inclusions to                      establish the depths of olivine crystallization beneath Kilauea:                and 2) to confirm the initial bulk concentration of C02 and H20                 in Kilauean parent magma.  Subaerial and submarine Kilauean                     basalts will be studied.  Inclusions of glass in Olivine                        phenocrysts will be analyzed for major elements and S by electron               microprobe and for H20 and C02 by infra-red spectroscopy.  In                   addition the size, abundance and gas pressure of vesicles in                    glassy submarine basalts will be measured.  The sizes and gas                   pressures of gas bubbles in glass inclusions will be measured for               comparison with the vesicles in host glasses.  Calculations will                be performed to assess the coalescence and rate of rise of                      bubbles in the evolving body of magma beneath Kilauea.  The                     results will be compared with existing data on the historical                   rates of outgassing, magma influx, and eruption.  The data and                  computations will be used to test and refine existing models of                 the outgassing and evolution of Kilauea volcano.  Overall, the                  PIs will test the idea that Kilauea is a centralized volcano                    because rising gas seeks and maintain a vent at its summit.",
