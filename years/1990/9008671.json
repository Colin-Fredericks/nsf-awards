 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physiological                 ecology between  Drs. Ronald D. DeLaune and William H.                          Patrick, Center for Wetland Resources,  Louisiana State                         University and Dr. O. Van Cleemput, Faculty of Agricultural                     Sciences, University of Ghent, Belgium.   The project                           addresses the formation and consumption of biogenic gases in                    soils and seeks to define the conditions under which specific                   gases are formed, and the rates and conditions leading to                       their consumption.                                                                                                                                              The development of fully or partly anoxic conditions occurs                     in both waterlogged and in well drained soil conditions. A                      combination of high oxygen consumption through the presence                     of abundant, readily available carbon and limited oxygen                        supply induced by a high water content is the main reason for                   the onset of anaerobic conditions.  These conditions are                        responsible not only for stress to plants, but are also                         favorable for the formation of gaseous hydrocarbons, such as                    methane, ethylene, ethane, propane and butane.  These gases                     can have adverse effects on plants and can negatively                           influence the gaseous environment.  The aim of this project                     is to investigate to what extent soils or sediments can be a                    source for gaseous hydrocarbons.  Gaseous hydrocarbon                           production and evolution will be related to sediment Eh, pH                     and amendments, including different types of organic material.                  The investigations will be carried out in the laboratory, as                    well as in the field.  The results of this study are expected                   to provide a better understanding of the carbon cycle and to                    lead to added information on the composition of the gaseous                     environment in soils and sediment, including possible source-                   sink relationships with the atmosphere.                                         The research will benefit from the combined expertise of the                    US investigators in nutrient interactions and of the Belgian                    investigators in gaseous hydrocarbons and anaerobic soils.",
