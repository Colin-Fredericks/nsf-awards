 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU program will help ten students develop independent, creative           research skills and produce high-quality, publishable research in key           areas of chemical engineering.  The REU program will also provide               research mentors and role models who encourage the students to                  consider the pursuit of advanced degrees and careers in research.  The          program is also designed to help develop ties between regional                  chemical engineering programs to promote research and graduate school           as career options to undergraduates.  The recruiting focus will be on           students who are members of groups underrepresented in engineering              attending regional schools with undergraduate-oriented programs.                Students will work closely with faculty as integral parts of their              advisor' research groups on projects that are uniquely their own.               They will give regular oral progress reports to their peers, make a             formal presentation open to the public, and prepare a final report.             Weekly presentations by faculty members will expose students to a               range of career opportunities in research and several free-form                 brainstorming sessions will be held to promote creativity.",
