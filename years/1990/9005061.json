 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past studies have demonstrated substantial physiological                        similarities between invertebrate and vertebrate immunity.                      However, such functional similarities might also reflect the                    convergent evolution of otherwise unrelated systems.  Only                      detailed molecular comparisons will confirm true homology.  The                 long term goal of identifying and characterizing invertebrate                   recognition molecules is specifically designed to provide such                  molecular comparisons.  Urochordates represent the closest extant               ancestor of the chordates, and so have a substantial chance of                  yielding identifiable molecular homologies with vetebrate immune-               related molecules.  Monoclonal antibodies directed against                      urocordate cell surface antigens will be obtained and screened                  for their capacity to inhibit immunological reactivity in in                    vitro assays of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation.  Inhibitory                monoclonal antibodies will be used to purify putative recognition               molecules.  Unlike previous, unsuccessful investigations, this                  protocol does not assume that invertebrate recognition structures               share similarity with their vertebrate equivalents.  i.e. It does               not rely on the capacity of anti-vertebrate molecular probes to                 cross-react with invertebrate determinants, but should identify                 urochordate recognition structures in the context of their native               functions.                                                                                                                                                      This project aims to identify and characterize molecules that                   mediate immunological recognition among invertebrates.  Previous                analyses suggest that specific immunological recognition is not                 solely a vertebrate trait.  Many invertebrates exhibit adaptive                 histocompatibility responses that bear considerable similarity to               vertebrate immune reactions.  Indeed, it is postulated that the                 adaptive immune systems of higher (vertebrate) animals evolved                  directly from more primitive systems of recognition that are                    still expressed among advanced invertebrates.  If this hypothesis               proves to be true, invertebrates may assume an important role as                model systems for the analysis of fundamental imunological                      mechanisms that remain disguised by the complexity of vertebrate                systems.  However, before such invertebrate models can be applied               to the rationalization of complex problems, the evolutionary                    homology of vertebrate and invertebrate immunorecognition must be               examined.  The results of this research on the immunorecognition                structures in tunicates should make a substantial contribution                  toward this goal.",
