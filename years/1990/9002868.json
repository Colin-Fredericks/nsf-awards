 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the inverse problem in underwater                       acoustics and shows how it may be solved for the case of                        finite oceans with depth varying index of refraction.                           There are two difficulties which must be resolved.  The                         first has to do with the interaction of the ocean surface                       and bottom.  Preliminary computations and graphics show                         that this problem has been taken care of using our version                                                                                                      of the far-field function array.  For more resolution we                        propose using more propagating modes.  The procedure will                       require, however, an increased cpu time.  To take into                          account the effects of a variable index of refraction, we                       make use of transmutation, a procedure which relates                            solutions of complicated differential equations to simpler                      ones.  We have shown how, using transmutation, we may                           compute the \"perturbed modes\", and the propagating Green's                      function.  Initial computations with small wave number                          were promising.",
