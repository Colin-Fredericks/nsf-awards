 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbial inoculants, in particular fluorescent pseudomonads,                   have been used to control a variety of plant pathogens, both                    bacterial and fungal. Currently there is a strong impetus to                    promote research and commercialize these biological control                     agents due to increased environmental and health concerns over                  synthetic pesticide use. However, while scientific interest and                 effort in microbial pesticides is considerable, there remain many               limitations for their use and effectiveness. Some of these                      limitations are the difficulty of use over a diversity of crops                 and limited knowledge of spatial and temporal distribution of a                 root system with respect both to colonization and expression of                 antifungal compounds. This proposal is directed towards defining                the range of hosts supporting the production of an antifungal                   compound, oomycin A, expressed by Pseudomonas fluorescens strain                Hv37a and toward identifying the effect of constitutive                         expression of the antifungal compound over that host range. This                proposal is also intended to determine the timing, the site(s),                 and the influence of wounding of roots on expression of oomycin A               of a selected host. This information will be used to help                       identify opportunities for generic modification of the regulation               of antifungal compound(s) for controlling specific types of                     pathogens of those hosts.                                                       %%%                                                                             The long range goal of this work is the development of                          consistently effective microbial pesticides for protection                      against soilborn plant pathogens as a less toxic alternative to                 synthetic pesticides.",
