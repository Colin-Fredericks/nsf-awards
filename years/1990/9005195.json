Specifically,                     elongation factors from c. coli and from calf brain will be                     studied both in isolated forms and in complexes with                            appropriate components from their respective protein                            biosynthesis systems.  In the case of the E. coli protein, the                  complexes will be the guanine nucleotide bound forms, the                       heterodimer formed with still another elongation factor, the                    ternary complex formed with guanine nucleotide and                              aminoacylated-tRNA and the complex formed with the antibiotic                   aurodox.  The elongation factor from calf brain will also be                    studied in its complexes with guanine nucleotides and with                      other elongation factors.  The goal of these studies will be                    to examine the nature and extent of the conformational                          alterations which occur upon formation of these various                         biologically important complexes as well as to elucidate                        hydrodynamic aspects of the complexes.  In addition to                          providing information on these important components of protein                  biosynthesis systems the proposed studies will also have                        relevance to related research on other quinine nucleotide                       binding proteins.",
