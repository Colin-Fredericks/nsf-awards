 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Italy award will support an interdisciplinary                         meeting in Manziana, Italy on the topic of copper in biological                 systems.  The meeting, organized by Professor Jack Peisach of                   the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University                   and Professor Bruno Mondovi of the University of Rome \"La                       Sapienza,\" will include 15 participants from twelve countries                   besides the U.S. and Italy.  The emphasis will be on non-blue                   copper oxidases, although sessions devoted to blue copper,                      hemocyanin, cytochrome oxidase, and the role of copper in                       toxicity and detoxification mechanisms will be included.                                                                                                        Copper plays a vital role in biological systems.  It is an                      essential transition metal required for enzymatic reactions,                    bioenergetic processes, and for structural integrity of some                    proteins.  In excess, it can be toxic, both through its role                    as a heavy metal intoxicant, but also in reactions that                         generate toxic oxygen species.  Considering the importance                      of biological copper systems, it is not surprising that they                    remain under vigorous investigation in numerous laboratories                    throughout the United States, Italy, and other parts of the                     world.  Although the topic has been discussed at various                        scientific meetings, the Manzania meetings have been                            exceptional for the breadth of their multidisciplinary approach                 and their specific focus on copper research.  The introduction                  of several important techniques in the field can be traced                      back to the impact of past Manzania meetings.  In addition to                   acting as a clearing house for a multidisciplinary approach,                    the Manzania meetings have provided a nurturing scientific                      environment for young investigators.  In the five years since                   the last Manziana meeting, the direction of the field has                       changed considerably and new approaches and understanding of                    the role of metals in biology make the case for a meeting on                    this topic.",
