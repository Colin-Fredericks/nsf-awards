 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Jackson Laboratory will initiate a nine-week, residential, Young            Scholars project in the life sciences for students in the 11th grade.                                                                                           Continuing an annual tradition begun in 1949, high school juniors               conduct independent, original research in mammalian genetics as                 apprentices in staff scientists' laboratories during a summer program.          This full-time, at-the-bench experience is supplemented by evening              research presentations by sponsors (preceptors) and students, and by a          weekly discussion series on careers and ethical issues in genetics.             High-ability students, recruited on a national basis, are accepted.             Each participant's project is tailored to his or her academic                   preparation and interests.  Inbred and mutant lines of mice are used in         many of the student projects.  Follow-up activities include contact             among the sponsor, the student, and a Key Teacher at the student's              school.  Program alumni include two Nobel Laureates, as well as a               Westinghouse Science winner.",
