 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to its potential for high reliability and high performance, a               carefully designed distributed system can make an ideal controller for          real-time applications.  However, the main drawback of a distributed            system is that the communication latency between tasks executing on two         different nodes can be fairly large.  This research is to improve the           communication performance by addressing the problems related to message         passing in a distributed system with point-to-point interconnection             topology.                                                                                                                                                       First, the assignment of deadlines to messages based on the deadlines           of related tasks is formalized.  Message passing techniques are then            developed that have higher probabilities of messages meeting their              assigned deadlines.  Since, by the first objective, the deadlines have          been assigned in a proper manner, the new message passing techniques            result in a better communication mechanism between the real-time tasks.                                                                                         Our approach is to first characterize the probability distribution              function of message delivery times.  Using this distribution, the               deadlines for messages from the deadlines of related tasks will then be         derived.  Finally, use will be made of the multiple disjoint paths in           a distributed system to increase the probability of a message meeting           its assigned deadline.",
