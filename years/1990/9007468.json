 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gas-solid reactions with solid product are encountered in a                     number of chemical process industries with applications                         ranging from ceramic material manufacture to gas scrubbing for                  pollution control.  Because of the formation of the solid                       product, a number of  other  processes must be considered in                    the study of this type of reactions in addition to mass and                     heat transport and chemical reaction.  Most of these processes                  are related to the evolution of the morphology of the solid                     because of the formation of the solid product and the                           diffusion of the reactive species through the formed layer of                   solid product.  If the solid product occupies                                   stoichiometrically more volume than the solid reactant from                     which it results, phenomena of pore plugging and, as a result,                  incomplete conversion may arise.  Since pores of different                      size are expected to be plugged at different times - the                        smaller the pores, the earlier they will be plugged - the                       transient behavior of the reacting particles should in general                  depend not only on the average structural properties of the                     porous calcined solid (i.e, internal surface area and                           porosity) but on the form of the pore size distribution as                      well, even under reaction conditions characterized by                           negligible intraparticle concentration gradients.  In the                       presence of significant intraparticle diffusion limitations,                    the overall picture of a gas-solid reaction with pore closure                   behavior becomes considerably more complex.  If the reaction                    rate at the external surface of the particles is much higher                    than that in the interior, complete pore closure may take                       place at the external surface while there is still open space                   left in the interior.  Such an event can lead to ultimate                       conversions much lower than those predicted by the                              stoichiometry of the reaction for complete plugging of the                      internal space.  Based on these observations,  the PIs are                      experimentally studying gas-solid reactions with solid                          product.                                                                                                                                                        This equipment grant is for an automated laboratory system                      capable of determining the physical microstructure of any                       solid material.  It is to be used to elucidate the effects of                   processing conditions on the microstructural properties of                      solid products and reactants and their effects on the behavior                  of  gas-solid reaction systems.  Specifically the equipment is                  an automated mercury porosimeter with appropriate hardware and                  software for data acquisition and analysis.  The system will                    be used to analyze solid samples for a number of experimental                   projects involving powders and porous media including:  (1)                     reactions of metal oxides with hydrogen sulfide and sulfur                      dioxide employed to control pollutant emissions from coal                       utilization systems, (2) densification of porous preforms in                    manufacturing ceramic matrix composites by chemical vapor                       infiltration, and (3) characterization of powders and powder                    compacts (fresh or partially sintered) involved in the                          fabrication of metal and ceramic composites using powdered                      material techniques.",
