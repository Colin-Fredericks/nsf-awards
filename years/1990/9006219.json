 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue his               numerical analysis of scalar hyperbolic equations in one space                  dimension, in order to derive improved error bounds and to extend               his techniques to systems of such equations in higher space                     dimensions.  In particular, he will employ Besov space                          approximation theory to develop an improved regularity theory for               scalar conservation laws that is applicable to moving mesh                      numerical methods.  He will also attempt to extend moving mesh                  finite element methods to systems of equations by providing a                   theoretical justification for some practical moving mesh                        algorithms in current use.  There are many methods available                    today for the numerical solution of a single partial differential               equation in one space variable, but only a precious few of these                methods can be used to solve systems of such equations in more                  than one space variable.  One reason for this is that many                      methods lack a solid theoretical foundation.  With this award the               principal investigator will continue developing theoretical                     justifications for certain numerical schemes in the hope that                   better schemes for higher-dimensional systems can be found.",
