 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iridaceae are a moderately large family of monocots of some                92 genera and 1620 species distributed mainly in the southern                   hemisphere.  One of the few larger monocot families so far                      investigated in any detail, it is becoming a model example of the               patterns of geographic radiation, adaptation, and evolution in                  the monocots.  The proposed research by Dr. Peter Goldblatt of                  the Missouri Botanical Garden consists of a basic taxonomic                     revision of the tropical African species of Gladiolus and                       Radinosiphon.  Gladiolus, largest genus of subfamily Ixioideae,                 comprises some 185 species of which 112 are southern African, ca.               60 occur in tropical Africa and Madagascar, and 20 species are                  spread through southern Europe, the Mediterranean basin, and                    Middle East.  Neither genus has been thoroughly studied since                   1898 and together they constitute the last significant genera of                African Iridaceae for which there are no modern synthetic                       treatments available, this despite the obvious horticultural                    importance of Gladiolus and considerable confusion over the                     delimitation of species and their correct names.                                     Field collecting and herbarium study will yield                            morphological and chromosomal characters useful in species                      recognition and comparison.  Gladiolus is of particular interest                geographically as it is one of few genera distributed throughout                southern and tropical Africa that has radiated significantly both               in the tropics, in temperate southern Africa, and in the winter                 rainfall area of the southwest coast of South Africa.  The                      establishment of a soundly based taxonomy for the genus will make               it possible to compare patterns of evolution over its entire                    range and to identify centers of endemism and speciation on the                 African continent.",
