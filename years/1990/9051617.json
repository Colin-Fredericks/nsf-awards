 "awd_abstract_narration": "An instructional laboratory for the teaching of intermediate and                project-oriented courses in Computer Science (CPS) and Industrial               and Engineering Technology (IET) has been established.  As a result             CPS students are able to get a concrete feeling for abstract                    concepts introduced in the Data Structures and AI and Machine                   Learning courses through the medium of programming robotic                      effectors.  These effectors can be used to move chess pieces on a               board for example.  Students are able to better grasp abstract                  concepts through the generalization of their experiences in the                 laboratory.  Similarly, IET students are afforded the opportunity               to acquire knowledge of how to apply AI techniques in solving                   factory scheduling and other related problems.  Moreover, the                   affected courses fosters greater interaction among CPS and IET                  students and their departmental faculty.  This interaction is                   crucial to successful teaching and student research.  It is also                a positive inducement towards the attraction of new majors from                 within the university community.  The award is being matched by an              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
