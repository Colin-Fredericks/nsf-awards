 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is believed that visual perception occurs largely based on                   interactions of nerve cells, or neurons, in the visual cortex of                the brain.  The visual cortex itself is a structure composed of                 several layers of different classes on neurons.  These classes                  are distinguished by the shape of the cells, their connections,                 their response to particular patterns of light stimulation or                   motion or color, and by the chemicals called neurotransmitters                  that the neurons secrete at their functional connections, called                synapses.  Two important neurotransmitters of a group called                    mono-amines are known as NE (norepinephrine) and 5-HT (5-hydroxy-               tryptamine).  The pathways for neurons in the brain to the cells                they innervate are fairly well known for both these compounds,                  and monoamines are known to modulate activity in several neural                 systems.  The equipment provided will allow a new approach to                   understanding modulation of cortical activity.  The study is a                  preliminary effort to determine at the level of single cells in                 the well-described layers of the primate visual cortex, how                     information processing is modulated by the similarly layered and                specifically connected neurons secreting monoamines.  Highly                    controlled visual stimuli will be used to excite visual cortical                cells, and when the responses are characterized, highly localized               pharmacological applications of monoamines will be made by                      microelectrode.  Changes in visual properties attributable to the               monoamines which are specific to a cell class, lamina, or                       cortical area may be described in terms of their potential                      significance for perception and behavior.  This work will have                  impact on psychology of arousal and attention, as well as on                    visual and sensory neuroscience, and provide a novel bridge                     between these communities.",
