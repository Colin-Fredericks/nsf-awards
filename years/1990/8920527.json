 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the composition and chemistry of the oceanic crust                has been a long term goal of the marine geosciences. Such                       information provides important constraints on the processes that                transfer mantle material to the crust, that lead to the formation               of the igneous crust, and that subsequently modify the chemistry                of the crust and control the composition of seawater. Such an                   understanding, however, requires a means to sample crustal rock                 and a way to relate individual crustal layers to over- and                      underlying strata. Although deep crustal drilling is one such                   technique, deep crustal holes are expensive and provide limited                 areal sampling of crustal material. Recently there has been                     renewed interest in studying faulted crustal exposures as a way                 to sample a stratigraphic succession of crustal rocks by                        submersible/dredging or by a series of shallow drill holes.                                                                                                     The present award will undertake a side-scan sonar survey of                    exposed crustal rocks in the Kane Transform Fault in the north                  Atlantic. Objectives of the project are to map the continuity of                crustal layers, to sample the stratigraphic succession of igneous               rocks exposed along the transform, and to examine the faulting                  pattern exposed along major scarps. These data will be used to                  determine both the history of crustal accretion and subsequent                  deformation. Additionally, these data will provide the needed                   survey for subsequent submersible research in the area. The                     project is a cooperative study between scientists at the                        University of Washington, Duke University and the University of                 Paris.",
