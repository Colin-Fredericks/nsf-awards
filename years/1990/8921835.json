 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to develop and analyze efficient algorithms               for a variety of standard network flow problems.  The algorithms                are to be analyzed from both empirical and theoretical points of                view.  Comparison measures used to evaluate the algorithms are                  worst case performance, average case performance and empirical                  performance based on computational experiments.  Both sequential                and parallel algorithm implementation is to be investigated.  One               of the major tools to be used is scaling, solving a sequence of                 problems that are closer and closer to the original problem and                 reoptimization of the solution of the previous problem is used to               solve the next problem.                                                           Important new results to impact the current state-of-the-art                  knowledge and improve the technology base in network flow theory                should prove successful in this research.",
