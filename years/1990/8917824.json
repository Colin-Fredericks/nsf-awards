 "awd_abstract_narration": "The liver bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-               2,6-bisphosphatase has been isolated and characterized by a                     number of biophysical and biochemical methods.  The PI has                      determined its protein and cDNA sequence and has shown that the                 enzyme is composed of two independent domains: a NH2-terminal                   kinase domain and a COOH-terminal bisphosphatase domain.  The                   latter is structurally and functionally homologous to the                       phosphoglycerate mutase/acid phosphatase family.  Recent                        structural analysis of the 2-kinase domain has revealed a                       structural homology with 6-phosphofructo-1-kinases.  It is                      planned to use structural information and biochemical approaches                as well as methods of site specific mutagenesis to extend                       knowledge of the mechanisms involved in 6PF-2-K catalysis.  Four                questions will be studied:                                                           1)  Based on structural information to employ site directed                mutagenesis at the site of the hypothesized nucleotide binding                  fold of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase in order to confirm its role in                ATP binding.                                                                         2)  To determine the role of several; cysteinyl residues                   which have been implicated from protein modification experiments                as being important in the 2-kinase reaction.                                         3)  To determine the anomeric specificity of the 6-PF-2-K                  reaction.                                                                            4)  Based on comparison of the topological structure of 6PF-               1-K and that predicted for 6PF-2-K to alter residues responsible                for Fru 6-P binding.                                                                 The effects of substitutions will be studied by measuring                  aspects of enzyme activity, Fru 6-P and ATP affinity, spectral                  properties, and protein structure.",
