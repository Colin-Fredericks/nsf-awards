 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is being funded by the Synthetic Organic                  Chemistry Program.  Dr. Pearson will develop new synthetic                      reagents based upon transition metal-olefin complexes.  These                   complexes facilitate the construction of complicated ring                       systems found in the materials used by modern agriculture.                                                                                                      This research revolves around the use of polyolefin-transition                  metal complexes as reactive intermediates for the construction                  of quaternary carbon centers.  The methodology developed during                 these studies is to be applied in total synthesis of a number                   of biologically active terpenoid natural products.                              Cyclohexadienyliron complexes are to be used in the synthesis                   of trichothecenes such as trichodermol and verrucarol, and in                   synthesis of the diterpenoids stemodinone and aphidicolin.                      Each of these classes of compound show antibacterial,                           antifungal and/or antiviral activity.  Newly discovered                         reactions of dienyl- and diene iron complexes, in which a                       pendant olefin is coupled to the organometallic unit in a                       carbon-carbon bond forming process are to be studied in detail.                 The scope and synthetic applications of these and related                       reactions will be investigated.  A new approach to the                          synthesis of taxane derivatives will be investigated.  These                    compounds, in particular taxol, show exceptional promise as                     antitumor agents.  The synthetic approach described in this                     proposal aims to set in place the major part of the carbon                      skeleton via the reaction of a highly substituted tin enolate                   with tricarbonyl(l,3-dimethyl-4-methoxycyclohexadienyl)iron                     hexafluorophosphate, followed by an internal pinacol reaction                   to set in place the eight-membered ring.",
