 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many questions have been raised in recent years about the values                that influence the conduct of scientists and engineers in their                 professional work, about the sources of uncertainty and strain                  that may be altering those values, and about what does or should                constitute the normative content of graduate education.                         Questions such as these have stimulated work in professional                    ethics and ethics and value studies more generally, and have                    contributed to a revival of interest in the university's ethical                climate and responsibilities and its role in the moral                          development of students.  The objective of this project is to                   provide a data-based examination of the professional values being               acquired by graduate students in science and engineering,                       including an analysis of the value conflicts and ethical problems               encountered during their education.  The investigators will                     address this goal by developing and administering a national                    survey to graduate students and faculty in four disciplines at                  major departments.  They will also conduct field research case                  studies in those departments in two research universities.  The                 disciplines that will be studied in this phase of the project are               civil engineering, experimental psychology, geology and                         microbiology.  An advisory group and consultants provide                        oversight of the project.  Dissemination is expected to include                 information items in the project's newsletter and in co-sponsors'               publications (i.e., American Scientist, CGS Communicator, and                   Science); presentations to professional meetings; invitational                  lectures and seminars at various universities; articles in                      professional and scholarly journals; and a monograph.                                                                                                           This study grows out of the successful completion of a planning                 phase, which resulted in a bibliography, several papers accepted                for publication or presentation at professional meetings, several               exploratory case studies, and a survey of academic graduate                     school deans which presents the first systematic data about                     university policies and practices affecting values and values                   training in the graduate education of scientists and engineers.                 The co-principal investigators are very well-qualified;                         institutional support and student and post-doctoral assistance                  are appropriate; the research plans are good and should provide                 rich data about societal and departmental impacts on the                        professed values of science and engineering graduate students.                  Results will be widely disseminated and relevant to both                        researchers and educational policymakers.  Support is                           recommended.",
