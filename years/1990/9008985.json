 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydra is the most primitive metazoan possessing a nervous system.               This multicellular animal has been a favorite model for                         developmental studies, yet electrophysiological studies are                     practically non-existent.  For a number of technical reasons the                application of traditional electrophysiological techniques using                hydrozoans have proven to be quite difficult and overall not                    successful.  This study will examine the properties of                          dissociated Hydra neurons by utilizing the technique of patch                   clamping.  This microelectrode technique permits the recording of               ion channels from cells too small that would not be possible with               traditional electrophysiological methods.  The effects of a                     putative neurotransmitter on whole cell ionic currents and single               channels activity of hydra nerve and epithelial cell membranes                  will be studied.  Results from this study will provide additional               information on membrane function and physiology of chemical                     transmission in hydra cells.",
