 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will address novel neural network                                  models,for distributed stochastic operations.                                   Distributed stochastic operations arise in a number                             of interesting systems, such as: (1) Multisensor target                         tracking, (2) Distributed and hierarchical decision                             making in organization structures, (3) Distributed and                          cooperative computer data processing, and (4) Global                            forecasting of economy factors in complex distributed                           systems.  The neural network modeling of such                                   systems is highly important, since it can dictate                               appropriate operations to be executed and important                             factors to be extracted and communicated, for                                   effective system operation with simultaneously                                  reduced complexity.  Such modeling may also assist in                           the understanding of the basic elementary features                              and processes in complex systems as the above.                                                                                                                  The P.I. considers neural network structures whose                              objective is either hypothesis testing or parameter                             estimation.  She will test specific approaches for the                          design and analysis of such networks, with                                      performance criteria matching to the environment the                            network operates in and its objectives.                                                                                                                         The P.I. will also investigate new adaptive network                             training algorithms, with superior robustness and                               convergence characteristics.  These algorithms                                  outperform far the popular Least Mean Squares                                   (LMS) algorithm, using error criteria that are more                             relevant than the minimum mean square error for the                             classification of patterns.",
