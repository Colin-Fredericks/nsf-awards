 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corporations are responsible for a significant fraction of hedging              volume on futures and options markets, but there is as yet no                   satisfactory rigorous theory that explains why financial hedging                by corporations takes place.  The contribution from this project                comes from developing a theory of corporate financial hedging based             on agency costs.  This theory will provide insights into the                    interrelations between information, managerial compensation                     schemes, the selection of investment projects, and corporate                    financial hedging.                                                                                                                                              The project also addresses the foundations of financial economic                theory.  Asset pricing theory depends on a restrictive model of                 intertemporal preferences for the analysis of financial dynamics.               Specifically, individual intertemporal preferences are assumed to               be additively separable.  The investigator pioneered in his                     previous work the use of Stochastic Differential Utility (SDU) as               a model of preferences for consumption processes in a continuous-               time setting.  This project provides further elaboration of the SDU             preference model, the establishment of conditions for the existence             of market equilibrium in settings with heterogeneous agents, and                applications to asset pricing theory.",
