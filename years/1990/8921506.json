 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research builds off a previous NSF grant which demonstrated                that the seasonal variation in macroeconomic activity in the U.S.               and other economies displays striking similarities to business                  cycle variations.  It also shows that those countries or                        industries that display the greatest amount of seasonal variation               are also the ones that display the greatest amount of business                  cycle variation.  A plausible explanation for these results is                  that the same propagation mechanism is operative in producing                   seasonal and business cycle variation, even if the ultimate                     sources of the two kinds of fluctuations are quite different.                   The results from prior work thus suggests that it is important to               undertake an integrated analysis, including analysis of the                     welfare implications of seasonal variation.                                                                                                                     The purpose of this project is to begin developing such an                      analysis.  The first part of the project will develop a model of                production and inventory decision-making at the level of the firm               that can account for the cross-sectional correlations between the               amounts of seasonal and cyclical variation found in the data.  In               the second part, the welfare implications of the Federal                        Reserve's policy of ameliorating the seasonal fluctuations in                   interest rates will be examined.  The third part of the study                   compares the welfare consequence of seasonal cycles and business                cycles, and the fourth part involves the construction of a new                  monthly, seasonally-unadjusted index of industrial production for               the period 1884 to 1940.",
