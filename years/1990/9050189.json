 "awd_abstract_narration": "I propose to convene 12 teachers from 9 states to produce a high school         electricity curriculum that engages students in hands-on experimentation        to counteract misconceptions.  Our strategy employs transient lamp              lighting controlled by high-tech capacitors to reveal the physics of            current propulsion.  This stimulates students invent all required               circuit concepts in highly intuitive form, including a pressure-like            version of electric potential.                                                                                                                                  We plan to write and evaluate the effectiveness of three instructional          aids:                                                                                                                                                           INTRODUCTORY WORKSHOP GUIDE -- to acquaint teachers with new                    instructional opportunities made possible by capacitor-controlled lamp          lighting experiments.                                                           CLASSROOM RESOURCES BOOK -- to provide teachers with many useful                experiments, duplicatable materials and teaching strategies in easily           accessible format.                                                              BACKGROUND INFORMATION FILE -- to provide professional depth in areas of        apparatus characteristics, misconceptions research and history of               concepts.                                                                                                                                                       These materials will enhance the teacher's own understanding of electric        circuits and make study of electricity enjoyable for students.  They            will help students construct visualizable models and learn to reason            effectively with electric potential.  We anticipate a salutary effect on        students' preparedness for university courses in science and                    engineering, and on comprehension of electricity concepts by those who          enter the work force directly from school.",
