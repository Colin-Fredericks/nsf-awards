The                            Institute will consist of three main parts:  1) A three                         credit-hour course in organismal biology, including lectures,                   lab work and work designed to train teachers in field                           techniques; the areas covered will include behavior, ecology,                   physiology, and environmental biology.  Concepts from                           evolutionary biology will be used to integrate the separate                     elements.  Methods to teach evolution will be covered in                        detail.  2) Lectures and field trips designed to introduce                      other subjects and more Cornell faculty and resources to the                    participants.  3) A set of laboratory exercises designed to                     be taken back to the participants classrooms.                                                                                                                   Goals of the program include increasing teacher knowledge of                    organismal biology, dissemination of new teaching materials                     to enhance biology laboratory teaching, and development of a                    teacher network and a Cornell extension system for continuing                   activities.  Novel aspects include the use of computers for                     teaching and communication, increased use of Cornell as                         resource, and the cooperative development of new teaching                       laboratories with the participants.                                                                                                                             An amount equivalent to 40% of the NSF award is being                           contributed as cost-sharing.",
