 "awd_abstract_narration": "From the very beginnings of medieval thought about the year                     1200 until 1687, the year Isaac Newton published his                            monumental Principia, the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic geocentric                     cosmology dominated intellectual debate about the nature of                     our universe.  Professor Grant is examining how the                             Aristotelian system managed to persist for nearly half a                        millennium.  To understand this phenomenon is to understand                     the ability of received views to persist, even in the light                     of contradictory evidence.  Or, better, to understand the                       persistence of the Aristotelian system is to understand how                     a scientific theory can adapt to accommodate new views and to                   understand how extraordinarily difficult it is to overthrow                     entrenched views.  By undertaking this study, Professor Grant                   is thus shedding light on one of the most important issues in                   science studies:  how science changes--and why it does not                      change.                                                                                                                                                         Professor Grant has found that the nearly 500 year period can                   be divided into two parts: 1200-1500 when the Aristotelian                      view was overwhelmingly dominant and had no viable rivals.                      The second phase from 1500-1687 was one in which a number of                    rival cosmologies appeared ranging from the Platonic views to                   those of the hermetic tradition of Hermes Trismagistus.  He                     has found that, even if Copernicus had never written De                         revolutionibus, a significant debate about the earth's                          possible axial rotation and orbital motion would have                           occurred.  Yet in 1543, Copernicus did publish his                              revolutionary views and the remaining century and a half of                     Aristotelian cosmology was one of trying to accommodate the                     Aristotelian system to the discoveries which emerged in the                     16th and 17th centuries--from Brahe's new observations of the                   planets and stars to Galileo's telescopic discoveries.  The                     results of Professor Grant's study will be a massive history                    of Aristotelian cosmology.  This study will have major                          importance for studies in the history and the philosophy of                     science which are concerned with the central issues of                          scientific change.",
