 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will involve the formulation, analysis and                   computational solution of several fundamental mathematical models               of production and inventory systems.  Two critical managerial                   issues will be addressed:  (1) Inventory control in a fluctuating               environment.  This topic includes inventory management for products             subject to technological obsolescence and for new products,                     accounting for supply uncertainties, and coping with fluctuating                interest rates.  New models and new methods will be developed to                handle these pervasive phenomena.  (2) Coordination of procurement              and production activities.  Here focus is on the problems arising               from the need to manage many different products in concert and from             two additional sources of complexity, uncertain demands and                     capacity limits.  Specifically, methods will be developed for                   managing the joint procurement of multiple products under uncertain             demand, and for production scheduling when several products share               a group of machines.",
