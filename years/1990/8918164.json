 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will try to answer basic questions about how                 populations of organisms evolve.  Two closely related species,                  Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, will be studied                because they are easy to rear in the laboratory and because a                   great deal is known about them.  The most common procedure to be                used will be obtaining the sequence of the DNA of genes in                      several individuals from both of these species.  The sequences of               six different genes will be studied.                                                 By comparing DNA sequences it will be clear how different                  these two species are at the DNA level as well as how different                 individuals from the same species are at the DNA level.  These                  data will be compared to mathematical models of the evolutionary                process.  If the data fit the models well, then the models can be               very useful for asking questions about how natural selection                    affects the amount of DNA divergence seen between individuals and               between species.  If the data fit the models poorly, then our                   understanding of evolution that produced the models is incorrect,               and the models must be revised.",
