 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Blumenschine, Professor of                    Anthropology at Rutgers University, Mr. Salvatore Capaldo will                  conduct actualistic studies in the Serengeti region of Northern                 Tanzania.  The data thus collected will provide the basis for his               doctoral dissertation.  Following an already completed pilot                    study, he will collect information on carnivore modification of                 bone.  The results will be of direct use in interpreting                        archaeological assemblages.  Mr. Capaldo will obtain carcasses of               large mammals which have been collected by park officials.  These               will then be processed in a variety of ways which attempt to                    mimic prehistoric butchering patterns.  The bones will then be                  exposed to predation by hyenas and other carnivores and the                     resultant remains then collected and analyzed.  Unmodified bones                will also be treated in the same way to serve as a control                      sample.                                                                                                                                                         On this basis, it will be possible to examine important                         archaeological assemblages from East Africa to determine the                    extent to which they have resulted from human, as opposed to                    carnivore, activity.  In recent years, archaeologists have                      strongly disagreed about the role of hunting in the development                 of human society.  It has been argued that faunal assemblages                   found with early stone tools represent not hunting - as formerly                believed - but rather human scavenging from carnivore kills.  It                has proven extremely difficult to decide between these                          alternatives, and actualistic work, such as that which Mr.                      Capaldo will undertake, should serve to provide a needed                        interpretive context.                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                develop a methodological tool which will be applicable to many                  sites in different parts of the world.  It will ultimately                      increase our understanding of how humans developed and, finally,                will assist in the training of an extremely promising scientist.",
