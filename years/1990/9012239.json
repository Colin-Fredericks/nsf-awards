Preliminary findings indicate that                      glucose effects on the brain appear to interact with central                    nervous system neurotransmitter actions.  In particular, glucose                effects are somewhat analogous to those of brain acetylcholine                  agonists and opiate antagonists.  This research project examines                the pharmacological bases by which modest increases in                          circulating glucose levels alter memory and other brain                         functions.  One set of experiments will attempt to demonstrate                  that direct brain injections of small amounts of glucose have                   effects on the brain similar to those observed after increases of               blood glucose levels.  Such findings would support the view that                behavioral effects of increases in circulating glucose levels                   reflect direct glucose actions on the central nervous system.  A                second set of experiments will compare glucose effects with those               of opiate antagonists, to explore the analogous actions of these                treatments.  Further experiments will examine the interactions of               glucose with specific central acetylcholine systems to begin                    identification of anatomical loci of glucose actions on the                     brain.  Together, the experiments in this project will provide                  additional characterization of the mechanisms by which relatively               small changes in blood glucose levels regulate the functions of                 the brain.",
