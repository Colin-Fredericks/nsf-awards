 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin-film heat treatment by means of lasers is of growing                       importance to current microchip technology because it enables                                                                                                   the fabrication of novel electronic devices of high                             performance and improved circuit packing density.  In                           particular, the use of lasers to melt and recrystallize thin                    semiconductor layers has attracted great research interest due                                                                                                  to its potential for improving the electrical properties of                     the semiconductor.  This proposal presents a three-prong                        approach to the study of the heat transfer of radiatively                       induced crystal growth in thin semiconductor films:  i.                         Measurement of thin film optical properties at high                             temperatures up to the melting point; ii. Development of                        nonintrusive experimental methods for in-situ temperature                       measurement based on surface radiative data; iii. Construction                                                                                                  of numerical algorithms for simulation of the associated phase                                                                                                  change process.  The general goal of the program is to                          understand an quantify the effects of coupled light absorption                                                                                                  and thermal diffusion in polycrystalline thin films.                                                                                                            The proposed program is expected to make a substantial                          contribution to the knowledge base on a very important but not                                                                                                  adequately understood solidification/melting problem and could                                                                                                  lead to important process control technology.  In addition,                     this work will provide new quantitative information on little                                                                                                   known properties of thin films which may lead to new                            developments in the semiconductor industry.",
