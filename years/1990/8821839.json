 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty members and students at the University of Florida are                   contributing efforts to understand what are perhaps the most                    enigmatic objects in the Universe -- the remote quasars and                     related active galaxies.  The ultimate objective is to comprehend               the process that allows a quasar, within a volume comparable to                 that of our tiny Solar System, to generate 100 times the energy                 of a huge galaxy such as the Milky Way.  Solution of this mystery               undoubtedly will contribute greatly to our understanding of the                 development of the galaxies themselves.  Because the study of                   variability has long been recognized as a powerful tool in                      attacking astrophysical problems, we regularly follow the                       unpredictable changes in brightness of over 220 quasars and                     active galaxies, using the 76-cm telescope of the University's                  Rosemary Hill Observatory.  Much of our work is carried on in                   collaboration with other observatories and with scientists using                spacecraft such as the International Ultraviolet Explorer and the               Japanese x-ray satellite GINGA.  Future collaborations involve                  experiments to be carried by the Space Shuttle.  Photographic                   research initiated to support the quasar observations has                       resulted in innovative methods of increasing photographic                       sensitivity that have been adopted world-wide; as an illustration               of \"spin-off\" from basic research, these methods are now being                  employed in biomedical radiography and in industrial and                        biomedical microscopy.  A new CCD camera will be built and used                 for observations.",
