 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposal attempts to obtain information on the                    transient radiation characteristics of strongly radiating                       flames.  The authors have noted that previous attempts at                       predicting emission temperatures, absorption coefficients, and                                                                                                  radiative heat fluxes for such flames have been in                              considerable error, and they propose that the cause of this                     may be due to the misinterpretation of data which includes                      both spatial variations and temporal variation.  Previous                       analyses have not attempted to separate these effects.                          However, the authors presented ample evidence to indicate                       that, because of the high level of turbulence in the flames of                                                                                                  interest, temporal fluctuations are indeed present.                                                                                                             The approach is a coordinated experimental/analytical study.                                                                                                    The experimental program is innovative and ambitious.  It will                                                                                                  attempt to obtain simultaneous time resolved measurements of                    temperature, soot absorption coefficient, and Carbon Dioxide                    concentration at various positions in an acetylene/air                          diffusion flame.  The analytical approach is novel in that it                                                                                                   will attempt to follow the history of a parcel of fuel through                                                                                                  its trajectory within the turbulent flame.  Both studies will                                                                                                   be closely connected for correlation.                                                                                                                           The study proposed is a very important problem in a variety of                                                                                                  power generation, environmental, and industrial applications,                                                                                                   and the fundamental knowledge as proposed is very much in                       need.",
