This two year project               is reporting to the Center's Industry Advisory Board.                                The project is studying the thermal desorption with                        afterburner destruction in the incineration of soils to develop a               working model for soil decontamination.  The model is expected to               predict the conditions for applicability of thermal treatment to                site clean up for the National Site Remediation Program.                             The Principal Investigators are competent and have the                     facilities to perform the research.                                                  The Program Manager recommends Howard University be awarded                $99,976 for two (2) years.",
