 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply the theory of nonlinear dynamical                      systems and chaos to generate models of psychological processes.                The new mathematical and graphical methods of chaos will address                features of dynamic aspects of new and existing data streams that               have not previously been treated using formal techniques.  The                  results will make the temporal structure of cognitive and                       behavioral patterns accessible to psychologists in a language                   common to physical, biological, and social sciences.                                                                                                            Two examples of this approach are as follows:  (1) The attractors               of coordinated hand and mouth movements by newborn babies change                in an interesting way after babies are given a taste of sucrose.                This result is plain from inspection of the dynamic graph (phase-               space trajectory), and could not be obtained by standard methods,               except by piecewise spectrum analyses of coordinated time series,               requiring substantial interpretation.  The research will further                apply nonlinear theory to the full data stream for movement in                  babies.  (2) Dynamic maps show that, when people attempt to make                a series of consecutive short-term forecasts for an unfamiliar,                 chaotic, but not completely random process, the anchoring                       strategy produces an accurate behavioral analogue of the process                but inaccurate forecasts (one-step out of phase).  People who                   have had more exposure to the process make very accurate short-                 term forecasts.  The research will gather new forecasting data                  and use dynamical maps to show graphically and mathematically how               the behavioral analogue of the chaotic process moves from out-of-               phase to in-phase.   The dynamic maps of strategies may well                    become a standard method for tracing the formation of concepts                  and expectations.                                                                                                                                               In the future, this research may be useful in an educational                    context, contributing to understanding of cognitive processes                   that are sometimes problematic and are defined in terms of                      dynamic properties, such as distractibility and attentiveness; it               may also contribute new techniques for assessment and instruction               of individuals, based on the principles of optimization of                      dynamic processes.",
