 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses a new concept of forming abrasive-                      waterjets that may prove to be another breakthrough in machining                technology.  Premixed slurries will be directly pumped up to                    55,000 psi to form jets with a power density an order of                        magnitude higher than current abrasive-waterjet systems.  The                   potential advantages of direct-pumping nozzles include:  1) high                energy transfer efficiency, (2) capability of forming abrasive-                 dense jets, and (3) capability of forming jets with diameters as                small as 0.003 inch  (versus 0.030 inch for current abrasive-                   water jets).  An experimental setup will be prepared, and an                    experimental investigation will be conducted to recognize some                  features of the flow characteristics of high-pressure slurry jets               and their machining capabilities.  In addition, a technical and                 economical analysis will be conducted.  The overall feasibility                 of high-pressure pumping of abrasive slurry will be assessed and                areas of future investigation will be determined.",
