 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated field and laboratory investigation is planned of                  garnet peridotites and eclogites in the Czech portion of the                    Bohemian Massif, which is the easternmost extent of the Variscan                Orogen in Europe.  These high-pressure rocks occur in sequence of               continental crustal rocks in the Moldanubian Zone, which is the                 most internal and highly metamorphosed tectonostratigraphic unit                of the Variscan Orogen.  Previous studies have demonstrated:  1)                the occurrence of two types of garnet peridotites, which exhibit                different modes of origin, T-p histories, and cooling rates, and                2) a mantle origin for Group A eclogite lenses in peridotites,                  which formed by high-pressure crystal accumulation and were                     carried into the crust by enclosing peridotites that were                       tectonically emplaced during the Variscan Orogeny.                              Further isotopic investigations will be performed on selected                   peridotite and ecologite samples that have already been                         characterized petrologically, and integrated field, petrologic,                 geochemical, and isotopic studies will be made of additional                    peridotite bodies and Group B eclogite lenses in gneisses.  The                 results should provide a basis for establishing the timing and                  nature of high-pressure metamorphism in this portion of the                     Variscan belt, an improve our understanding of the complexities                 involved in the interaction of mantle and crust during                          orogenesis.",
