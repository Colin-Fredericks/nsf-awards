 "awd_abstract_narration": "The heterochromatin of Drosophila, as of other eukaryotes, accounts             for a substantial fraction of the genome, but its organization and              function is little understood.  Rex (Ribosomal exchange) is one of              very few heterochromatic loci that have been identified, and its                analysis will provide a significant increase in our understanding               of heterochromatin.  This locus is a maternal-effect dominant                   located in the basal heterochromatin of the X chromosome that                   promotes recombination of the ribosomal RNA genes during early                  mitotic divisions in offspring of Rex females.  Molecular and                   genetic analysis of Rex and of Rex-generated recombinants will                  focus on dissecting Rex, and on understanding the mechanism by                  which it induces rDNA exchange.                                                                                                                                 This project will increase our understanding of the heterochromatic             regions of chromosomes.  Heterochromatin has been difficult to                  analyze in the past.  This project uses unique methods not found                elsewhere.  An understanding of heterochromatin in fruit flies will             be readily transferable in principle to the large fraction of                   heterochromatin found in all mammals including man.",
