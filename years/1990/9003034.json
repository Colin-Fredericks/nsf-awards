 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is aimed at developing new conceptual and                          mathematical methods for the general analysis of mechanical                     efficiency and performance limitations of reciprocating                         kinematic heat engines.  The project is motivated by two                        recent discoveries which, taken together, indicate that                         realistically complex engine mechanisms can be treated in                       mathematically closed form fashion.  The discoveries arose                      from prior work on establishing mathematically explicit and                     general limits on the mechanical efficiency of kinematic                        engines which are analogous to the well known Carnot limits on                  thermal efficiency.  The prior work was restricted to highly                    idealized engine mechanisms models.  The present project makes                  use of a new abstract approach to model engine mechanisms                       which allow significant relaxation or essentially complete                      removal of the idealizations and restrictions of the earlier                    work.  The results of the proposed new work will be more                        faithfully representative of actual practice while retaining a                  broad general range of applicability.  This will not only                       provide more detailed insight into the specific practical                       problems involved in extracting useful work from heat engines,                  but it will also furnish a new ability to address global                        problems important to practical heat engine design and                          development such as the optimal matching of thermodynamic                       cycles and engine mechanisms.",
