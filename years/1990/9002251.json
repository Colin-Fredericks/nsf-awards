 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebras and monads, domains and categories provide powerful                    approaches to various connected problems in computation and semantics.                                                                                          The project employs categories in formalizing the iterative process in          fixed point constructions suitable for wide computational                       interpretation.  Questions such as producing a systematic approach to           interpreting non-termination and measuring the extent recursion                 coexists in the presence of powerful closure properties, necessary for          semantic interpretation, will be answered.                                                                                                                      Recent progress in interpreting domains in non-standard models of               computation will continue.  The objective here is the enumeration               of a powerful computation paradigm capable of broad semantic                    utilization in which notions such as order, continuity and                      effectiveness are intrinsically defined.  An important goal is                  providing a logical framework that will systematize present work,               promote greater accessibility, and point to possible future                     implementation.                                                                                                                                                 The research will utilize algebras and monads to study partial data             types and their computations.  Utilizing recent success with Kleisli            and Eilenberg-Moore algebras, a systematic study of various monadic             refinements and their corresponding computation calculi will be                 undertaken.  Connections with other models of partial computation and           with work in operational semantics will also be explored.",
