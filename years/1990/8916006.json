 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will strengthen our understanding of how                  the members of a honey-bee colony work together to efficiently                  gather their food.  The flowers that provide the nectar and                     pollen generally occur in patches, and the different flower                     patches vary in their profitability to the bees depending on such               factors as distance from the hive, abundance of nectar or pollen,               sugar concentration of the nectar, and so forth.  If the colony                 is to gather its food efficiently, it must solve the problem of                 allocating its foragers among the different flower patches in                   accordance with their different degrees of profitability.                                                                                                       Dr. Seeley's prior work has shown that the colony's decision-                   making is highly decentralized.  Indeed, it seems that it is                    distributed among all of the foragers in the colony rather than                 in some supervisory subset of the colony.  The present                          investigations will elucidate several still-unknown aspects of                  this group decision-making process, such as exactly how the                     recruitment to different food sources is regulated in relation to               the profitability of each food source.  This research will also                 examine more deeply how a colony adjusts its choosiness among                   nectar sources in relation to its nutritional status.  Dr. Seeley               will investigate how a colony keeps the ratio of forager bees and               food-storer bees in balance so that the difficulty of finding a                 food-storer bee serves as a reliable indicator of the colony's                  nutritional status.                                                                                                                                             The general significance of this research has several dimensions.               First, for basic biology, it provides a unique view of the high                 level of functional organization that has evolved in animal                     societies, and it reveals some of the elegant devices produced by               natural selection that enable these societies to function as                    coherent units.  Second, it shows how natural selection has built               animal groups capable of performing distributed information-                    processing to solve problems.  Hence it is demonstrating that                   animal societies, not just the nervous systems of organisms,                    offer lessons in how to build intelligence.  And third, it has                  practical implications in that it greatly strengthens our                       understanding of how honey-bee colonies in agricultural settings                choose to accept or reject a given crop as a food source and                    hence function well or poorly in pollination.",
