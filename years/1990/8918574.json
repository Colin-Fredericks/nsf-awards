 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extratropical planetary Rossby waves are known to                          propagate energy upward and equatorward from their tropospheric                 source region.  Much of this wave activity reaches the                          equatorial middle atmosphere, where relatively little is known                  about its fate.  Satellite data reveal that, around the                         solstices, when the equatorial middle atmosphere is inertially                  unstable, vertically layered disturbances (so-called \"pancake                   structures\") appear over the equator, but only when a burst of                  Rossby wave activity is impinging on the region.  In this                       fundamental hydrodynamic study, the PI will use a high vertical                 resolution middle atmosphere version of the National Center for                 Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) to                    test the hypothesis that the pancake structures are caused by                   Rossby waves entering an inertially unstable region.  A                         hierarchy of experiments will be performed in which high                        latitude wave forcing is controlled and the mean flow is                        specified successively to be inertially stable, inertially                      unstable, and finally allowed to evolve with the wave field.                    In addition to gaining insight into the fate of Rossby waves at                 low latitudes, this study will improve understanding of                         interhemispheric tracer transport.  Cross-equatorial transport                  diagnosed in the CCM will be parameterized in a two-dimensional                 middle atmosphere                                                               assessment model currently used to model ozone distribution.",
