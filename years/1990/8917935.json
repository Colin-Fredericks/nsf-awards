 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spiders of the Family Uloboridae include the most primitive                orb-weaving groups, as well as species that spin reduced                        triangular aerial webs and irregular webs.  The silk that                       constitute these prey-capture webs are composites of threads                    produced by an oval plate of spigots (the cribellum) on the                     spider's abdomen.  Variations in the morphology of the cribellum                produces changes in the strength and stickiness of the silk.  Dr.               Brent Opell proposes to study the associations between various                  kinds of cribellar morphology, silk characteristics, web                        architecture, and predatory behavior in eight species of uloborid               spiders.  These species represent both reduced- and normal-web                  spinners from different evolutionary branches of the family.  The               proposed research will establish the degree to which form                       constrains function and behavior in a complex mechanical system.                Further, the study may uncover underlying generalities concerning               the historical development of the form-function associations (for               instance, can a single cribellar change give rise to only certain               web and behavior types, or can a single web type accommodate                    changes in behavior but not silk?).                                                  The proposed research addresses questions that are                         fundamental to all of evolutionary biology.  This study will give               new insight into the relative importance of current adaptive                    needs and historical constraint in the evolution of new features.               The results of this study will be of interest to a wide range of                functional, systematic, and evolutionary biologists.",
