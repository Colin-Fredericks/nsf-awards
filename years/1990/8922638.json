 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Boehls Butte anorthosite is exposed within the broad                   border zone of the northern Idaho batholith and has experienced                 multiple episodes of fluid-rock interaction, including magmatic,                regional metamorphic and meteoric-hydrothermal events.  This                    study will examine the stable isotopic and geochemical effects of               superimposed fluid-rock interaction on the anorthosite and                      metasediments at its contact.  The objectives of this study are                 (1) to differentiate the isotopic and geochemical effects of                    post-metamorphic and synmetamorphic fluid-rock interaction, (2)                 to constrain the relative contributions of igneous, metamorphic                 and hydrothermal processes to the development of unique                         mineralogies and isotopic compositions in the anorthosite and (3)               to determine the extent to which regional metamorphism was                      accompanied by, or merely overprinted by, hydrothermal fluid                    convection associatated with batholith intrusion.  Fluid-rock                   interaction will be characterized by a combine study of stable                  isotopes, fluid inclusions, mineral-fluid equilibria and trace                  element geochemistry.  The results will constrain the depth,                    magnitude and timing of convective fluid flow through metamorphic               rocks in the border zone of the batholith, constraining the                     efficacy of deep-seated fluid convection as a dynamic process in                regional metamorphism.",
