 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant anthropological problem in adaptational                      studies is how humans adapt to high altitudes.  It has been                     demonstrated that not all human groups possess the same                         phenotypic responses to hypoxia.  Because of the variation in                   conditions of previous studies, it has been difficult to                        determine whether phenotypic differences among high altitude                    populations in the Andes, the Himalayas and elsewhere are related               to genetic differences, to differences in genotype-environmental                interactions during development, to differences in nutrition and                or disease, or to differences in barometric pressure that may                   exist between mountainous regions above and below the equator.                       This pilot study will explore in a systematic way the causes               of population differences in phenotypic response to hypoxia among               genetically similar and genetically diverse populations living                  above 3500 meters in one geographical area--Quinghai Province,                  China--thereby avoiding variations in study conditions that have                hampered previous comparisons.  The study will be carried out in                collaboration with researchers from Beijing Medical University                  and the Xining First Hospital.",
