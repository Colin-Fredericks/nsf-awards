 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tetraodontiform fishes comprise a varied group of functional               types, such as puffer fishes, boxfishes, giant oceanic sunfish.                 Graduate student Elizabeth Brainerd proposes functional and                     biomechanical performance tests on a variety of these fishes in                 the field and in laboratory settings.  Data will be gathered                    using high-speed video recordings and electromyography                          (recordings of muscle activation patterns), and will provide a                  clearer picture of their respective efficiencies in defense,                    locomotion, and food gathering.  The data acquired for different                fish species will be compared relative to their evolutionary                    relationships in order to assess whether functional efficiency                  has increased during evolution or remained static or decreased.                      The proposed dissertation research is an ambitious and                     innovative study that will produce data of wide interest to                     ichthyologists.  The conceptual implications of the study are                   broad, and the results will be of interest to functional                        morphologists and evolutionary biologists in general.",
