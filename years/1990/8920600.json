 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the electrophoretic mobility of complex colloidal                    systems is proposed.  Two model systems will be considered:                     The first consists of single, nonspherical particles having a                   nonuniform charge density that leads to a distribution of zeta                                                                                                  potential (for example, clay particles); and secondly,                          aggregates of differently charged spherical particles, (a                       dumbbell of two particles and chains of three or more                           particles).  Experiments will be performed in a specially                       designed electrophoresis chamber mounted under a fluorescence                   microscope.                                                                                                                                                     While a theory exists for nonuniformly charged spheroids, it                    does not account for polarization of the double layer, which                    occurs at high zeta potentials.  It is, thus, proposed to                       extend the theory to account for polarization effects.  There                   is presently no model for the motion of linear chains of                        alternately charged particles.  Part of this research will                      therefore, involve development of such a model for the case                     where the Debye screening length of the solution is very small                                                                                                  relative to the diameter of the particles comprising the                        chain.",
