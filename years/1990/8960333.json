 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high temperature superconductor, BiCaSrCu-oxide, and the                    ferroelectric Bi4Ti3O12 have orthorhombic lattice constants that                match almost exactly.  Single crystals of the Bi-ferroelectric                  are available in the form of large thin plates where the long                   axis of the unit cell is perpendicular to the plate, and                        thin/thick films of the Bi-superconductor can be grown by liquid                phase epitaxy.  This research deals with an integrated                          ferroelectric + superconductor structure wherein a film of the                  Bi-superconductor is grown on a crystal plate of the Bi-                        ferroelectric.  The utility of this approach is that the                        piezoelectric stress induced in the ferroelectric plate by an                   applied voltage is used to alter the properties of the                          superconducting film in the a-b plane for device applications.                  Measurements of these stress effects on the superconducting                     transition temperature and critical current density are proposed                and anisotropic couplings using actual integrated structures.                   Magnetic-field effects will also be studied (i.e., magnetic                     field parallel and perpendicular to the current direction in the                film).  Lastly, device applications suggested by the measurements               will be evaluated.",
