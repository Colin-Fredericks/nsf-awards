 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed research is to understand the nature                    of gravitationally-driven convection within mushy regions                       during the solidification of binary melts.  Better                              understanding of the interactions between convection and                        solidification will allow improvements to be made in the                        manufacture of many materials.                                                  Mushy zones are regions of mixed phase, comprising a rigid                      matrix of dendritic crystals with fluid filling the                             interstices, that form during the casting of alloys.                            Buoyancy-driven convection of the interstitial fluid can occur                  due to compositional variations that arise when one component                   of the alloy is preferentially incorporated within the solid.                   The convection can cause \"chimneys\" to form in the mushy                        region that interrupt the uniformity of the microstructure and                  create local regions of high impurity (\"freckles\").  By                         transporting solute, the convection also causes                                 macrosegregation of the casting; an initially homogeneous melt                  can solidify to form an ingot with large-scale variations of                    bulk composition.                                                                                                                                               This project is a combined theoretical and experimental                         investigation of the onset of such convection and the                           structure of the fully-developed, convective state.  The                        convective exchange of solute between a mushy layer and the                     liquid melt will be determined, so that calculations of                         macrosegregation can be made.  Additionally, the means by                       which the number density of chimneys is determined internally                   by the system will be studied; this should suggest a means by                   which freckle-free ingots can be cast.",
