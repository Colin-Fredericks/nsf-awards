 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Richard L. Francis and Sencer Yeralan of         the University of Florida for collaborative research in industrial              engineering with Professor Horst W. Hamacher of the Department of               Mathematics, University of Kaiserslautern, Federal Republic of Germany.         The objective of their collaboration is to develop algorithms and               software to help implement the automation of robotic assembly workplace         planning.  Professors Francis and Yeralan will be involved with the             engineering aspects of the project, including some computer modeling            and PC graphics, contacts with industry, expertise on robots and some           theoretical analysis.  Professor Hamacher will be involved with                 combinatorial mathematical modeling of the robotic operations and               related computer implementation of algorithms.                                                                                                                  In electronic manufacturing, many kinds of printed circuit boards have          parts to be inserted by a robot, and the insertions can be made in any          sequence.  Likewise, one is free to choose locations of bins or feeders         to contain the parts.  The choice of assembly sequence and the location         of the bins can greatly affect the total assembly time and thus the             manufacturing productivity.  Using ideas in combinatorics and location          theory, these investigators will develop algorithms to determine a best         assembly sequence and best bin locations.  The algorithms will be               implemented with software operable on a PC.  The collaborators will             also examine related problems where set-up times are dominant, and              problems involving the distribution of parts to bins.  The results are          expected to be applicable in a variety of manufacturing contexts                involving robots.",
