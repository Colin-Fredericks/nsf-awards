 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this laboratory is to understand the immune                 and host defense capabilities of the shark in an effort to                      clarify the evolutionary origin of the complex immune system                    apparent in higher vertebrates.  Thus far, three shark leukocyte                mediated cytotoxic reactions have been identified: mitogen-                     induced, spontaneous macrophage-mediated, and antibody-dependent                cellular cytotoxicity.  The first goal of the proposed research                 is to characterize shark cell surface molecules, particularly                   those which participate in spontaneous cytotoxicity, using                      antibodies reactive with shark cell membrane molecules.  Ten                    anti-shark leukocyte monoclonal antibodies have been generated,                 and others will be produced in the course of these studies.  In                 addition, three anti-human and one anti-Xenopus monoclonal                      antibody crossreact with shark cells.  These studies will define                the cell membrane molecules necessary for cytotoxic reactivity.                 A second goal is to isolate the effector cell which mediates                    antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by density gradient               sedimentation and rosetting, using shark antibody coated                        erythrocytes.  The relative efficiency of the three types of                    shark antibody to participate in this reaction will be                          determined.  Results from this study will define one of the most                primitive systems in which antibody directs the specificity of                  cellular reactivity.  A third goal is to determine whether                      sharks are capable of generating cytotoxic T lymphocytes                        following both in vivo and in vitro immunization with modified                  self or allogeneic leukocytes.  These studies will determine                    whether animals as primitive as sharks use lymphocytes                          characterized by specificity and MHC restricted interactions in                 host defense functions.                                                                                                                                         Nurse sharks evolved more than 70 million years ago, and have                   been successful as a species.  Their host defense capabilities                  permit prolonged life spans, and in captivity, they are                         relatively free from infectious disease.  Yet their immune                      capabilities are severely circumscribed in comparison to that of                more recently evolved vertebrates.  The results of this research                should make major contributions to our basic knowledge of the                   immune mechanisms of the shark.  A better understanding of                      immune-like mechanisms in a wide range organisms is important as                a basis for rational approaches to maintaining the diversity of                 organisms on earth.",
