 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project encompasses the investigation of the molecular basis                of sequence specific recognition by DNA binding proteins and, in                particular, the mechanism by which type II endonucleases achieve                their high degree of binding and catalytic specificity.  SmaI,                  XmaI and XcyI each recognize the hexanucleotide CCCGGG.  SmaI                   cleaves between the internal CpG, while XmaI and XcyI are perfect               isoschizomers and cleave between the external cytosines.                        Cytosine methylation within the recognition site inhibits the                   activity of the enzymes.  It is the aim of this proposal to                     focus on the DNA binding properties of the endonucleases and to                 compare the mechanism by which each of the proteins interacts                   with the same DNA sequence.  The project involves structural                    characterization of the endonucleases and analysis of the                       protein-DNA interaction in terms of the overall topology of the                 protein-DNA complexes, specific base and phosphate contacts and                 the potential for protein-induced bending and unwinding of the                  DNA.  The effect of cytosine methylation on the binding                         properties of the endonucleases will also be investigated.  The                 comparative study of the endonucleases will reveal whether there                are any similarities in their mechanism of molecular recognition                or whether each is characterized by a distinct mode of                          interaction with DNA.  Furthermore, the enzymes also provide a                  good model system for analyzing the potential roles of cytosine                 methylation in protein-DNA interactions.",
