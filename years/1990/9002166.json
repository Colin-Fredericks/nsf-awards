 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support for Phase II of a project                           initiated under NSF Grant No. 88-60957 under conditions                         outlined in the Program Solicitation for Small Business                         Innovation Research, NSF 88-8.  The work under Phase I                          resulted in demonstration of the feasibility of using                           electrochemically generated superoxide for rapid and                            complete degradation of chlorinated organic pollutants of                       water using specially designed electrodes that allowed for                      the efficient dechlorination of the pollutant substrates.                       In Phase II, the investigators plan a systematic                                examination of the reaction products and their rate of                          formation and destruction  as the basis for determining                         the efficiency of the process and its economic                                  feasibility.                                                                                                                                                    The contamination of ground and surface waters by organic                       compounds that are the target of this research is a matter                      of great National concern.  It is imperative that                               technologies be developed that are more efficiently                             responsive to removal of organic pollutants from water and                      wastewater.  Results of this project are expected to be                         useful in this respect.",
