The emphasis is on science               topics that relate to current societal issues, such as global                   warming, acid rain, AIDS, recombinant DNA technology, and the                   effects of drugs on the brain.                                                                                                                                  A one-day program will be held each year to introduce                           participating scientists to hands-on activities that relate to                  societal issues of relevance.  A Science and Societal Issues                    Symposium will motivate 500 high school students each year to                   confront the ethical and societal issues raised by recent                       scientific and technological advances.  Fall meetings will model                activities and pair teachers and scientists.  Each scientist will               spend at least four days per year visiting classrooms.  Spring                  follow-up meetings will enable teachers, scientists, and staff to               assess the progress of the project and generate new ideas.",
