 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has the objective to develop and implement                   substantially advanced systems for underground excavation through               the establishment of (1) systems that advance continuously and                  safely through widely varying conditions, (2) systems that have                 substantially increased rates of advance, (3) an increased range                of applications for mechanized cutting systems, and (4) increased               safety of excavation operations.  The research planned on                       continuous, automated excavation processes offers the greatest                  promise for substantial advances; however, other effort on the                  application of available and promising techniques that engage the               entire excavation system will also be performed.  The results of                this research could transform today's individual struggles to                   cope with the hostile underground environment to routine,                       continuous, automated manufacturing processes.  Broadly viewed,                 this integrated research effort has the goal to extend the                      benefits of automated manufacturing technologies into the new,                  unstructured area of tunneling.",
