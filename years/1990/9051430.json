 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at New                   Mexico State university to help purchase equipment to be used in                a new, independent, year-long physiology laboratory course.  It                 will replace existing laboratories in animal and cell physiology,               will initiate laboratory teaching of microbial and plant                        physiology, and will supplement existing lecture courses in animal,             plant, microbial, and cellular physiology, and in endocrinology and             neurophysiology.  The course will, however, be neither subsidiary               to nor dependent on lecture courses.  Instead, students will hold               a 75-minute Tutorial and Planning workshop where they will:  (1)                present briefings on principles, using abbreviated written                      material; (2) confront live material or published information that              poses a problem; (3) formulate testable hypothesis that use                     representative methods and instruments on hand; (4) review previous             results in preparation for formal report writing.  Later that week              students will convene in an open-ended laboratory where teams will              learn necessary techniques and test their own hypothesis.  Students             will not \"cookbook\" nor know expected results.  The unity of                    experimental approaches across disciplines and the similarity of                problems faced by organisms across levels of organization and                   phylogenetic disciplines will be stressed.  Digital data                        acquisition and logging will be used throughout.  The grantee is                matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
