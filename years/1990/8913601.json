Jackson and M.                                 Kent Jennings of the University of Michigan and                                 researchers from the Political Science Department                               of Beijing University.  The three objectives of the                             project are (1) to study the political and economic                             reforms taking place at the local level in China,                               (2) to examine the structure and behavior of local                              government in China, \u001acomparing these structures and                            behaviors with those in other countries, and (3) to                             bring researchers from Beijing University into the                              international research community through their                                  participation in the design of the study, the data                              collection, and the writing and publishing of                                   papers based on this work.  This project is                                     expected to provide important new findings about                                political and economic reform in China, about how                               global trends affecting all countries are being                                 dealt with in China, and about how local government                             and politics in China compare to those in other                                 countries.  It will provide some baseline analyses                              and a data set that will encompass a broad range of                             political and economic phenomena, and as such, will                             constitute a fundamental advance in the knowledge                               of and ability to study political dynamics in China.                                                                                                            This collaborative project is jointly sponsored by                              the NSF and the Chinese State Education Commission.",
