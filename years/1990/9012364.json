 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central focus in science, technology and society studies is the               identification of mechanisms by which scientific knowledge evolves.             The dissertation research of Rosa Haritos examines the concept of               discovery in science and the process by which the scientific                    community, along with others, formulates, debates and resolves                  conflict about discovery.  Discovery is a dynamic process comprised             of both empirical and social components.  Using the priority                    dispute over the discovery of the AIDS virus as a case study, this              project seeks to explain the dispute in terms of the value                      structure of the scientific community.  The study will investigate              four central problems: (1) the genesis and development of the                   dispute as it evolved over time; (2) how the discovery was defined              by the scientists involved in the discovery; (3) the values and                 norms espoused by scientists and how their beliefs influenced their             behavior in the dispute; (4) the inter-connection between science               and its social context--identification of the consequences of the               dispute.  Three sources of data will be used: (1) focused                       interviews with the scientists involved in the discovery; (2)                   focused interviews with the 13 member Retroviral Subcommittee,                  responsible for the nomenclature and classification of the virus;               (3) a detailed content analysis of what was said about the                      discovery when it was cited in the scientific literature.                                                                                                       This project will provide important primary and secondary source                material about a major contemporary public controversy involving                international science, and should contribute to understanding how               priority disputes about scientific discovery arise and are                      resolved.  The research is being supervised by an eminent                       sociologist of science; the graduate student is very well prepared              to undertake it; institutional support is adequate; and the                     expected result--a dissertation--will be forthcoming.  The                      requested support is very modest and will allow the required                    interviews to occur.  The award is highly recommended.",
