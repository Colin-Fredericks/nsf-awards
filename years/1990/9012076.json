 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation is a continuation of research into the                       mechanisms used by hydrothermal vent animals to nurture                         themselves and to avoid the toxic potentials of the vent                        habitats. The on-site studies will be executed on cruises to                    13'N on the East Pacific Rise during 1991 and 1992 in                           cooperation with a French group from IFREMER. The studies will                  focus on measuring the rates of exchange of CO2, O2, sulfide                    and potential nitrogen sources by the intact chemoautotrophic                   symbiotic associations (vestimentiferan tubeworms and mussels)                  under different conditions of temperature, pH, O2, sulfide and                  CO2, to define the environmental requirements and limitations                   on these organisms as well as to investigate the interaction of                 animal and symbiont metabolism in dealing with sulfide and its                  oxidation products. The transport of CO2, O2 and reduced sulfur                 compounds within the animals will be examined by means of                       experiments with intact animals and with isolated O2 and                        sulfide binding proteins. Similar studies will also be carried                  out on the hydrothermal vent crabs to gain an understanding of                  their abilities to live continuously in low O2, high sulfide                    environments. Similar studies will additionally be conducted                    for comparison on non-vent symbiotic and heterotrophic species                  as well.",
