 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves two workshops which will train                            approximately fifty teachers to become science mentor                           specialists in using hands-on materials and understanding                       science concepts of physical science taught in the elementary                   schools.  The teachers will be selected in teams of two, one                    K-3 and one 4-6 grade teacher coming from each school                           participating in the project. The workshops will provide the                    mentors with lesson plans and well-organized kits of                            materials for each hands-on unit; as well as training in use                    of materials and how to support other teachers' use of the                      activities.  The mentors will select the appropriate physical                   science units for the grade levels of their school and then                     provide inservice for the other teachers in their building,                     thus developing a total school program of hands-on physical                     science.  The participant schools will provide stipends to                      their teachers, release time for inservice sessions, and pay                    for the science materials which will be ordered and organized                   by the workshop.  Project evaluation, problem sharing, and                      long range program planning will be accomplished at two                         support sessions for                                                            all mentor teachers scheduled during the school year.  The cost                 sharing will be 34% of the NSF portion.",
