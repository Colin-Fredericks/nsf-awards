 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator is engaged in research in various areas of                set theory.  One of his main ongoing research interests concerns                the theory of the model L(R) with the axiom of determinacy.  The                sets of reals in L(R) form a far-reaching extension of the                      projective sets, and the goal of obtaining a more or less                       complete theory of this model with the axiom of determinacy                     (which is a natural strong set theoretic axiom for this model) is               one of his central interests.                                                        Secondly, he is working on problems connected with the                     theory of equivalence relations in ZFC.  Recently, R. Dougherty,                A.S. Kechris (who introduced the term \"descriptive dynamics\" for                this area) and the investigator obtained some results which                     suggest the beginnings of a possible classification for the Borel               equivalence relations with countable classes.  There are many                   open problems here, such as identifying a canonical cofinal                     hierarchy of equivalence relations.                                                  Thirdly, some problems of descriptive set theory of a more                 classical nature have arisen recently.  D. Mauldin and the                      investigator have recently obtained a non-uniformization type                   result for co-analytic sets.  There are open problems here, such                as how far these results can be extended in ZF, as well as other                problems in descriptive set theory which he will work on.                            Finally, he would like to devote some time to problems which               have arisen from the inner model theory for large cardinals, such               as questions about iteration trees.                                                  There is nothing more basic in mathematics than set theory.                It is arguable that the natural numbers (0,1,2,3,...) are no more               fundamental.  For this reason it is perhaps surprising to find                  questions about these fundamental objects under active                          investigation and to see that even the choice of axioms for a                   theory of sets is controversial.",
