 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies how the strategic behavior of economic agents              shapes equilibrium outcomes within small markets.  It has three                 parts.  (1)  The first is bilateral bargaining when the bargainers              have the option to break off the bargaining and seek another                    bargaining partner.  The project seeks to show that the presence                of this outside option changes equilibrium bilateral bargaining                 behavior from being essentially indeterminate to being essentially              determined.  The efficiency of decentralized markets with bilateral             bargaining is also compared to centralized markets with                         multilateral bargaining.  (2)  The second part is the study of the              behavior of duopolists whose costs are declining through learning-              by-doing.  Each period each firm decides how aggressively it should             produce so as to reduce its costs further.  The goal is to                      characterize the variety of subgame perfect equilibria that can                 exist when learning is important.  (3)  The third part involves the             use of heuristics by economic agents within dynamic games.  A                   heuristic approximates the value function that the agent would use              if he or she were perfectly rational.  The goal is to understand                how the presence of such boundedly rational agents changes the set              of equilibria.                                                                                                                                                  This research is important because it addresses one of the basic                limitations in bargaining theory, i.e., bilateral bargaining theory             with incomplete information has been unable to narrow in an                     interesting way the wide range of outcomes that are compatible with             at least one reasonable equilibrium.  The contribution from the                 first part of this project comes from exploring a neglected aspect              of the bargaining problem that could provide determinate solutions.             Conventional models of bilateral, incomplete information bargaining             neglect the option bargainers have of breaking-off bargaining with              a particular partner and bargaining with a new partner from the                 outside.  The project studies bilateral, incomplete information                 bargaining with the outside option explicitly modeled.  Preliminary             work by the investigator demonstrates that introducing the outside              option in bargaining models may eliminate the indeterminacy found               in standard models.  The research should provide useful new                     analytical tools and valuable substantive insights into the many                bargaining problems in economics.",
