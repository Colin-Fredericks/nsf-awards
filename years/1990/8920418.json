 "awd_abstract_narration": "The organ of the inner ear which detects sound is the cochlea,                  and the auditory nerve carries information from the receptors to                several clusters of cells forming the cochlear nuclei in the                    brainstem.  Although most tests of auditory coding have used tone               bursts to elicit nerve responses, adaptation is common in                       receptor organs, so that the neural responses may change during                 the stimulus.  Also, natural sounds have a dynamic rather than                  constant character.  Since intensity variations are basic                       components of natural auditory stimuli, dynamic response                        properties can play an important role in the detection,                         identification, and masking of such stimuli.   This project will                involve recording activity of single neurons and of compound                    neural responses from the whole auditory nerve.  Changes in                     adaptation and in sensitivity will be studied as they are                       affected by the intensity, frequency, or modulation frequency of                the sound.  A newly discovered residual potential in the cochlea                will be investigated to determine its neural basis, along with                  exploration of the interactions in one ear produced by                          stimulation of the brain or by the opposite ear.  This                          fundamental work will have impact on auditory neuroscience, and                 the aspects of coding will be important to other sensory systems                and to information processing paradigms.",
