 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are stellar systems that are                        characterized by sudden brightness changes.  They include novae                 and nova-like variables.  All CVs are close binary stars,                       consisting of a compact object, usually a white dwarf, and a red                star.  CVs are found among the disk and the halo population of                  stars in our Galaxy.                                                                                                                                            The Principal Investigators* (PIs) propose to observe photo-                    metrically and spectroscopically 40 to 50 CVs that are candidate                members of the halo population of our Galaxy.  The chief observing              tool will be two-dimensional charge-coupled devices (CCDs), which               will allow accurate photometric studies despite the objects'                    extreme faintness.  The goal of this research is to determine the               orbital and physical properties of halo CVs and to compare them                 with data of galactic disk CVs.                                                                                                                                 The results of this observational program and of other CV systems               already in the literature should provide information on how age,                chemical composition, and parent population affect the formation                of binary stars and, in particular, CVs.  The PIs expect to be                  able to choose between conflicting theories on the properties and               formation of CVs.                                                                                                                                               *This proposal is one of three identical proposals, each with its               own budget, submitted by Principal Investigators (PIs) from three               different institutions.  The other two PIs are Steven Howell of                 the Planetary Science Institute (NSF Proposal 8914866) and Paula                Szkody of the University of Washington (8915445).",
