 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the processes that generate                       overdispersed distributions of the hematophagous ectoparasite                   Oeciacus vicarius (Cimicidae) on it's colonial host, the cliff                  swallow (Hirundo pyrrhonata).  The study will combine                           observations on the spatial and temporal pattern of parasitism                  with field and laboratory experiments on the movement of                        individual parasites.  By fumigating cliff swallow nests to                     remove parasites and reintroducing fixed numbers of marked bugs,                the study will investigate how factors such as host quality, host               nest density, and conspecific density affect the dispersal                      activity of individual bugs.  Female swallow bugs will be fed on                swallow nestlings of various ages to determine the advantage of                 feeding on hosts of different quality.  The dispersal paths of                  individual swallow bugs under natural conditions and laboratory                 arenas will be observed to see if their movements are random or                 conform to theories of directed dispersal on a signal gradient                  (kinesis).  In order to understand the importance of intercolony                dispersal of bugs, whole colonies will be fumigated and                         recolonization rates recorded.  The predictions of mathematical                 models will then be compared, based on individual movement data                 to observed parasite distributions.  The goal is to understand                  how the movement behavior of individual bugs translates into an                 emergent pattern of parasite infestation.",
