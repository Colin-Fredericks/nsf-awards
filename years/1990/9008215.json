 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely believed that many contributions to political                 campaigns view their contributions as a kind of investment,                     expecting some private benefit in return for their money. This                  benefit might be a special tax reduction, a profitable contract                 to provide some goods or services to the government, or perhaps                 an official position. The benefit need not be forthcoming or even               precisely defined at the time the contribution is made. Rather,                 the contributor may  simply expect that , sometime in the future,               the recipient will be able and willing to provide some desired                  service.                                                                             This project continues the development of a model of                       campaign funds in which the market for political \"favors\" is                    treated as an asset market. This model captures many of the                     essential features one would expect of a market for quid pro quo                contributions, and yields a number of interesting and strong                    hypotheses which are empirically testable about the pattern of                  contributions across elections. The extensions that are being                   developed for the current project include: (1) detailed                         investigation of races with incumbents, (2) explicit                            consideration of the dynamics involved in reaching an                           equilibrium, (3) allowing contributors to supply votes as well as               money in exchange for political favors, and (5) modelling small,                individual contributors, perhaps treating their contributions as                a kind of consumer good. Empirical tests involve data on                        campaigns for the U.S. Congress and the California Legislature.                     Campaign-financing issues are under continuous public policy                debate. A better understanding of the campaign-financing process                is essential for the construction of sensible public policy.",
