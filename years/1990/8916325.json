 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two fundamentally different models have been proposed for                  profound mid-Cretaceous orogenesis in northwestern Washington and               southwestern Washington and southwestern British Columbia.  In                  one, the northwest Cascade thrust system formed during the                      collision of Wrangellia with North America, and resulted in west-               directed thrusting and burial of the Cascades crystalline core.                 In the other, orogenesis was the result of transpression and the                crystalline core was part of a large dextral shear zone.  Contro-               versy also exists regarding whether paleomagnetic data from                     plutons indicate that the intruded terranes are far travelled or                if instead the plutons have been tilted up to 35o.                                   This project will examine the Mt. Stuart batholith and                     surrounding wall rocks which occupy a key position relative to                  the northwest Cascades thrust system and the Crystalline core.                  The work will involve mapping, kinematic analysis and radio-                    metric dating.  Results are aimed at determining the amount of                  tilting in the region and how pluton emplacement and regional                   deformation change with depth.  Resolution between outstanding                  models will have considerable implications for northwest                        tectonics.",
