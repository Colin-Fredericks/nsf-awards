 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tiger swallowtails use a number of plant species that vary                 in their chemical composition.  These host species differ in                    their attractiveness to egg-laying females and their suitability                for caterpillar growth.  In addition, genetically different                     individuals show dissimilar responses on identical host plants.                 Potentially, the differential ability of swallowtails to                        recognize or grow on different plant species serves to maintain                 much of the genetic variation observed in natural swallowtail                   populations.  Although selection  tends to eliminate certain                    genotypes on certain hosts, it tends to increase their frequency                on other hosts.                                                                      The proposed research is designed to assess the genetic                    basis for the physiological and behavioral patterns of host plant               usage by the tiger swallowtail.  The investigators hypothesize                  that this subspecies is comprised of a complex of differentially                adapted genotypes and populations.  Experiments will compare the                responses of three geographic populations and families within                   populations on three different host plants.  Complementary                      analyses will determine the genetic substructure of these                       populations.  Information obtained from these laboratory and                    field studies will elucidate the role of host diversity in                      maintaining genetic variability among and within populations of a               single species.  Such knowledge will help in understanding how                  insects adapt to their food sources and will prove useful in                    developing pest management programs for commercially important                  crop species.",
