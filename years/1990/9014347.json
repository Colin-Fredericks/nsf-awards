 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Neural Processing in Cognition.  The faculty                  group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators               who come from disciplinary backgrounds as diverse as mathematics,               neural science and human behavior, but who share a common interest              in the use of mathematics and other analytic tools in the study of              relation between neural science and cognition.  The research                    programs in which trainees will participate cross the boundaries                of neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, psychology, biophysics and                    mathematics.  The funds will provide stipends for graduate students             and postdoctoral fellows, will support research participation by                undergraduate students, will defray part of the cost of the                     trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend                       scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring             visiting faculty from other research and academic institutions                  for seminars and workshops.                                                                                                                                     The challenge of relating structural and functional information                 about the nervous system to behavior is, at once, one of the most               exciting and challenging problems of modern science.  In recent                 years, the development of a variety of new techniques for locating              individual neurons within the brain and other complex structures,               for detection and isolation of hormones and other neuropeptides,                and for the analysis of the activity of individual neurons has lead             to an extraordinary increase in understanding of the physical                   structure and functional organization of the brain.  Similarly, the             development of theoretical paradigms and computational tools for                analysis of behavior has significantly increased the sophistication             of behavioral analysis.  The merging of these disparate areas of                research in approaching the underlying physiological basis of                   cognition requires the training of researchers with diverse                     expertise in fields not often taught together.  The program funded              by this award will provide both the formal training and the                     research experience required for creative work at the forefront of              modern cognitive science.",
