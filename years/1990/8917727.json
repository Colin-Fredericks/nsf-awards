 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to study the                          underlying principles of carrier transport phenomena                            in semiconductor devices with ultrasmall spatial                                and/or temporal scales through the development of                               new and advanced numerical techniques.  The general                             areas of research to be investigated are:                                                                                                                             1)    The development of a three-                                                     dimensional Monte Carlo device                                                  simulator.                                                                                                                                                2)    The development of an algorithm for                                             materials and device simulation which                                           is based on the concept of occupation                                           probability flux and the transition rate                                        matrix.                                                                                                                                             The new and advanced methods are expected t be                                  more powerful, detailed and complete than                                       conventional simulators, and can provide important                              techniques and tools to study some of the                                       fundamental questions in carrier transport, such as                             anisotropy effects, non-stationary transport and                                quantum mechanical phenomena.  Once the                                         formulations are complete, each method will be                                  applied to analyze various transport problems in                                materials and device structures through which the                               advantages of each method can be fully utilized and                             demonstrated.  The knowledge developed in this work                             will be of crucial importance to the design                                     optimization and feasibility study of novel electronic                          and optoelectronic devices, whose ever-decreasing                               dimensions render conventional simulation techniques                            more problematic and of declining value.",
