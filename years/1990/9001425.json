 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental studies at the organ and single vessel level                       suggest that hemodynamic factors play a role in                                 angiogenesis; however, the proposed factors have not been                       proven to work in microvascular networks.  This proposal                        focuses on the hypothesis that the development of mature                        microvascular network from the primitive neonatal vascular                      plexus (the process of network remodeling) is the result                        of gradual adaptation of vessels to local mechanical                            forces, such as, shear stress exerted by blood flow on the                      vessel wall and intravascular pressure.  To test the                            hypothesis in cerebral tissue, experiments will be                              performed to study changes in intracortical and pial                            microvascular architecture and vascular dimensions in two                       to five week old rats, and to correlate some of these                           changes with wall shear stress, intravascular pressure and                      other hemodynamic variables.  Subsequently, a mathematical                      model will be developed to test whether the architecture                        of intracortical microvascular networks can be predicted                        from the microvascular architecture of the neonate and                          certain properties of vascular adaptation learned from the                      experiments.  These studies will provide important new                          information on the role of hemodynamic factors in the                           development of the cerebral microvascular bed which may                         influence growth and repair of cerebral tissue.",
