It is now increasingly accepted                in the Cuillin Complex consists of multiple concentric intrusions               separated by significant time gaps.  The resulting complex                      thermal history and recent isotopic studies (Farver and Giletti,                1989; Ito et al., 1986) suggest the occurrence of two (or more)                 phases of fluid flow.  Studies of large intrusions elsewhere                    (e.g., Bird et al., 1986, 1988) have documented the importance of               fluid flow through fractures leading to hydrothermal alteration                 of the plutons.  Forester and Taylor (1977) suggested an                        extensive, penetrative style of fluid flow in the Cuillin                       Complex, but the results of Ito et al. (1986) suggest that                      fractures may have been important in channeling the fluid flow                  within the complex.  The Cuillin Complex, with its exceptional                  exposure and a significant body of accumulated high quality data,               is an ideal setting in which to clarify the relationships among                 the nature of hydrothermal alteration, fluid flow, mass transfer,               and their timing in relation to the cooling history.",
