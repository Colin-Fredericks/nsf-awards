 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution will undertake a                    project to develop a sensitive radiometer for in situ                           measurements of irradiance in the water column.  Optical                        measurements at sea are becoming increasingly important to                      ocean science field investigations and adequate optical                         instrumentation is often lacking.  The low light auto-                          radiometer (LoLAR) will employ a photomultiplier tube which                     allows greater sensitivity than silicon-photodiode based                        technology permits on currently used instruments.  The new                      instrument will increase the sensitivity of light level                         detection and measurement by a factor of five.  At-sea use of                   photomultiplier tube instrumentation requires development of                    several special design features, including autocalibration,                     temperature dependency corrections, light collection, and                       data acquisition.  In situ irradiance measurements have been                    primarily restricted to the near surface waters of the ocean                    because of limited instrumentation sensitivity.  Several                        types of ocean science research investigations would benefit                    from increased sensitivity by being able to make light                          measurements deeper in the water column.  The types of                          research that would benefit from this new instrument include                    hydrologic optics that relate to physical properties                            affecting light penetration in the ocean as a function of                       depth; photophysiology of populations, concerning the                           distribution of organisms and their orientation as related to                   different light fields; and bioluminescence research.  The                      general purpose instrument will be usable on submersibles,                      remotely operated vehicles, moorings, nets, and profiling                       systems.",
