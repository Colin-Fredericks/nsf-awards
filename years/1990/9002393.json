 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in electrical                    engineering and computer science between two US and French                      groups.  The US researchers are:  Drs. Allan Willsky and                        Sanjoy Mitter, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Dr.                   Bernard Levy, University of California at Davis.  The French                    researchers are:  Drs. A. Benveniste, R. Nikoukhah and M.                       Basseville, French National Institute for Computer Science                      and Automation (INRIA).                                                                                                                                         The research will focus on five topics:  1)  multi-resolution                   statistical signal and image processing, including the                          development of novel multi-scale stochastic models for                          efficient and highly parallel algorithms 2)  discrete event                     systems, including the blending of concepts from computer                       science and control in order to develop an effective                            methodology for the monitoring and control of complex systems                   3)  noncausal system models and efficient parallel algorithms                   for optimal estimation 4) distributed parameter systems,                        including a complete treatment of infinite dimensional                          systems and 5)  system and estimation-theoretic approaches to                   computer vision. The project will benefit from the history of                   previous and successful collaboration between these two                         groups and the extensive and complementary expertise of the                     US and French investigators.",
