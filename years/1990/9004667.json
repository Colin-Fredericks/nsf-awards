 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peters proposed to study how protein structure controls                     the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes associated                      with the dissociation of carbon monoxide from myoglobin.  The                   method of analysis is time-resolved photoacoustic                               calorimetry.  Time-resolved photoacoustic calorimetry                           measures the dynamics of the enthalpy and volume changes for                    reactions that are initiated by light.  The resolution of the                   experiment is such that for reactions which occur in less                       than 100 nanoseconds, the sum of the enthalpy and volume                        changes are measured.  For reactions occurring between 100                      nanoseconds and 20 microseconds the dynamics of enthalpy and                    volume changes can be obtained.  For the past three years Dr.                   Peters has been examining the dynamics of enthalpy and volume                   changes associated with the photodissociation of carbon                         monoxide from sperm-whale, horse and human myoglobins.  He                      has found evidence for a new intermediate in sperm-whale                        myoglobin that is formed upon the dissociation of carbon                        monoxide which involves the breaking of a salt bridge and re-                   organization of the protein structure.  Following these                         initial observations Dr. Peters would like to investigate the                   nature of this protein structural change.  He will examine                      mutants of sperm-whale and human myoglobin, engineered by                       site directed mutagenesis, to determine the origin of the                       barrier to the formation of this intermediate.  Also, using                     combinations of buffers he will examine pH titration curves                     for the energetics and dynamics of the myoglobins in order to                   ascertain if structural changes are occurring within the                        protein that may effect the acidity of some amino acids.",
