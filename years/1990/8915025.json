 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is a quantitative,                          computationally efficient, atom-based description of the dynamics               of rotational isomerism in macromolecules.  The formalism can be                used to determine the rate of initial passage into any specified                subset of the conformations of the chain.  The validity of the                  theoretical formalism will be assessed by two types of                          experiments.  The first type of experiment, performed in the                    laboratory with real molecules, is the measurement of the                       dynamics of the occupation of that subset of conformations that                 produces an intramolecular excimer, to be performed as functions                of the fluorescence lifetime of the chromophore, chemical                       structure and length of the flexible fragment, and conformations                of the flexible fragment that belong to the subset that produces                excimer emission.  The second experiment, performed with a                      computer, is a computationally intensive molecular dynamics                     simulation, with femptosecond time steps, the results of which                  will be compared with those obtained from the computationally                   much more efficient dynamic rotational isomeric state theory.",
