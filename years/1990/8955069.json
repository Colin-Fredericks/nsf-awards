 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Family Math program was developed to enable and encourage              parents and children to enjoy the learning and doing of mathematics             together.  The project has been highly successful over the past                 eight years in a number of communities throughout the United                    States.  The current project is designed to improve access to                   Matematica Para La Familia, the Spanish version of Family Math, for             a large number of Spanish speaking families in Florida, Arizona,                and Texas who have not yet had the opportunity to participate in                this program. In addition, the project will provide follow-up                   networking activities for participants in all sites and will extend             the evaluation of the project to focus on two communities where the             target families are made up  predominantly of migrant workers.                  Cost-sharing in the amount of $294,286 is 44% of the amount                     requested from NSF.//",
