 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a non-destructive                     instrument for measuring the thermal conductivity and                           interface thermal resistance of thin films utilized in                          electronic components.  Previous methods of making these                        measurements were difficult, time consuming, and not amenable                   to in-situ measurements of components.  This method is                          applicable when the films are deposited on high thermal                         conductivity substrates, and a set of three to four coatings,                   each with a different and known thicknesses, are applied.  The                  temperature-time history of a sample is taken when suddenly                     placed in contact with point heat source, and this history is                   compared with the results obtained from a substrate of known                    thickness and thermal conductivity, and utilizing the results                   of an analytical developed at the University of Rochester.                                                                                                      The development and commercial availability of a                                nondestructive for thermal conductivity and interface thermal                   resistance in dielectric and other thin films will permit                       rapid advances to be made in the design and construction of                     multilayer structures with improved heat flow characteristics.                  It also will be a useful diagnostic tool in semiconductor                       defect detection and quality control.",
