 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that an Optronics C-4100SP microdensitometer, and                a Silicon Graphics Iris 4D/280SX computer be purchased, for use in              structural studies of proteins and nucleic acids by Drs. Stubbs,                Anders, Flicker, Robinson, Newcomer and others.                                 Drs. Flicker and Robinson plan to utilize cryo-electron microscopy              in their structural studies of protein assemblies: Dr. Flicker is               studying actomyosin complexes; Dr. Robinson studies neurotoxins.                Dr. Stubbs' studies of plant virus structure will also benefit from             cryo-electron microscopy facilities.                                                                                                                            Drs. Anderson, Newcomer, and Stubbs are using protein                           crystallographic methods to study a variety of molecules.  With a               number of new crystals new available, the present facilities have               reached saturation.  Furthermore, several of the crystal forms have             unit cells too large to permit data collection using existing                   facilities.  Dr. Stubbs' fiber diffraction studies also require                 equipment capable of resolving diffraction data from very large                 unit cells.                                                                                                                                                     The major users make heavy use of the existing computer facilities.             Structural refinement, especially by Dr. Anderson and Stubbs and                new projects of Dr. Newcomer and Flicker, will require                          substantially increased computing capacity.",
