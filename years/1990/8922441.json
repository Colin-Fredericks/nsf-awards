 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in biophysics                    between Dr. Robert Gould, Middlebury College and Dr. W. Terence                 Coakley, University of Wales, Cardiff. The objective of the                     project is to exploit the use of ultrasound to segregate and                    isolate large particles of biological interest.                                                                                                                 When an ultrasonic standing wave field exists in a liquid-filled                chamber, suspended particles of a given type will tend to collect               at positions in the chamber about a half wavelength apart.  The                 ultrasonic phenomena of radiation pressure and acoustic streaming               associated with a standing wave field produce forces and torques                on objects in suspension.  Strengths of the forces and torques on               a given particle depend mainly on the size and shape of the                     particle and on the acoustical properties of compressibility and                density of the particle, relative to the corresponding properties               of the suspending liquid.  Thus particles differing in acoustic                 properties will tend to collect in different positions in the                   chamber.   Methods for collecting particles in suspension with                  which most biologists are familiar, such as centrifugation,                     dielectrophoresis and application of magnetic fields, tend to                   cause particles to migrate to one or two sites.  Ultrasound                     offers a unique capability to concentrate particles at many                     discrete locations in the suspending phase. This project aims to                utilize the differences in the forces and torques on different                  types of particles to diverge them, one type from another, so                   they may be harvested and studied separately. The results of this               research will provide important information regarding the                       applicability of ultrasound to a variety of biological systems.                 The project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the                two investigators, as well as their past history of fruitful                    collaboration.",
