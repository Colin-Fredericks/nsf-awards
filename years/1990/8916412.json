 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium plays important physiological roles in living organisms.  It is         a major component of biominerals.  Extracellular levels are involved in         excitation secretion coupling and intracellular levels have recently            been implicated as messengers in coordinating cellular responses.  This         proposal intends to use the molting cycle of the freshwater crayfish as         a model system in which to study mechanisms of Ca2+ regulation.                 Crustaceans are ideal for this since they alternately undergo Ca2+              uptake (skeletal deposition) and Ca2+ output (skeletal resorption).             The associated mechanisms are highly refined in freshwater (ion                 limited) species.  The study will be completed at 7 experimental levels         which are (1) whole animal Ca2+ (and associated electrolyte--Na+, Cl-,          HCO-3, H+) and water distribution among body tissues; (2) branchial             fluxes; (3) renal postfiltrational processing; (4) the electrochemical          basis of extracellular regulation; (5) skeletal and soft tissue                 regulation; (6) epithelial transport modeled on an isolated cuticular           hypodermis and (7) subcellular distribution of transport enzymes Ca2+           and Na+/K+ ATPases and carbonic anhydrase.  Each of these parameters            will be studied in crayfish undergoing natural molts in artificial tap          water (controls) at 21 C.  Completion of the project should                     significantly advance our general understanding of the mechanisms and           control of bidirectional epithelial Ca2+ transport with specific                reference to crustacean molting.",
