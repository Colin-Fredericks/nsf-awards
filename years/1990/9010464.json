 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental degradation is one of the most serious problems                   facing industrialized societies.  Remedies or prevention of harms               caused by environmental pollution require collective activities of              many people.  Sociolegal research has for many years focused on the             connections of law to disputing, dispute transformation, and social             change.  This project will draw on theories and research from this              literature to examine the expansion or contraction of rights and                the handling of conflicts about the environment.                                                                                                                Using a new class-action lawsuit in Kobe, Japan as a case study,                this project will trace the formation of a social movement and the              transformation of its conflict with industry and government over                the issue of air pollution.  Through interviews with participants               involved in the filing of 500 lawsuits by Japanese citizens in an               industrial pollution case, the investigators will trace how the                 grievances of individual citizens produced a victims' organization,             government legislation, subsequent government retreat from aid to               victims, and involvement in litigation.  Thus, the in-depth study               permits detailing the different social forces which have affected               the development of both political and legal action as well as the               relationship between the two.                                                                                                                                   This research will illustrate the complex legal, cultural, and                  political processes involved in policy formation and the relevance              of theory in this area to the explanation of responses to                       environmental change.  It promises to extend our understanding of               the connection between legal institutions, policy change, and the               actions of everyday citizens as well as provide important new                   insights into patterns of conflict management in Japan and                      elsewhere.  How rights are articulated and how law becomes                      mobilized on issues relating to the environment have immensely                  important theoretical and policy implications for understanding                 global environmental change, the development of rights movements,               and the process of legal mobilization.",
