 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in the geochemistry of                 early volcanic rock to be conducted by Charles Stern of the                     University of Colorado at Boulder and Michael Dobbs of the                      University of Santiago, Chile.  The work will involve field                     mapping and chemical analysis of Pliocene and early Quaternary                  Andean volcanic rocks near Santiago.  These rocks were formed at                the boundary between two distinct segments of the Andes across                  which important north to south differences occur in the angle of                Pacific plate subduction, in spatial and petrochemical                          characteristics of recently active Andean volcanos and in                       significant geologic and tectonic features.  The study will refine              the understanding of the temporal and spatial relationships                     between the changing features near the north-south segment                      boundary, of Andean magma genesis and of the economically                       significant copper mineralization developed during Pliocene                     volcanism.                                                                                                                                                      In addition to the scientific results, this project allows for a                significant international interchange and the training of graduate              students from both the United States and from Chile.  Also, it                  provides an opportunity for participation of the Chileans in the                advanced analytical chemistry in Colorado.  This kind of training               and participation is an important feature of the Science in                     Developing Countries program.",
