Gandour's study of \"Models to Test                 Proximity and Position in Catalysis\" in the Chemistry                           Department at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge.  This                    project will use biarylethynyl model compounds to test ideas                    concerning how the placement and orientation of a catalytic                     functional group affect the rate at which it serves to                          accelerate a reaction.                                                                                                                                          This project in intramolecular recognition will investigate the                 general base catalyzed hydrolysis of a series of esters in                      order to determine how critical to rate enhancement is the                      positioning (distance and orientation) of the catalytic group                   and the substrate in an enzymatic active site.  The models                      being studied have been selected so that comparisons are made                   between systems differing only in the number of degrees of                      rotational freedom and/or the time-average distance between                     reacting groups.  The rate enhancements engendered by proximity                 are being determined by comparing the hydrolysis rates of                       compounds with free rotation (no tether) with those containing                  tethers of varying lengths.",
