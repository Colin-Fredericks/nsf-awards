 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will allow a cultural anthropologist to study the                  school success of minority children of Iranian ancestry in the                  San Jose, California school system.  Hypotheses to be tested                    include the effects on school performance of socio-economic class               as opposed to family support and educational values, the reason                 for migrating and opportunities for returning, and involvement in               a local ethnic subculture. Methods involve participant                          observation, structured and survey interviewing, and analysis of                school records.  The PI is an experienced researcher who has done               research in Iran several times from 1969 through 1978.                                                                                                          This research is important because the causes of school success                 among minority and immigrant populations is a central problem in                U.S. Society.  Studies such as this which shed light on school                  performance can increase our understanding of how some minorities               and minority individuals can be successful in mainstream schools,               and help us understand the relationship between the development                 of ethnic subcultures and the educational experiences of                        immigrants.",
