Prakash of the Central Food Technology Research                      Institute in Mysore, India.  The research is aimed at                           understanding the interaction between proteins and various                      ligands present in oil seeds such as sunflower, sesame,                         peanut, and cotton seeds.  The presence of these ligands                        prevents the full utilization of the proteins in these                          seeds.  In this research, isolation of high and low                             molecular weight proteins as well as isolation of                               constituant ligands will be completed.  A study will be made                    of the interactions of pairs of individual proteins and                         individual ligands, to determine the results under different                    reaction conditions, and to understand the nature of the                        binding site stoichiometry, geometry and reaction kinetics.                     Various biophysical techniques will be used in the study                        including spectropolarimetry, analytical                                        ultracentrifugation, fluoresence polarisation, affinity                         chromatography, and spectrophotometry.                                                                                                                          Scope:  This research brings together a well-established                        U.S. scientist and a highly productive young researcher from                    India to work on a problem of basic scientific interest in                      the biophysics and biochemistry areas.  In addition, this                       research has potentially significant benefits in improving                      the capabilities of many Less Developed Countries to meet                       their nutritional needs.  The two scientists will complement                    each others' work to enhance the expected research output.                      This project meets the objectives of the U.S.-India                             Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    Funding:  This project is being funded under two grants as                      follows:                                                                                                                                                                      Brandeis Univ.
