 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inquiries into microclimatological patterns and processes have             been inhibited by difficulties in determining micro-scale variations in         heat and moisture transfers.  Among the most important variables are            transfers of water vapor through evaporation and transpiration from             ground surfaces and vegetation into the air.  Lysimeters have been              developed to directly measure evapotranspiration, but these machines            are large, stationary, expensive, and capable only of averaging                 readings over the area that they cover.  This collaborative research            project will refine and test a set of minilysimeters to measure spatial         variations in the transfer of heat and moisture.  Three continuously            weighing, portable minilysimeters will be designed and tested in a              carefully controlled experiment that will compare their measurements            with records obtained using three alternative microclimatological               approaches.                                                                          This project will determine the extent to which small, portable            minilysimeters can be used to accurately measure evapotranspiration in          a variety of different sites.  These tests will help ascertain the              conditions in which these instruments will be useful and the confidence         with which the data that they collect can be used.  Because of the              potential for using instruments of this type to provide heretofore              unavailable information about micro-scale spatial variability in heat           and moisture transfer, the project should contribute significantly              toward advancement of microclimatological research.",
