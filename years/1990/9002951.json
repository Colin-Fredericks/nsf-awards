 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the work supported by this award the principal investigator                  will extend some of his work on the infinite-line Kaup-Newell                   perturbation theory for a single soliton solution of a nonlinear                Schroedinger system to the multiple soliton case.  This work has                applications to the transmission of data in the form of wave                    packets through nonlinear optical fibers, and so such it is                     highly relevant to the design of modern communications' systems                 that utilize optical fiber technology.  The principal                           investigator will employ methods based upon asymptotics in order                to study the behavior of solutions of nonlinear systems of                      partial differential equations.                                                 Every day, it seems, there are articles in the newspapers about                 the use of fiber optics technologies in the design of modern                    communications systems.  Indeed, telephone companies and                        computer companies are very much interested in designing                        \"lossless\" ways of transmitting data.  One possible solution is                 the emerging technologies based upon fiber optics, since fiber                  optics  affords the potential of transmitting data without                      significant dispersion or distortion.  With this award the                      principal investigator will study solutions of the nonlinear                    system of equations that describes the propagation of waves                     through optical fibers.",
