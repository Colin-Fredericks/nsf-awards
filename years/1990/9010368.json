 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fuel spray vaporization is a crucial phase in the operation of                                                                                                  liquid fuel combustion devices.  At present there is a lack of                                                                                                  studies of evaporating sprays with quantitative measurements                    of the vapor phase distribution, a result of the limitations                    of the measurement techniques available for measuring vapor.                                                                                                    A nonintrusive, laser based, infrared extinction technique has                                                                                                  been developed based on the strong absorption of incident                       radiation at a 3.39 wavelength by hydrocarbon fuels.  The                       technique holds great promise for accurate quantitative                         measurement of the vapor phase but, due to its limited use,                     little knowledge is available on the accuracy of the technique                                                                                                  in two-phase flows.  In order to fully assess the accuracy and                                                                                                  limitations of the infrared extinction technique in                             quantifying fuel vaporization, an experiment is proposed in                     which the techniques will be used in a very controlled                          simulated spray                                                                 environment.  The simulated spray consists of solid                             polystyrene spheres injected with a pure hydrocarbon gas,                       providing great flexibility in studying the effects of spray                    characteristics on the accuracy of the vapor measurements.                                                                                                      Finally, improvements are proposed in the optical system                        geometry previously used for the infrared extinction                            technique, allowing more spatially precise measurements.                        Spatial precision is vital to the successful application of                     the infrared extinction technique to pulsed sprays and highly                   turbulent flows.",
