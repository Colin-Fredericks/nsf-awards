The development and use of mathematical                    models in integral to scientific research.  Recent                              technological developments have provided new tools for                          mathematical modeling including graphing calculators and                        microcomputers.  The focus of this project is to familiarize                    students with mathematical modeling and its role in many                        diverse areas of scientific endeavor.  By exposing students                     to a variety of scientists and mathematicians using                             mathematical modeling in their work, the project will                           stimulate interest in science disciplines as possible and                       realistic career choices and make the students aware of the                     academic preparation necessary for such careers.  This                          project, using the theme of mathematical modeling as an                         introduction to experiences in other disciplines, is designed                   to do precisely that.  Each cycle of the project, lasting                       one year, will consist of a three-week residential camp                         during July and August, follow-up activities during the                         academic year, and a culminating one-week residential camp                      during the following June.",
