 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Alan                 Newell, University of Arizona and Professor R. Ribotta, Laboratoire             de Physique des Solides, University of Paris-Sud, France.  The                  objective of the proposed work is an interdisciplinary investigation            of electrohydrodynamic instability in nematic liquid crystals.                                                                                                  Electrohydrodynamic convection (EHC) in nematic liquid crystal                  layers is now beginning to attract much attention.  Liquid                      crystals themselves are of theoretical and practical interest, but              very little is known about how they interact with electric fields               at the microscopic level.  The onset of convection can be modelled              by the Ginsburg-Landau equations, which are derived from fluid                  equations, and the case of liquid crystals makes the analysis very              tractable.  A full understanding of the phenomena involved                      requires both theoretical and experimental expertise; specific wave             solutions must be used to represent the behavior and the parameter              values, determined experimentally, must be inserted in the                      equation.  The investigators propose to use a combination of                    theory and experiment to determine the coefficients of the complex              Ginsburg-Landau equation for the order parameter which obtains in               a range of parameter values close to onset.  The knowledge of                   these coefficients will provide information on the nature of the                dispersion relation for small amplitude waves, as well as nonlinear             saturation characteristics.  The results of this project could                  lead to important advances in our understanding of convection.  Dr.             Newell is a leading applied mathematician, who has worked                       extensively on the topic of Ginsburg-Landau equations.  Professor               Ribotta will provide the necessary experimental expertise in                    advanced liquid crystal research.",
