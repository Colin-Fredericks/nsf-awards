 "awd_abstract_narration": "A scientific revolution represents more than the overthrow of one               scientific theory or system by another.  It also represents the                 displacement from positions of authority of the advocates of the                old by advocates new system or theory.  In modern times, we see                 this in the dispensation of research grants, invitations to give                talks, etc.  There is something rather pathetic about, for example,             the proverbial fruit fly geneticist whose lab is no longer funded,              who has no more graduate students, and who doesn't get travel                   grants to the international congresses.  Too often, these displaced             scientists (or rather, scientists whose theories have been                      displaced) wind up teaching the introductory courses or, perhaps                safer, the history and philosophy of science courses in their                   departments|  Needless to say, the resistance to new theories thus              carries with it a social as well as intellectual component.  Under              this grant, Dr. Biagioli is looking at this social and intellectual             process as it developed at the start of modern science.  He is                  completing his analysis of Galileo's career and strategies for the              legitimation of Copernicanism and the mathematical method.                                                                                                      Dr. Biagioli has found that disciplinary hierarchies established                under the then accepted scholastic system held mathematics to be                subordinate to philosophy and theology.  Consequently, Galileo                  needed to increase his social and disciplinary status in order to               legitimize Copernican astronomy and mathematical physics.  However,             as mathematicians could not obtain the higher status of                         philosophers within the university, Galileo looked elsewhere.  His              career traces a trajectory of socio-professional escalation away                from the university toward the court (where he became the first                 mathematician to obtain the title of \"philosopher\"), finally                    landing in the newly created scientific academy--and institutions               in which the \"new philosophers\" could dictate the rules of their                own game.  Under this grant, Dr. Biagioli is specifically studying              Galileo's activity within the first scientific institution, the                 Accademia dei Lincei, and the strategies for the legitimation of                Copernicanism he developed through the authority of that                        institution.  This work offers not only a specific case study, but              brings together a range of analyses that he has already developed.              Further, on a broader scale, this study illustrates the strategies,             both social and intellectual, which advocates of a new scientific               system must use in order to displace their adversaries and gain                 access to sources of support for their research.",
