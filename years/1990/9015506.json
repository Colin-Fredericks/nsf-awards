 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award for doctoral dissertation research in decision, risk, and            management science will suppoprt research costs for work on the                 dissertation, \"Finding Risk Capital for Entrepreneurs:  An Examination          of the Effects of Complexity-Reducing Information on Investor                   Patterns.\"  The purpose of this study is to compare how venture capital         firms and private, individual investors, manage risks associated with           providing capital to new ventures.   It addresses the question of why           these two types of venture capitalists exist simultaneously in                  ventures.  It suggests that the basis for their simultaneous existence          is likely to be that they each have comparative advantages in risk              management.                                                                                                                                                     This study draws upon previous work showing that venture capital firms          and individual investors rely upon separate networks for information            regarding how to control risk.  Mail questionnaires, face-to-face               interviews, and telephone interviews will be used to gather information         on the two prominent segments of the venture capital market.                    Covariance structure modeling will be used to examine and test the              relationships between the perception of risk type and the                       implementation of controls to manage risk.  A practical implementation          of this study is that it can be helpful in assisting entrepreneurs              locate risk capital, by helping them know how their projects' riskiness         is viewed by potential investors.",
