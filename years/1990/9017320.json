 "awd_abstract_narration": "The brain has pathways of nerve fibers that run between cell                    groups, to carry information in a code, since the signal itself                 is simply the firing pattern of individual nerve fibers.  Two                   major kinds of coding have been proposed.  One proposes that                    each fiber from a sensory organ carries a certain kind of                       information alone, so that for example a class of fibers from                   the tongue are active only when there is a sweet substance but                  not when there is a sour one; this coding is called a \"labelled                 line.\"  The other proposes that the brain takes in the varied                   pattern of activity from a whole group of fibers, where each                    one has a somewhat different response to a whole range of                       stimuli, and determines from the overall pattern that one                       taste, for example, is \"more sweet\" while another is \"more                      sour\"; this coding is called the \"across-unit pattern.\"  This                   proposal uses a novel exploratory approach of artificial                        stimulation in the taste pathway to try to mimic the sensory                    activity.  Stimulation to mimic the neural responses to sugar                   taste will be paired to licking of plain water by the animal,                   and the animal will be conditioned to avoid that experience.                    If the behavioral taste aversion is transferred to cause                        avoidance of naturally licking other sweet substances, then                     this technique will be validated as an important way to study                   what features of spatially and temporally distributed patterns                  of input are important for the brain to act on in producing                     relevant behavior.  Results will be important to virtually all                  sensory systems, and to bioengineering/computational models as                  well, because of the active interest in how labelled lines or                   parallel processing work in distributed systems.",
