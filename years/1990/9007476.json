The sessions will include:  engineering seismology                 and seismotectonics; microzonation; urban design and public                     policy; survey and evaluation of damages; gravity structures;                   buildings behavior; offshore structures; retrofitting of                        structures; soil-structures interaction; and earth and rockfilled               dams and embankments.  The meeting is expected to be well                       attended from India, the U.S., Europe and Japan.                                                                                                                Scope:  Earthquake effects are of global interest.  The U.S. and                India are among leading countries conducting vigorous research in               various earthquake engineering aspects.  The conference provides                a good forum for a fruitful exchange of research findings and                   ideas.  The University of Roorkee has departments of earthquake                 engineering, civil engineering, and geology and geophysics where                research is being done.  Cooperative research between Roorkee                   staff and U.S. scientists has continued for more than a decade.",
