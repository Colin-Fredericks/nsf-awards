Four basic areas will be emphasized; (1) coronal processes               of 3D reconnection, (2) Alfven wave absorption and turbulence,                  (3) instability and turbulence in coronal mass ejections, and                   (4) the theory of fast dynamo action and the modelling of the                   alpha-effect. These problems are important for understanding                    flares, coronal heating, the solar wind and the solar cycle.                    Earlier work concentrated on ideal and resistive MHD                            instabilities in line-tied solar coronal loops, and showed, in                  nonlinear MHD simulations, that the instabilities cause current                 sheets to form.  Also studied was Alfven wave resonant                          absorption in coronal flux tubes driven by photospheric motion.                 The current work will concentrate on current sheets, 3D                         reconnection, and possible singularities of 3D equilibria in                    solar coronal magnetic loops. Secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz                        instabilities in Alfven waves and other absorption mechanisms                   will also be studied. MHD instabilities and dynamics of coronal                 mass ejection models will be investigated, and the fast dynamo                  analyses will be expanded to encompass steady flows with chaotic                webs, and time dependent flows which are close to integrable                    flows.  The effort will include new methods for calculating                     transport by chaotic flow, and the graphical representation of                  magnetic structures produced by dynamos.  *** //",
