 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the feasibility of searching out a \"tell-               tale\" protein of fruit maturation initiation. If positive the                   method will provide a totally new tool, based on a factor known                 to be primary to maturation, with which the orchardist, the                     storage operator and even the seller could determine the onset                  of ripening. This tool could markedly reduce costs of storage                   and reduce losses. The overall goal of Phase I research will be                 to produce polyclonal antibodies to malic enzyme and post                       initiation protein No. 5. These antibodies could be used to                     develop an immunoassay during Phase II which detects or                         quantitates changes in specific proteins that occur in synchrony                with or just prior to the onset of the ripening process.                        %%%                                                                             Production of antibodies against these ripening specific proteins               for development of a maturity test kit is highly desirable and                  would circumvent the need for complex techniques involved in                    current maturity programs, including various gas chromatographic                analyses for ethylene.",
