It is being funded under the Instrumentation and                  Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                     improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by                        supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                 undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science,                       mathematics, or engineering.  In particular, the purposes of the                course which will be supported are (1) to encourage an                          experimental attitude towards mathematics in the students, by                   using the computer as a laboratory for strengthening intuitive                  insight, suggesting conjectures, and illuminating theory, (2) to                deepen the understanding of theoretical concepts and methods by                 motivating students by what they learn experimentally, and (3) to               make students appreciate the relation between mathematical                      analysis and the algorithmic/computational activities made                      possible by current advances in computer technology.",
