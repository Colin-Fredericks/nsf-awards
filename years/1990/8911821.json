 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Conti-Tronconi studies the relationship between the molecular               structure and function of the nicotinic receptor, a membrane                    protein which recognizes and binds acetylcholine.  Acetylcholine                is an ubiquitous neurotransmitter, which mediates transmission of               commands between nerve cells and between neurons and effector                   cells, such as muscle.  For this reason, Dr. Conti-Tronconi's                   research has both theoretical and practical implications.  She                  has developed a technique to define separate regions of the                     nicotinic receptor, using antibodies raised against fragments of                the receptor molecule, which are isolated by reacting the                       receptors with naturally occurring poisons.  When these                         antibodies react with native receptors they disturb the                         receptor's function.  These data are then used to construct a                   steric and functional model of the molecule.  Dr. Conti-Tronconi                intends to exploit fully the advantages of this technical                       approach by systematically altering the amino acids sequence in                 separate fragments of the nicotinic receptor already recognized;                the functional effects of these modifications will be assessed by               testing the ability of the altered segment to bind to poisons as                well as to antibodies raised against intact fragments.  Dr.                     Conti-Tronconi also intends to complement these studies by                      obtaining maps of nicotinic receptor fragments by Nuclear                       Magnetic Resonance and by X-ray diffraction.  The most ambitious                goal of the research is to define the structure of the receptor                 which determines the selectivity of this membrane protein to ion                flow.  These same techniques, once proven and refined in studying               the nicotinic receptors, can be applied in the future to the                    elucidation of other functional structure of other receptors'                   molecules.",
