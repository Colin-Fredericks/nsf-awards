 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to construct a convection tank filled with a               fluid such as corn syrup whose viscosity is very sensitive to                   temperature variations.  It is to be bounded below by a flat                    glass surface at constant temperature and bounded above by a thin               layer of relatively low viscosity immiscible fluid such as                      silicon oil or kerosine.  Above that layer is a flat glass                      surface at a constant colder temperature than below.  The breadth               of the tank is to be at least five times the depth so that many                 cells with large aspect ratio are possible.  It is desired to                   attain as high a Rayleigh number as possible within the physical                limitations of the fluids and tank.  With this one can attain up                to 20 cm depth of test fluid that will lead to a Rayleigh number                in excess of a million.  We anticipate that the above                           configuration will exhibit convection closer to that believed to                exist in the mantle, with columnar thermals of hot fluid rising                 from the bottom boundary layer and with more sheetlike cold                     thermals descending from the top.",
