 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crassulacean Acid Metabolism is an intriguing photosynthetic pathway            that interacts with a number of environmental factors including water           stress.  The general objective of this proposal is to understand the            compartmentation and regulation of mitochondrial malic acid metabolism          in succulent plants with Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM).                    Specifically, regulation of malic acid metabolism in mitochondria               during acidification and deacidification will be examined using in vivo         tracer flux analysis and in vitro studies of mitochondrial metabolism.          On-line methods for monitoring 18O fractionation will be developed to           determine the importance of the alternative respiration pathway for             malate fluxes during the CAM process.                                                                                                                           This research will improve understanding of the physiological                   regulation of CAM metabolism, a biochemical pathway that apparently             helps certain plant species respond to environmental stress.  The               results will also be applicable to other physiological processes in             which malic acid plays a key role such as generation of osmotic                 pressure during stomatal opening and ionic balance during nutrient              uptake and incorporation.  Finally this research will develop direct            measurements of alternative pathway respiration, a key physiological            response thought to provide plants with flexibility in the face of              environmental fluctuation.",
