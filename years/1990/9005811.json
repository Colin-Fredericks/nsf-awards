 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research analyzes the changes in the official Chinese                      attitude towards traditional Tibetan medicine as functions of                   changes in the larger social-political context of Tibet within                  Chinese society.  The study will examine the role of traditional                medicine in Tibet through analysis of health policy and the                     social organization of healing institutions.  Methods include                   systematic interviews with officials in the ministry of health,                 interviews with and observations of practitioners and of patients               of traditional as well as modern medicine, and observation of a                 sample of practitioner-patient interactions.                                                                                                                    This project is important because it will analyze a case of                     medical pluralism that has generalizing implications for other                  social situations where cultures are in contact.  For example,                  understanding the issues of medical behavior in this Tibetan case               can sensitize planners to important issues in the design of                     treatment regimes for other multi-cultural medical situations,                  such as the American southwest.",
