 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is concerned with the effects of residential                       density, its effects on psychological health (broadly defined),                 and the ways in which social support can mediate this                           relationship.  The PI will investigate (via longitudinal survey                 techniques) the psychological health, social support system, and                social withdrawal of people in residences of varying crowdedness.               The survey will be repeated (with the same sample of respondents)               at 3 and 6 months.  After the first interview, respondents in the               extreme quartiles (or population density) will be asked to                      participate in laboratory research (at 6 and 16 weeks post                      initial interview).  The experiments creatively investigate these               people's chronic physiological stress level, the extent to which                they affiliate with others in similar straits, and their ability                to seek and receive  social support.  This proposal attacks the                 effects of density at both the social psychological and the                     psychophysiological levels.  It promises to tell us much about                  the effects of social support on people's reaction to stressful                 environments.  Its contributions to both theory and application                 should be enormous.",
