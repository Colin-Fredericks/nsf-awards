 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pliocene-aged \"Pinecrest Sand\" of southwestern Florida is                   possibly unique in the abundance density and diversity of fossil                mollusks it contains.  The Pinecrest is today exposed only in                   man-made excavations and these excavations are often very short-                lived.  Two pit complexes are exceptions.  The pits of APAC                     Florida, Inc. and Quality Aggregates, Inc. are extensive, long-                 standing operations which give ample opportunity for sampling and               examination of fossiliferous strata in situ.  The APAC pit,                     however, is due to be closed and reclaimed as a lake by early to                mid-1991.  Although the Quality Aggregates operation will                       continue beyond this date, individual pits are in the process of                being reclaimed right now.  Extensive sampling and preliminary                  interpretation of the taxonomy and distribution of the gastropods               in the Pinecrest sand exposed in these pits will be conducted                   before their reclamation makes further study impossible.",
