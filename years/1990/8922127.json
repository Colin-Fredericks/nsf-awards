The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Terry E. Whitledge is fully qualified to                  direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                        equipment.                                                                                                                                                      This project will allow the institution to acquire a block for                  improved wire handling, two SSB radios, a cellular phone, and a                 satellite communications unit, to upgrade communications between                ship and shore stations, an electronic gas detector to replace an               antique flame safety lamp and a weather station for the pilot                   house.",
