 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, there has been a heated debate                       surrounding the potential beneficial effects of herbivores on                   plants.  Up to now, the problem of resolving the question as to                 whether herbivory could ever be good for plants has been that                   convincing data have not been published.                                        However, recent experimental and observational studies showed                   that when mule deer and elk browsed the monocarpic biennial,                    scarlet gillia, Ipomopsis aggregata, relative fitness in terms of               seed production and subsequent seedling survival averaged 2.4                   times that of the uneaten contols.                                              In light of these results, over compensation cannot be easily                   dismissed, although more information is needed on potential                     beneficial effects of herbivores on plants.  It is necessary to                 understand the interactions between plants and their herbivores                 at many levels in much greater detail.  The goals of this project               are: 1. To examine the long-term fitness effects of herbivory; 2.               To examine the effects of secondary herbivory on plant growth and               reproduction; 3. To determine if there are selection pressures                  other than herbivory potentially involved in producing the                      observed response patterns (e.g., fire and frost damage); 4. To                 initiate molecular genetic studies in an effort to understand                   some of the potential genetic mechanisms involved in                            overcompensation; and 5. To begin comparative studies on two                    additional diverse sites to see how common overcompensation by                  scarlet gilia is and to begin to understand something of the                    evolution of such a response.                                                   The results of these studies have the potential for making                      important contributions to both basic and applied fields of                     ecology, evolutionary biology and agriculture.",
