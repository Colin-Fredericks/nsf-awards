 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central emphasis of the human genome project is at the                        present time on the development of novel physical and                           biochemical technologies for genome mapping.  Such methods                      will involve not only means of obtaining direct base pair by                    base pair sequences but also the generation of lower                            resolution large scale physical maps that will make it                          possible to arrange the individual blocks of sequences into                     a single map.                                                                                                                                                   The purpose of this meeting is to bring together experts from                   Europe, Japan and the United States in order to examine and                     evaluate new approaches and needed developments of genome                       technologies and methods.  Areas which will specifically be                     examined include the use of various imaging technologies for                    the generation of genomic maps.  Light and electron                             microscopic imaging will be examined  as well as scanning                       tunneling EM to directly map DNA. These methods will be                         compared to others such as the semi-automated gel                               electrophoretic methods.  Nucleic acid tagging methodologies                    will also be examined.  The hope is that critical examination                   of the advantages and disadvantages of these different methods                  will lead to a consensus on which should be pursued further.                                                                                                    The combination of overview presentations, talks on specific                    areas, and workshops, all of which will occur in this meeting,                  should provide a much clearer picture of where the current                      focus of mapping is and how individual efforts as well as the                   study of other animal and plant genomes fit into the larger                     picture.  Given the international character of this meeting,                    Alaska, which is easily accessible and attractive for                           American, European and Japanese researchers and policy makers,                  is an ideal setting for this conference.",
