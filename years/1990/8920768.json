 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four postdoctoral research mathematicians will study various               aspects of dynamical systems under the direction of the principal               investigator.  Three of the investigators will study various                    aspects of circle dynamics.  These include studies of rotation                  number, the renormalization operator for smooth maps with flat                  spots, hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator, and the                   Sullivan program for circle endomorphisms.  The fourth                          investigator will study one parameter families of unimodal and                  multimodal maps of the interval.  Uniqueness properties of                      kneading sequences will be investigated.                                             Orbits of points which are carried around a circle with                    given asymptotic rotation have interested mathematicians working                in dynamical systems for most of the century.  In recent years,                 first Collette and Eckman, and then Feigenbaum made the study of                renormalization famous with their discovery of the \"Feigenbaum                  constant\" for period-doubling bifurcations.  This \"constant of                  nature\" has been observed in a wide variety of physical                         phenomena.  These research mathematicians will study deep aspects               of the renormalization operator applied to functions of the                     circle and the interval.",
