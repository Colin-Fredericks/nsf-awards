The focus of this project is to study the effects                       of pounding of adjacent structures against each other                           based on the actual damage observations.                                                                                                                        The objectives are: (1) to survey the frequency and types                       of pounding that occurred, (2) to evaluate analytically                         the effects of pounding on several buildings that had                           observed structural damage from pounding, (3) to                                investigate the adverse effects of pounding, and (4) to                         provide engineers with guidance to mitigate  the damage                         from pounding.                                                                                                                                                  The expected research results:  a summary of observed                           damage due to pounding, and analytical investigation to                         correlate with actual observed pounding damage, a proposed                      modeling procedure and a design method for buildings                            subjected to pounding, and a method of mitigating pounding                      damage on existing adjacent buildings.                                                                                                                          This study will lead to a better understanding of the                           phenomena and proper ways to mitigate the damages in                            connection with pounding.",
