 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cardiovascular disorders are the leading medical cause of                  disability and deaths in the United States.  For example,                       systemic arterial hypertension afflicts approximately 20% of the                adult population, and is the prime cause of congestive heart                    failure, stroke, and renal disease.  It is known that the lower                 brain stem, particularly its medulla oblongata portion, plays a                 primary role in the central governance of vital visceral                        functions.  Hence, Dr. Hirsch will concentrate his research                     efforts on neurons within this important brain region.  Using                   innovative chemical neuroanatomical and physiological                           methodologies, he will determine which population of medullary                  cells synthesize and co-localize the neurotransmitters                          thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and serotonin (5-HT).  In                   addition, Dr. Hirsch will determine how these chemical messengers               differentially regulate peripheral arterial blood pressure, heart               rate, and glandular release of adrenaline-related hormones.  The                long-term goals of his multidisciplinary program is to provide                  the basis research necessary for the development of novel                       medicinal pharmaceutical agents to ameliorate these crippling and               life-threatening human illnesses.",
