 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primacy of ATP for the energization of primary ion transport                is universally accepted.  Cation-translocating ATPases, capable                 of pumping H+, Na+, K+ and Ca2+, have been found in virtually all               living cells and are recognized to be of paramount importance for               cellular function.  One notable exception, however, is the H+-                  translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase) of higher                    plant vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) which utilizes inorganic                    pyrophosphate (PPi), instead of ATP, as energy source.  This                    enzyme, the first example of a PPi-dependent H+ pump in any \"non-               energy coupling\" membrane, is a major vacuolar membrane component               and capable of generating a H+-electrochemical potential                        difference of +200mV.  The tonoplast PPase is therefore                         quantitatively significant at both the protein and functional                   levels and amenable to molecular characterization.                                                                                                              This research provides for (i) the determination of the amino                   acid sequence of the Mr64,000 substrate-binding subunit of the                  enzyme, and (ii) the enumeration of the components constituting                 the functionally integral pump and elucidation of their                         respective roles.  Objective (i) provides insights into the                     evolutionary origins of this novel translocase and facilitate the               modeling of its organization on the membrane.  Objective (ii), on               the other hand, provides an independent test of the models                      derived from the sequence data and facilitate identification of                 the structural                                                                  elements responsible for mediating both substrate hydrolysis and                H+-translocation.  The ubiquity of the tonoplast PPase in plant                 cells and the unique status of PPi as the limiting case of a high               energy phosphate will make the results obtained of broad                        bioenergetic significance.                                                                                                                                      The vacuolar membrane (tonoplast) of higher plant cells contains                an enzyme called a H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase.                  This enzyme is ubiquitous in higher plants and contributes to the               establishment and maintenance of a transmembrane electrochemical                potential difference.  This electrochemical potential difference,               in turn, is necessary for the transport of other solutes.  Since                little is known about this important enzyme, studies are being                  carried out to obtain knowlegde of its evolutionary origins,                    organization and physiological functions.",
