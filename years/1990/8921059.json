 "awd_abstract_narration": "Attempts to explain what caused the stock market crashes around                 the world in October, 1987 have suffered from the paucity of                    major economic developments occurring around that time that could               have triggered the crashes.  Shifting expectations regarding                    monetary policy, foreign investors' fears of a dollar decline,                  increasing riskiness of assets--none of these appeared major                    enough, if at all, to explain the magnitude of the crashes. The                 purpose of this project is to determine whether the climate of                  investor expectations before the crash was such that these                      expectations, in and of themseleves, could have been a major                    factor in causing the crash.                                                                                                                                    Transactions data for stock-option futures traded on the Chicago                Mercantile Exchange will be analyzed to investigate the nature of               these expectations.  These data should be especially informative                in this regard because, theoretically, there should be a close                  relationship between option prices and underlying asset prices.                 For example, a significant probability of a market crash will                   lead to relatively high prices for put options that pay off only                when the stock market falls substantially.  This project will                   glean new insights from the options data about expectations of a                market crash.  This research is important because it should                     corroborate or discredit the hypothesis that the crash was a                    self-fulfilling prophesy--i.e., that the market crashed because                 investors simply viewed it as over valued and expected a crash.",
