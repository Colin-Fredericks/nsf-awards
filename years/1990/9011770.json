Two newly developed correlation methods will be used to                         calculate excitation energies and potential energy curves for a                 variety of systems where significant mixing of zeroth order                     states is encountered in excited states.  Three classes of                      systems will be studied: Rydberg states of homonuclear and                      heteronuclear diatomic molecules; reactions of electronically                   excited zinc with atomic and molecular partners; and polyene                    cations and cyclic conjugated species.  Comparison will be made                 between configuration interaction treatments of excited states                  and the two newly developed correlation methods.",
