 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in urban and                     regional planning between Dr. John Kim, University of Illinois                  at Urbana and Dr. Lars Lundqvist, Royal Institute of Technology,                Stockholm, Sweden.  The proposed research will address specific                 issues in building and applying a land-use transportation                       planning model appropriate for Sweden, where a strong mixed                     economic system prevails.                                                                                                                                       The usual view in a mixed economy is that some goods and                        services are produced privately, and some, such as transportation,              are produced publicly.  Most existing transportation development                planning models designed to shed light on development policy in                 mixed economic systems miss this essential normative issue,                     i.e., the interaction between the private and the public                        sectors.  Because of its mixed economy, Sweden provides an ideal                environment for testing the applicability of a transportation                   model with explicit provisions of public-private interaction.                   Provisions for interaction between the public and private                       sectors in planning models will shed light on the important                     issues necessary for planning investment strategies. Private                    institutions, such as households and entrepreneurs, produce and                 consume goods and services in pursuing their parochial interests,               while the public sector in a typical mixed economic system                      attempts to broaden public interests.  The importance of modelling              public-private interaction becomes particularly apparent when                   one deals with national issues, such as investment priority for                 transportation development. The objectives of the proposed                      project include evaluating how a land-use transportation                        planning model with specific public-private policy issues, such                 as finding the optimum investment amounts and setting investment                priorities for providing infrastructure in mixed economic                       systems, using Sweden as a case study site.  Results of this                    study will contribute to the fields of transportation, land use                 and regional science by building a normative theory of how                      resources should be allocated in  mixed economic systems and how                transportation and land resources should be allocated efficiently.",
