 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies determinants of entry into and exit from                   family-related adult roles, including marital and premarital                    child birth, marriage, separation, and cohabitation.  It goes                   beyond previous methodology by distinguishing between deter-                    minants of the timing of events and determinants of the                         lifetime probability of the events.  Previous methods cannot                    distinguish timing and probability, so, for                                     example, they cannot tell whether a higher divorce rate means                   members in the population are generally more likely to experience               divorce, or whether they just experience it earlier than                        members of some other population.  The PI has developed new                     methods and models to see, for example, whether certain risk                    factors associated with high divorce rates cause higher probabil-               ities or accelerate the timing of divorce for those couples who                 will eventually divorce.   Software developed for this project                  will be available for use by other investigators using similar                  large data sets.",
