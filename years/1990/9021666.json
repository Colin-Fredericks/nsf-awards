 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clathrates are ice-like, crystalline solids composed of water and               low molecular weight gas molecules.  Because of the unique                      pressure and temperature fields in which they are stable,                       clathrates tend to be abundant in continental slope and rise                    sediments in the deep sea.  The resulting precipitation of solid                clathrates within marine sediments is detectable from the                       occurrence of bottom-parallel reflectors which are visible in                   seismic reflection records, are generally parallel to the ocean                 bottom, and cut across other sediment reflections.  The bottom                  parallel reflector apparently represents the base of the                        clathrate stability field.  Below this reflector the clathrate                  decomposes into fresh water and dissolved gas.                                                                                                                  Few pristine samples of clathrates from the deep-sea have ever                  been fully analyzed, since the clathrates tends to decompose                    rapidly when brought to the sea surface. Recently the Ocean                     Drilling Program has developed a pressure core barrel which is                  capable of retrieving a one meter long sample of marine sediment                and returning the material to the drillship under in situ                       pressure.  During a recent engineering test of this system, an                  undisturbed sample was recovered from the Nankai Trench.  the                   present award will support preliminary development of the                       necessary analytical techniques to examine this unexpected sample               important in fully documenting chemical reactions and conditions                and in evaluating the release of clathrates gasses to the                       atmosphere during sea-level changes.",
