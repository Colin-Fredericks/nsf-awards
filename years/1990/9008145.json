 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide support for purchase of                             engineering research equipment.  The equipment to be                            purchased consists of an optical particle counter, image                        analysis system and a fermenter coupled with a probe for                        measurement of dissolved-oxygen concentrations.  The                            investigators plan to use this equipment in three separate                                                                                                      projects.  One involves oxidant interactions with mineral                       and bio-particles in promoting particle destabilization                         and growth during chemical coagulation.  The second deals                       with concepts of fractals, fractal geometry and dimensions                                                                                                      in characterizing biological aggregates and factors                             affecting their aggregation.  The third addresses bio-                          colloids and conditions and factors that affect their                           transport in groundwater flowing through subsurface,                            porous media.                                                                                                                                                   The proposal leading to this award was submitted in                             response to Program Announcement NSF 87-68, Engineering                         Research Equipment Grants.  In addition to utility of the                       equipment for conduct of the research outlined in the                           proposal, the equipment will also add to the educational                        capabilities of the Environmental Engineering Program at                        the University of Arizona.",
