In 1990 12                         undergraduates, selected from a nationwide group of applicants,                 will conduct independent hands-on research for 9 weeks in the                   summer under the direct supervision of staff scientists.  Working               in their sponsors' laboratories, the students conduct original                  basic research on problems in mammalian genetics and development                that are components of their sponsors' on-going research programs.              Students gain experience in all aspects of doing a research                     project, from project design to reporting the results.  Inbred and              mutant laboratory mice are utilized in many projects.  All students             are from outside the host institution; about half are from                      baccalaureate colleges.  Students with a wide range of science                  preparation are accepted, with each participant's research project              tailored to his or her individual background and interests.  The                students' work at the bench is supplemented by organized group                  educational activities, including a formal symposium.  Follow-up                activities are in place to help foster the students' continuing                 interest in science and research.  Informal studies of program                  alumni indicate that a very high percentage receive doctoral                    degrees in the biological sciences or medicine.",
