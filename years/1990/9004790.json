 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate juvenile glassy tephra from the                   nuee-ardente deposits produced the cataclysmic eruptions on                     Montagne Pelee in 1902, as a basis for interpretation of the role               of hydrovolcanism in the eruption dynamics of this cycle of                     activity.  The research is undertaken specifically to provide                   sharper insights into the physical processes responsible for such               large and devastating explosive eruptions.  Electron microprobe                 (EMP), scanning electron microscope (SEM), image analysis, and                  size distribution analysis will be the main techniques used to                  investigate tephra deposits left by the passage of successive                   nuees ardentes or sediment gravity flows in the vicinity of St.                 Pierre, Martinique.  Internal and surficial textural information                observed on juvenile vitric fragments from the nuee ardente                     deposits will shed light on (1) processes of magma                              vesiculavesiculation and fragmentamentation as a result of sion                 of juvenile magmatic volatiles; (2) the role and timing of                      hydromagmatism during the eruption; (3) the genesis of nuee                     ardentes; and (4) the mechanics of particle-particle interaction                during transtransport and deposition of nuee-ardente tephra.                    Grain size distribution analysis using the new model of                         sequential fragmentation and transport will allow the                           identification of maturity of fragmentation and transportation                  processes to be evaluated for various parts of the nuees at                     various distances from the source.  This information should be                  extremely useful in the evaluation of volcanic hazards at                       volcanoes with a history of large expolosions such as those of                  Montagne Pelee.",
