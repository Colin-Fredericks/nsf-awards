 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economical solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells (SPEFCs) have                   potential commercial applications for example as auxiliary                      power fuel cell systems for cruise ships, offshore platforms,                   and remote navigation systems.  Compared to other currently                     used electricity generating systems, fuel cells offer many                      advantages, including (1) high fuel to electricity conversion                   efficiency at both rated and part load; (2) molecular                           construction; and (3) low pollutant levels.  A major                            impediment to the commercialization of SPEFC is the high cost                   of the unsupported platinum electrocalyst.  In this work PIs                    plan to develop high utilization pulse plated carbon supported                  electrocatalysts for SPEFC applications which reduce the                        platinum cost substantially relative to the state-of-art.                                                                                                       Using their Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I                   grant, the PIs demonstrated a ten-fold decrease in platinum                     cost.  Their high utilization electrocatalyst concept is based                  on Nafion impregnation of a carbon gas diffusion electrode                      followed by pulse current catalyzation (PCC) with platinum.                     They electrodeposit small platinum catalyst particles (30                       angstrom) only in regions with electronic and ionic                             accessibility.  The platinum utilization in this                                electrocatalyst is therefore high.  Because a major impediment                  to the commercialization of SPEFCs is the high cost of the                      platinum electrocatalyst, this technique could be an enabling                   technology for commercially viable electrocatalysts for SPEFC.                  Another potential application for their Nafion impregrated                      electrocatalyst is for poisoning resistant oxygen sensing                       electrodes.  Currently the electrocatalyst used as a cathode                    for oxygen sensing is poisoned by a soluble lead species from                   the anode.  Since Nafion is a proton selective membrane, this                   electrode will retard the transport and poisoning of the                        oxygen sensing cathode by lead.  This is an SBIR Phase II                       grant.",
