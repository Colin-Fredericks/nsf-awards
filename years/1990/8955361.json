Because                of the importance of Antarctica in relation to global                           environmental systems the exhibit will explore the physical                     connections between the continent and the rest of the world, as                 well as some of the scientific, political and economic issues and               choices that will affect its future and ours as well.                                                                                                           The exhibit will contain traditional displays of geological,                    biological and other museums specimens, historical and                          contemporary photographs, models, dioramas and descriptive text,                as well as interactive displays and video.  The museum will                     develop the exhibit in association with the Science Museum                      Exhibit Collaborative, among whose eight members the                            exhibit will circulate beginning in the spring of 1991.",
