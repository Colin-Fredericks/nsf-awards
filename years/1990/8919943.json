 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain activity is the combined effect of excitatory and                         inhibitory nerve cells acting in concert.  An imbalance of their                activities can result in neurological problems such as stress,                  anxiety or even seizures.                                                                                                                                       The major inhibitory system in the brain is composed of nerve                   cells which release a chemical signaling molecule, gamma-                       aminobutyric acid (GABA).  This compound acts on other nerve                    cells by inhibiting their activity.  Many drugs that are used as                sedatives, anti-anxiety agents or anti-epileptics are thought to                act by increasing the activity of the GABA inhibitory nerve                     cells.                                                                                                                                                          This research project will investigate the control of the GABA                  inhibitory system.  There is some evidence that an enzyme,                      phospholipase A2, interferes with the proper function of the GABA               system.  This project will test whether the activation of this                  enzyme negatively influences the GABA inhibitory nerve cells.                   The results could provide insight into the factors contributing                 to stress, anxiety and seizures and help identify therapeutic                   approaches for the treatment of these ailments.",
