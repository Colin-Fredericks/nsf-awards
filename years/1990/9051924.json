 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth Sciences Department has made significant commitments toward           strengthening its program in meteorology. Recent additions to the               faculty, curriculum, and equipment have initiated the process. This             project allows for significant improvement in the quality of the                program by providing improvements and increased access to the                   meteorological data used. The department's use of the UNIDATA PC-MCIDAS         service is being expanded by the addition of terminals and a                    filesaver/storage unit to create a local area network open to students.         Additional components incude a microcomputer based system for receiving         National Weather Service DIFAX map service and high resolution monitors         for display of computer terminal images to laboratory discussion                groups. This equipment and the resulting data provides students and             faculty with complete access to a wide range of meteorological                  observations, analyzed products, and forecasts for North America.               Successful implementation of the project will result in an up-to-date           undergraduate meteorology program for Minnesota students.                       The university will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
