 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Teacher Training in the Observational Sciences at the George                   Observatory\" is a comprehensive three-year program to teach                     twenty teachers per year techniques actually used in research                   in the physical and ecological sciences.  This program will                     them experiences that present science as a process rather                       than a collection of facts.  The Observatory, situated at                       Brazos Bend State Park, is an ideal site for both                               astronomical and ecological study, with a 36' telescope in                      the Research Dome, smaller telescopes in the East and West                      Domes, a heliostat (solar observatory), and an ecology                          laboratory to study flora, fauna and environmental conditions                   on the 5000-acre park site.  The teachers will participate,                     in pairs, in ongoing research programs guided by a research                     mentor (faculty members or professional scientists at Rice                      University, the Houston Museum of Natural Science, or other                     Houston institutions).  The first week will comprise lectures                   by each mentor to the entire group, presenting science                          background and outlining research techniques that are used                      both in general and for the specific research project.  The                     teachers (working in pairs) can then make an educated choice                    of which project to work on.  Assigned to each project will                     be a Research Assistant, who will accompany each pair of                        teachers at all times during the data gathering phase of the                    research (60 hours, spread over a  maximum of seven weeks)                      and will be responsible for the safe operation of all                           equipment.  In addition, a student programmer will work with                    each pair of teachers to create a customized research                           database most compatible with the teachers' computers at                        their home schools.  In this way, the teachers can continue                     to add to their own databases with their own pupils adding                      new data each year, either at local sites or as field trips                     to the Observatory.  Participants in the program may earn                       three semester hours of graduate credit.  The program begins                    in the summer of 1990.                                                                                                                                          The research projects include galactic and stellar astronomy,                   nebular astrophotography, solar observation, light and air                      pollution studies, acid rain studies, population studies of                     both plants and animals, weather observations, tree growth                      observations, etc.  The teachers will be required to write up                   a report covering the techniques used and results found.                        Each teacher will take home with them videotapes of all ten                     lectures plus copies of all ten reports, so that the teachers                   can replicate with their school classes any of the ten                          research projects.  In this way the transference to the                         classroom is maximized.                                                                                                                                         Cost sharing in the amount of $46,773 equals 15% of the NSF                     award.",
