 "awd_abstract_narration": "RR Lyrae variables are a group of pulsating stars that occur in                 old regions of the Galaxy, such as in globular clusters and the                 general galactic halo.  Because these variable stars are all                    known to have nearly the same luminosity, they were first used as               \"standard candles\" by Harlow Shapley earlier this century to                    determine the distance from the Sun to the Galaxy's center.                     Moreover, since many of these stars are thought to have been                    formed during the early stages of the Galaxy's collapse soon                    after the Big Bang, their age is important in determining the age               of the Universe.  Recent work has shown that the luminosities of                RR Lyrae stars have a residual dependence after all on their                    metal content and age.  Additionally, there is an important                     standing controversy over whether globular clusters were all                    formed soon after the Big Bang or over an extended period of                    time.  To resolve these issues requires a careful determination                 of the incidence of these stars among various globular clusters,                the distribution of their periods, and the dependence of their                  luminosiites on their surface temperatures.                                                                                                                     Past efforts to improve our knowledge of the properties of RR                   Lyrae stars have been hampered by their faintness and their                     crowding together in dense star conglomerates in the sky.  The                  Principle Investigator proposes to monitor the luminosity                       variations of a large number of RR Lyrae stars in metal-poor and                metal-rich globular clusters to separate out the residual                       dependences of these physical characteristics.  The Investigator                will use a modern Charge Coupled Device on a small telescope to                 perform this work.  Such devices are sensitive even to small                    variations in light output.  Additionally, because many star                    images may be focussed independently on the detector surface, one               may use non-variable stars on the same image to subtract out                    changes in sensitivity caused by instabilities in the instrument                and the Earth's atmosphere.",
