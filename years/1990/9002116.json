 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in deformation theory and                 arithmetic groups of Professor John Millson of the University of                Maryland at College Park. Dr. Millson has proposed to work in two               main areas: first, he will apply the methods of rational homotopy               theory to deformation problems in algebraic geometry; and second,               he will continue his research on the cohomology of discrete                     subgroups of orthogonal and unitary groups.                                          This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                        robotics.",
