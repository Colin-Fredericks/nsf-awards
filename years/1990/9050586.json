 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the improvement of the chemistry                    program through the utilization of a gas chromatograph-Fourier                  Transform Infrared Spectrometer system.  Hyphenated techniques                  such as the GC-FTIR are commonly used in graduate school and                    industry; the chemistry department is providing an example of                   coupled equipment for their students as well as giving them the                 opportunity for hands on experience.  The faculty have approached               the task in a three-phase plan developed a few years back:  the                 purchase of the FTIR, the subsequent purchase of the GC, followed               by the interfacing of the two pieces of equipment.  Although the                GC and FTIR are coupled, through the use of computer controlled                 swing-away mirror, they can be used independently.                                                                                                              The combined system is allowing the investigation of complex                    mixtures that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to                     undertake at the undergraduate level.  The GC-FTIR also lends                   itself readily to the techniques of the newly-established micro-                organic chemistry program.  The courses most directly affected by               the acquisition of the GC-FTIR are the two-semester Organic                     Chemistry sequence, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Instrumental                    Analysis, and Senior Research.                                                                                                                                  The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
