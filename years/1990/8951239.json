 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for equipment to teach an undergraduate               laboratory course in plant biotechnology at Arizona State                       University.  The course, Plant Genetic Manipulation Laboratory,                 is currently being offered only to graduate students.  Its                      present enrollment is closed to undergraduates because of                       limitations in equipment.  Plant Genetic Manipulation Laboratory                (BOT 498) is a 2-credit, 1 semester course, which meets twice a                 week for a total of 6 hours.  Students are trained in the                       isolation and purification of DNA, RNA and proteins from plants.                They prepare DNA gels, Southern blots, protein gels and Western                 blots.  They learn recombinant DNA techniques (restriction,                     ligation, vector construction), bacterial transformation and                    selection, plant transformation (using Agrobacterium tumefaciens                based vectors and electroporation) and are taught basic plant                   tissue culture techniques.  The equipment for this project                      includes items found in all molecular biology labs sufficient to                train 10 to 15 students per lab in teams of 2-3 students.                                                                                                       Training in this subject is in demand by students who will                      benefit from the practical laboratory experience.  It will also                 benefit ASU scientists and faculty who are seeking undergraduates               and potential graduate students trained in these areas. This is                 particularly relevant now at ASU with the expansion and opening                 of laboratories which are part of the new USDA-DOE-NSF Plant                    Science Center for the Early Events in Photosynthesis.  The                     grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
