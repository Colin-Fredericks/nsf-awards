 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knight intends to continue to work on problems in recursive                model theory, and to analyze methods for organizing and thinking                about nested priority arguments.  There are now several such                    methods:  the method of \"workers\", developed by Harrington, two                 versions of \"alpha-systems\", both developed by Ash, and a method                of Lemmp and Lerman.  The method of workers and the original                    alpha-systems have each yielded quite a number of results in                    recursive model theory.                                                              Knight has a metatheorem for workers, similar to the one Ash               proved for his original alpha-systems, except that not so much is               assumed to be r.e., and the conditions are more complicated.                    Knight hopes both to simplify and to improve the metatheorem for                workers.  In Knight's metatheorem, as in Ash's original                         metatheorem, the object produced on the bottom is recursive.                    Ash's new alpha-systems (simpler than the old), and the method of               Lemmp and Lerman, are designed to produce an r.e. object on the                 bottom.  There are many problems in recursive model theory                      (existence of recursive presentations of groups, etc.), as well                 as in recursion theory, on which these new methods ought to yield               results.                                                                             Recursion theory as a topic in the foundations of                          mathematics is motivated by a desire to formalize the property of               being computable by an algorithm.  The algorithm need not be a                  practical one, but it must exist and terminate in principal after               some finite number of steps.",
