 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two goals of this proposal are to extend some known results                for the uniform random mapping model to other interesting random                mapping models, and to initiate new research on probabilistic                   optimization problems.  The work on random mapping models is a                  continuation of work already completed by the principal                         investigator.  In particular, the principal investigator is                     interested in determining new central limit theorems and                        functional limit theorem for certain random mapping models.  The                investigation of probabilistic optimization problems is related                 to the study of random mapping models, as both rely, in various                 ways, on the theory of random graphs.  Since the second topic of                this proposal is a new area of research for the investigator, the               planning activities that will be carried out are primarily                      intended to prepare the proposer to work independently in this                  field.",
