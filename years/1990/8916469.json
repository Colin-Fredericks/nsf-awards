 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of volcanic products along the Andes show a variation in                chemistry along strike and across strike with time.  These                      variations can be explained by two contrasting models; (1) that                 the chemical variations simply reflect variations in the mantle                 source (primary magmas are not modified by interaction with the                 lithosphere); or (2) that these variations are due to                           modification of primary magmas due to interaction with the                      lithosphere through which they pass.                                            In the Central Andes, the similarity of the compositions of the                 erupted andesites to typical continental crust, has led to the                  suggestion that these reflect the direct mantle to curst flux,                  and support a model for crustal growth through magmatic addition                at the subduction zone  Crustal thicknesses in the Central Andes                reach~70km, and it is difficult to envisage that primary magmas                 would not be modified en route to the surface.  The alternative                 interpretation is that Andean andesites are chemically similar to               continental crust because they have been extensively contaminated               by the crust.                                                                   This project will address this key issue by studying mafic                      monogenetic centres in Bolivia.  Available data suggests that                   these are the least differentiated lavas in the Central Andes and               have 87SR/86SR similar to the source of island arc magmas.  They                therefore represent the closest examples to primary magmas in the               Central Andes, and appear to be a vital window into the                         composition of the sub-Andean mantle.",
