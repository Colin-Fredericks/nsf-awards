 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fatty acid synthesis is required for several diverse roles in                   plants including an essential housekeeping function in the                      synthesis of membranes in every cell, and specialized                           developmental and organ-specific functions in the production                    of seed storage oils and surface protective waxes.  The long                    term goal of this project is to understand how plants                           regulate fatty acid biosynthesis at both biochemical and gene                   expression levels to meet these diverse roles.  This research                   provides information on three fronts:  1. Identification of                     the rate determining/regulatory steps which provide short                       term control over rates of fatty acid synthesis.  2.                            Examination of the structure, organization and regulation of                    fatty acid synthase (FAS) genes is to be done using acyl                        carrier protein (ACP) as a model.  3. Evaluation will be made                   of the possible physiological role of multiple ACP isoforms                     by over-expression of their genes and antisense inhibition of                   their expression in transgenic plants.                                                                                                                          In addition to their major role in the structure and function                   of all cell membranes, plant fats represent a vast renewable                    resource.  Annual world production of plant oils is                             approximately 60 million metric tons with a value of more                       than $20 billion.  In the U.S., about two-thirds of all plant                   oil is consumed by humans and animals.  In the American diet,                   plant oils have gradually tended to replace animal fats and                     now accout for 15-20% of total calories consumed.  In                           addition, plant oils are employed in the manufacture of a                       range of specialty products including lubricants, plastics                      and detergents.  Despite the major economic and nutritional                     significance of plant fats, there has been comparatively                        little research into the regulation of their biosynthesis.                      This research investigates the expression of certain genes                      required for fat synthesis by plants as well as points of                       metabolic control in one specific case.***//",
