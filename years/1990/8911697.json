 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thrust of this work will be able to use available tracer                    data to set quantitative limits on a number of biogeochemically                 important processes in the subtropical ocean.  The fundamental                  problem that will be attacked is the apparent mismatch between                  the more \"conventional\" estimates of primary production and the                 geochemical tracer estimates recently proposed (eg Jenkins,                     1982; Jenkins and Goldman, 1985; Jenkins, 1988; Spitzer and                     Jenkins, 1989).  On hand is an extended time series of tracer                   data and maps of the large scale distribution of many of these                  tracers that reuires interpretation.  The PI plans to do the                    following:                                                                      %%%                                                                                                                                                                 1.  Using existing time series tracer data combined with                    upper ocean prognostic and inverse modelling, estimates of gas                  exchange rates, vertical mixing, nutrient transport and new                     primary production in oligotrophic waters will be made.                         %%%                                                                                                                                                                 2.  Using knowledge of large scale tracer distributions the                 problems associated with lateral processes influencing the                      essentially one dimensional natue of the time series data will                  be addressed.                                                                   %%%                                                                                                                                                                 3.  A simple stochastic model will be employed to study the                 problems of timescale mismatch associated with comparison of                    conventional bottle-incubation techniques and the longer term                   integrating tracer measurements.                                                %%%                                                                                                                                                             This work will result in a series of papers based on the above                  modelling and interpretive efforts which will serve to                          synthesize and extend the tracer based estimates of these                       important processes, and rationalize their comparison with                      other techniques.",
