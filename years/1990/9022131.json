 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to carry out an assessment of scientific and                    technical information (STI) dissemination in the United States.                 There are two phases to the project.  Phase I is to focus on                    estimating and examining the size and characteristics of the demand             for different STI dissemination services by various users and the               magnitude, quality and costs of supplying STI dissemination                     services by various sources.  Phase II, to be performed at the                  option of the NSF after a review of the results of phase I, is to               concentrate on examining private or public actions with a potential             for improving STI dissemination in the United States.                                                                                                           This project will involve largely quantitative analyses using                   available data, which are to be obtained from a variety of sources.             The project team is to design and implement a format for                        integrating these diverse data for effective processing and                     analysis.  Information for project reports are to be derived from               a series of papers describing the results, procedures, and data for             studies on a number of focussed topics.  Final substantive                      coverage, findings and analyses contained in these papers are to                come about from interim drafts, which will be revised in response               to intensive evaluations by outside experts on STI dissemination.               %%%                                                                             The NSF always has been concerned with the nation's capabilities                and performance in disseminating timely information about science               and engineering research results and activities.  Over twenty years             have elapsed since the Federal Government last undertook a                      comprehensive assessment of the dissemination of scientific and                 technical information (STI).  This project is to provide the NSF                with empirical studies and analyses, which, as a group, are to                  constitute a comprehensive examination of current conditions,                   future potentials and policy issues for STI dissemination in the                United States.",
