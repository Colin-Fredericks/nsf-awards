 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Frank R. Stermitz of Colorado                 State University in collaboration with Professor Oscar Castro of                the Centro de Investigacion de Productos Naturales (CIPRONA) in                 Costa Rica.  The investigators intend to extend current research                on the chemistry of alkaloid containing plants and insects                      involved in specialized interactions with these plants.                                                                                                         Insects that specialize on one or a few plant species have to                   overcome chemical defenses elaborated by the host plant.  They may              use chemicals from the plant to fashion pheromones, or defensive                substances, or may have achieved special methods for the metabolism             or elimination of plant chemicals.  The researchers will study                  three sphingid moth species in Guanacaste National Park in Costa                Rica that distribute themselves among three plant species, all in               the family Bignoniaceae.  There does not appear to be any obvious               seasonal or environmental reasons for these special choices of                  hostplant and it is suggested that chemical factors may play a                  part.  Support from the Science in Developing Countries Program                 will allow the collaborators to expand the investigation to other               species as well.                                                                                                                                                The chemical study of plant species utilized by specialist                      insects will be valuable in understanding the evolution of plant                defense and insect specialization.  It has been conservatively                  estimated that over 50% of all biological species are made up of                combination of phytophagous insects and their hostplants.  Thus,                in the long term, understanding of plant-insect interactions will               provide information on a major part of the world's biodiversity.",
