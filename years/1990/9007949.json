 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of research will be initiated to study plasmas                   in the early Universe, when general-relativistic effects due to                 the expansion of the background are significant.  Plasma                        dynamics during this epoch could have important ramifications                   for the theory of galaxy formation and of the origin of                         intergalactic, and possibly also galactic, magnetic fields.                     The synthesis of general relativity and plasma physics is a                     field that is largely untouched, and the cosmological                           implications in particular are mostly unexplored.                                    The simple linear theory of cosmological plasmas has been                  studied in the single-particle approximation and in the                         magnetohydrodynamic limit.  A kinetic approach, based on the                    general-relativistic Boltzmann equation, will be carried out.                   In addition, some nonlinear analysis will be performed.                         However, for most nonlinear phenomena to be studied adequately,                 numerical simulation is necessary.  Because the nonlinear,                      collective effects are among the most interesting, computer                     codes are being developed to investigate such effects.  Many                    applications of these codes are underway or planned, including,                 but not limited to, the study of fluctuations in plasmas in the                 early Universe, the modeling of shock formation and heating due                 to mode interactions or to Alfven waves, and the investigation                  of the effect of dynamo and reconnection mechanisms on the                      origin of galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields.",
