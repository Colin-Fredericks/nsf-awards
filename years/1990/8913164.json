 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous-time analog CMOS circuits are being developed to realize             infinite-impulse-response (IIR) adaptive filters that were recently             developed.  These structures are all based on notch biquads that have           good sensitivity properties and are easy to adapt while guaranteeing            that the filter is stable.  Previous research has concentrated on the           theoretical analysis of these structure, where global convergence was           proved and it was shown the structures have very small biases.  he              future research will focus on the development of the adaptive filters           for practical applications.  These include FM demodulators, frequency-          assisted phase-locked-loops and Costas-loops, carrier and clock-                extraction circuits, efficient channel-banks for spectral analysis and          periodic noise cancellation circuits, to name only a few.                       In many ways, these new circuits represent a generalization of the              phase-locked-loop to the multi-sinusoidal case.  As such, they will be          the first ever analog circuits capable of isolating individual sinusoids        having unknown frequencies from a multisinusoidal input signal, in real-        time.",
