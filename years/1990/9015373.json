 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information is carried through the brain by bundles of nerve                    fibers called tracts.  One of the well-known tracts is that from                the retina of the eye to a region of the midbrain called the                    optic tectum.  Neuroanatomists traditionally trace the                          connections of these tracts, from the cell groups of their origin               to their specific target nerve cells, by using special dyes.  The               tracing requires cutting the brain into thin sections, to examine               the cells microscopically, and reconstruct the three-dimensional                pathway from the series of sections.  In contrast, this study                   will explore a new method, called magnetic resonance imaging                    (MRI), to trace such pathways.  The basic technique is already                  used in clinics as a \"non-invasive\" way of revealing soft brain                 internal structures from human patients, using a computer to                    reconstruct the 3-dimensional images from the machine.  This                    study tests whether magnetic material can be molecularly bound to               be taken up like other tracers by particular pathways in small                  animal brains, and whether the resolution of small features in                  the brain can be achieved satisfactorily.  Then the animal can be               examined with an appropriately scaled MRI machine, and the                      computerized reconstruction of the pathway made, without                        sacrificing the animal at all.  If successful, this pilot study                 will have great                                                                 impact on neuroscience by introducing a fundamentally new way                   of doing neuroanatomy on animals where the physiology is known,                 and will introduce the possibility of repeated neuroanatomical                  study on the same individual by this non-invasive technique.",
