 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) supports simulation            studies of a new architecture for parallel computation.  The new                architecture, mirror memory, is a variation on the snoopy cache                 coherence techniques that are possible in bus-based multiprocessors. A          mirror memory system is a network of processor-memory pairs,                    interconnected by high-speed fiberoptic links.  The processor-memory            interface at each node of the network keeps track of shared variables           that the node has copies of.  Any time the processor writes a new value         for one of these shared variables, the new value is multicast to all            other nodes that have copies of the variable.  This is \"snooping in             reverse\".  In a  normal snoopy cache, the bus interface makes sure that         its own processor has the correct data; in mirror memory, the interface         makes sure that every other processor has the correct data.                                                                                                     Trace simulations based on large-scale scientific programs are being            used to establish the network and interface speeds required for                 transmitting new values, and to determine the effects of hot spots in           large networks.  Detailed simulations of network and interface                  operation determine the effects of proposed mechanisms on program               running times.",
