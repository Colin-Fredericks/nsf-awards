 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1983 and 1984, Dr. Clark Dobbs excavated the Bryan                           archaeological site which is located in the Red Wing region of                  Minnesota.  The site, which is just under a thousand years in                   age, covers an area of more than 20 acres and includes dense                    clusters of features and artifacts.  An approximately 1.6 acre                  area yielded a total of 558 pit features, more than 166,000                     artifacts, and more than 129 kg. of bone and charcoal.                          Excavation indicated that a palisade surrounded the entire site.                Crucial to understanding site function is the need to control its               chronology.  It is necessary to determine whether the entire area               was occupied at a single time and, thus, sustained a large                      population or whether the sites results from smaller numbers of                 individuals who were present for a longer period of time.  With                 National Science Foundation support, Dr. Dobbs will have a series               of carefully selected charcoal samples radiocarbon dated.  High                 precision counting at the University of Washington laboratory                   will permit materials to be dated to within ca. 20 years.                                                                                                       The broader significance of the project lies in what it will                    reveal about the interaction of prehistoric Native American                     groups.  This general time period saw the rise of large chiefdoms               based further South near St. Louis in the Mississippi Valley.                   These \"Mississippian cultures\" constructed large ceremonial                     mounds, engaged in long distance trade, and controlled the labor                of large groups.  It is unclear, however, just how far their                    influence extended and how direct it was.  The Red Wing area was                clearly affected by Mississippian culture, and the hunters and                  gatherers in southern Minnesota were rapidly transformed in a                   short period of time.  This project will help Dr. Dobbs to                      understand how this transformation took place.                                                                                                                  This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of Native American prehistory.  It will also shed                 additional insight on how complex cultures evolve.",
