 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earlier studies have found that 15-21-month-old children often                  develop particular non-linguistic problem-solving abilities at                  about the same time that they develop words that embody the                     concepts to which those abilities are relevant.  Later in life,                 in school, for example, the words children know clearly influence               the kinds of problems they can solve.  This research will explore               whether language can influence cognition in the same fashion even               at this very early age?                                                                                                                                         It turns out that different languages emphasize some types of                   concepts more clearly and saliently than others.  For instance,                 Korean and Japanese place less emphasis on nouns than English                   does and more on verbs.  Children learning Korean and Japanese                  typically learn verb morphology, the way in which verbs change                  their form to reflect tense, person, and the like, earlier than                 English-speakers, but they use fewer nouns.  This learning                      clearly reflects the frequency of these kinds of words in the                   language they hear.  Does this difference in linguistic input                   also affect the development of non-linguistic cognitive                         abilities?  The research will involve testing Korean- and                       Japanese-speaking children longitudinally and cross-sectionally                 and will compare their linguistic and cognitive development to                  that of English speakers.  The children will receive two types of               tasks.  The first kind, tool-use tasks, measure children's                      ability to understand actions and the relations between means and               ends; these concepts typically are embodied by verbs.  The second               is sorting tasks, which measure children's ability to understand                object categories; these concepts are typically embodied by                     nouns.  The children's early words will also be recorded.  If                   there is a tight correlation between the development of                         linguistic abilities and non-linguistic problem-solving abilities               at this early age, then non-linguistic abilities related to                     verbs, such as tool use, will develop earlier in the Korean and                 Japanese speakers, while abilities related to nouns, such as                    object sorting, will develop earlier in the English speakers.                                                                                                   This research potentially has great relevance to early-childhood                education.  Children are increasingly entering school from                      environments in which a language other than English is the                      predominant if not exclusive medium of communication.  The                      results of this line of research should help preschools to deal                 with these normal children whose pattern of developed abilities                 would not be the same as that of children from monolingual                      English-speaking environments.",
