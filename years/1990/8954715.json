 "awd_abstract_narration": "The critically acclaimed film \"STAND AND DELIVER\"                          accomplished the formidable task of focusing national attention                 on the achievements of minority students in higher mathematics.                 As a motivational tool for educators, the film's value can                      hardly be overstated.                                                                                                                                                \"STAND AND DELIVER\" will now have a second life as a play                  for the stage.  The intimate human drama of the story of Jaime                  Escalante and his inner city A.P. calculus class will be re-                    written and confined to one set - a classroom - making it a                     natural for the theatre.  Best of all, junior and senior high                   schools already have the resources to stage a first-rate                        production.  Since almost all the roles depict students and                     teachers, \"STAND AND DELIVER\" should be a natural choice for                    school drama clubs across the country.                                                                                                                               The transformation of the movie into a play will take                      place in three stages: First, the screenplay is adapted into a                  stage play.  Second, the initial stage production is mounted.                   Third, the play is published and made available to schools and                  theatre companies for local performances.",
