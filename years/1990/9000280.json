 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical investigations in the                  field of ordinary differential equations.  The object is to study               the formal power series solutions of algebraic differential                     equations.  Specifically, the work will concentrate on power                    series of Gevrey type in which the coefficients are not greater                 than certain bounds depending only on the index of the                          coefficient and a single parameter.  The source of the questions                undertaken here is a paper of 1903 which gives conditions on a                  equation which ensure that a solution may be expressed by such a                power series.  Every subsequent proof of this result requires                   recurrence formulas of exceptional complexity in which the best                 value of the parameter is all but impossible to estimate.  A new                approach to the problem has recently been uncovered which                       provides good results in the linear setting.  Work to be done                   will now focus on nonlinear equations and singular perturbations                of regular equations in which the coefficient estimates are                     expected to be sharp.",
