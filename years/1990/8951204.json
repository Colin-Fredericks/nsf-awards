 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will integrate the use of modern microcomputer system              development tools into the undergraduate computer engineering                   curriculum.  The equipment, which is to be placed in the microcomputer          project laboratory, includes six IRM PC/AT-compatible personal                  computers, each equipped with computer-aided logic design and                   simulation software, programmable logic device development capability,          and modern cross-development software which will allow students to use          a high-level language (C) along with assembly language to develop               software for laboratory projects.  Six logic analyzers will also be             added to the laboratory.  These modern development tools are used               extensively in the high-technology industry and government laboratories         which are the primary employers of Wright State University's computer           engineering graduates.  Their integration into the computer engineering         laboratory program will significantly enhance the value of WSU's                program to the  community and better prepare computer engineering               graduates to be immediately productive in the jobs which they will              enter upon graduation.  The end result will be to promote the use of            modern development tools in those companies which are not already using         them, and to increase their effectiveness where they are already using          them, and to increase their effectiveness where they are already being          employed.",
