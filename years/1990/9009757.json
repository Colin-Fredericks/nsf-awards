 "awd_abstract_narration": "With networks and storage devices beginning to offer very                  high capacities, distributed systems can support communication                  and file services in the digital video and audio domains.  The                  project investigates paradigms and protocols for multi-media                    services that support visual/voice conversations and allow                      selective storage/retrieval of parts of a converstation.                        Conferencing is used as the basic paradigm for accessing any                    multi-media service.  For instance, to retrieve digital video a                 client establishes a conversation with the video file service; to               record parts of a conversation, the file service joins as a party               to the conversation transforming it into a conference; for                      entertainment during idle periods, a client joins a background                  conference with the HDTV service.  The project is developing                    precise models and connection management mechanisms for a                       powerful multi-level multi-channel conferencing paradigm.                            The project uses conversational file systems for storage/                  retrieval of multi-media data.  The file systems handle gigabyte                file sizes and handle inter-media synchronization.  Multi-media                 communication requires protocols that provide performance                       guarantees, and support multiple media streams while preserving                 temporal relationships among the streams.  The project                          investigates the design of such protocols and algorithms for                    allocation of resources to performance guaranteed channels.  The                outcome of the research is software architectures, protocols, and               algorithms that will enable multi-media computing systems to                    replace real-world services such as physical mail, telephony,                   news, advertising and video/audio entertainment.",
