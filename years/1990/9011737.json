 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to study the effect                   of ambient pressure on the ignition delay time and the burning                  time of boron agglomerates.  In this investigation a probe-                     supported boron agglomerate mounted inside a high-pressure                      combustion chamber is ignited by a CO2 laser beam.  The use of                  the laser ignition technique and high-pressure combustion                       chamber will permit the variation of the ambient pressure and                   oxidant mole fraction.  Surface temperature measurements of                     the laser-ignited boron agglomerate during the ignition and                     combustion events will be carried out using a near-infrared,                    two-color pyrometer.  In conjunction with the two-color                         pyrometer, a broadband radiometer is used to record the                         radiation emitted by the boron agglomerate.  From the temporal                  outputs of the two-color pyrometer and the broadband                            radiometer, it is possible to determine the ignition                            temperature, the preignition delay time and the burning time                    of the boron agglomerate as function of ambient pressure and                    oxidant mole fraction.                                                                                                                                          Boron slurries have a significant advantage over conventional                   jet fuels when evaluated on an energy-density basis.  This                      project will provide experimental determination of boron                        particle agglomerate burning rates in the operating pressure                    range of one to 20 atm, typical of high-performance air-                        breathing engines.",
