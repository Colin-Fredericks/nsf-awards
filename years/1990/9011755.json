 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have recently discovered and characterized a gene encoding a new             plant structural protein (ptGRP1) whose predicted amino acid                    composition contains 67% glycine.  ptGRP1 was the fourth class of               structural protein to be identified in plants.  The predicted                   protein structure and immunochemical studies indicated that the                 ptGRP1 protein product functions as a cell wall structural protein.                                                                                             This gene, on both the transcriptional and gene product levels, is              developmentally regulated and shows increased expression after                  wounding.  This proposal proposes to determine immunocytochemically             the exact cell specificity of this gene in all organs and the                   temporal pattern of ptGRP1 deposition in each of these cell types               during development.  In addition experiments to phenotypically                  characterized the effects of over-and under-expression of the                   ptGRP1 gene are proposed.  This study should provide information                which will help to determine the function of this gene and the                  contribution it makes to the development and morphology of the                  plant as a whole.",
