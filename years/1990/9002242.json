 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue his                    analytical studies of free boundary problems using asymptotic                   methods and he will initiate attempts to construct efficient                    numerical schemes for the resolution of interfacial phenomena.                  Overall he plans to develop a unified theory of free boundary                   problems that arise in phase transitions based upon the Phase                   Field Model that he himself has helped to popularize.  The                      principal investigator will consider progressively realistic                    models of alloys and contact with external containers.                          Many technologically important natural phenomena involve the                    behavior of different media along the interfaces or surfaces of                 contact between them.  With this award the principal investigator               will continue his important work on developing approximate                      solutions of models of phase transitions using asymptotic methods               and he will begin developing numerical schemes in order to                      resolve increasingly complicated interfacial phenomena.  This                   combined asymptotic-numerical approach should pay big dividends                 toward understanding the physics of transition layers and free                  boundary problems.",
