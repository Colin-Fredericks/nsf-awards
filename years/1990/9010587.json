 "awd_abstract_narration": "The full potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the               field of engineering has not been realized.  A growing source of                spatial and non-spatial information may be found organized in GIS               databases.  These systems have the potential for storing time                   dependent geographic information.  Effectively integration GIS                  databases with engineering applications involving planning,                     management, construction, analysis and design to create powerful                decision support tools would be of enormous benefit.                                                                                                            This research will identify and specify the GIS queries and object-             oriented (OO) data structure required to model and simulate                     physical and geographical processes and systems which are functions             of time and geographic location.  The object-oriented database                  model will be capable of representing spatial and non-spatial                   geographical data including geometric, material and functional                  information.  By automatically accessing GIS databases, powerful                engineering decision support software which is consistent and                   accurate can be developed at less cost.  The results of this                    research will serve as a link between engineering software and                  geographic databases.  Engineering systems used, for example, to                model waste water management, management, shoreline erosion,                    wellhead protection or air pollution transport will have direct                 access to actual geographic information.  This results of this work             will enhance the functionality of GIS software for engineering                  applications..//",
