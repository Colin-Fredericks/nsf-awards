 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an ambitious investigation of behavioral                 theories of decision making with the goal of building a coherent                method for measurement of utility and value.  Previous studies of               expected utility have produced two results:  First, a variety of                significant and reliable violations of utility theory have been                 reported.  Second, several variations of the standard theory have               been proposed to account for these violations.  The proposed                    research is designed to begin the construction of a behaviorally-               based coherent framework.                                                                                                                                       A central idea behind the proposed research is the search for a                 common utility scale underlying behavior in a variety of tasks.                 The goal is to determine whether it is possible to provide a                    coherent system of utility equations to describe behavioral                     decision making.  Procedures developed by the principal                         investigator in other domains will be applied to develop a                      framework for the research.  The proposed approach has the                      potential to account for a wide range of phenomena and to resolve               several controviersies in the literature.  Even if the proposed                 effort does not work out, the experiments will yield interesting                new findings which will enhance understanding of risky decisions.               In all, the potential return from this project is substantial.",
