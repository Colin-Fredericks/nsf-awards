 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for               Undergraduate site in southeast Wisconsin.  Eight highly qualified              undergraduates will be recruited to conduct research, at the                    Biomedical Research Institute laboratories on the campus of the                 University of Wisconsin-Parkside in Kenosha.  Based upon extensive              experiences with undergraduate research together with active                    research programs, faculty representing the focus of Molecular and              Regulatory Biology will serve as potential project supervisors.                 This program is designed to develop each participant's intellectual             confidence, technical competence and research independence via:                                                                                                 1.  Guidance by active researchers in the areas of Molecular and                    Regulatory Biology.                                                         2.  A program of specific goals for each student's research                         progress via a meeting and seminar schedule plus instruction                    in literature search and seminar presentation techniques                        complementary to each project.                                              3.  Amplification of the NSF effort through a commitment to carry                   over meritorious students for a second summer of research using                 internal funding and/or to support additional students each                     summer.                                                                     4.  Aggressive regional recruitment of superior candidates with                     special efforts to attract underrepresented groups plus housing                 arrangements proximate to the UW-P laboratories, and,                       5.  Immediate and long-term evaluation of the NSF-REU experience.",
