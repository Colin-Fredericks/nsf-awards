 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project has been the revision of the first                  year chemistry laboratory curriculum at the college to include                  new and revised experiments which make use of microcomputers to                 record and process experimental data.  The equipment which was                  acquired includes 10 computer data acquisition and processing                   workstations, and an Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometer               with data analysis computer and spectral analysis software.  The                data acquisition workstations are being used in experiments                     involving pH and potentiometric titrations, chemical kinetics,                  and thermochemistry.  The infrared spectrophotometer and                        dedicated computer is being used to analyze the reactants and                   products of organic reactions which are being introduced into the               first year curriculum which more realistically represents modern                chemical laboratory work, and therefore better educates science                 and engineering students in the principles and practices of                     modern chemistry.                                                                                                                                               The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
