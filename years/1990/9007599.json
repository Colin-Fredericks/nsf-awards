 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical research on problems involving the application                of harmonic analysis to partial differential equations will be                  carried out under this award.  The work falls into three groups,                the first of which concerns the Zygmund conjecture on multiple                  parameter families of rectangles.  It was long believed that the                k-parameter maximal function should have boundedness properties                 depending only on the parameter k and not on the dimension of                   the underlying space.  That this was not necessarily the case                   was shown by F. Soria in 1986.  Since this maximal function is                  central to any multi-dimensional differentiation theory, it is                  still of interest to find what the correct formulation of the                   bound on the maximal function should be.                                             A second line of investigation concerns product singular                   integrals, a theory which developed from the one-variable theory                only after the investment of considerable effort (the natural                   one-dimensional generalizations failed to carry over).  Work is                 now progressing on the goal of showing that singular integrals                  can be expressed as pointwise limits of multiply truncated                      singular integrals.                                                                  Finally, work in partial differential equations will                       concentrate on elliptic equations defined in a ball in Euclidean                space.  If the coefficients of the elliptic part of the operator                are bounded and measurable, and the boundary values are required                to be in one of the Lebesgue spaces, there are (somewhat                        surprisingly) cases where the equation has no solution.  The                    question of existence has attracted the attention of many                       mathematicians over the past decade.  What is now evolving are                  methods of determining existence in terms of the proximity of the               operator to other operators for which the Dirichlet problem can                 be solved.  This work will continue along the same line except                  that the domain under consideration will be unbounded.                          Significant differences arise in this setting, even for elliptic                operators with smooth coefficients.",
