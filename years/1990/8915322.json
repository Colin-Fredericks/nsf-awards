 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the continued study of the use of                   random iterated function systems (IFS) to generate and encode                   digital images.  In IFS generation an ergodic Markov chain is                   simulated in R2 or R3 through products of random affine                         transformations, and its trajectory is plotted to create an                     image.  The IFS encoding problem involves the construction of                   such a Markov chain so as to generate a given target image.  By                 exploiting the linearity of the transformations involved with                   these chains, one can encode any digital image, and for a broad                 class of images this affords substantial data compression.  It is               planned to analyze and test various encoding schemes, and to                    develop algorithms to implement them on vector and parallel                     machines.                                                                            It is potentially of great value to deal with large-scale                  image and encoding problems, particularly involving real time                   applications of image transmission and communication, image                     construction and processing and image restoration.  Potential                   applications include 3-D mechanical imaging, visual (e.g.,                      flight) simulators, voice and pattern recognition, optical                      character and object scanners, image understanding, fingerprint                 and passport encoding, animation encoding, high resolution                      graphics and high definition TV.",
