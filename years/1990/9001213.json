 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taste is a very important sense because it is involved in food                  selection and preference, and related to hunger, ingestion, and                 nutritional aspects of behavior.  Most studies of taste have                    involved rodents, which have aspects of physiology and behavior                 very different from humans, and there are few data on gustatory                 processing to compare human sensory capabilities with rodent                    physiology.  This study utilizes a novel approach of chronic                    recording from a behaving animal to explore how activity in the                 cortex of a primate brain correlates to behavior.  Response                     characteristics and functional organization of the cortex will                  be explored, to determine how well data from human                              psychophysical studies are matched by electrophysiological                      data.  This novel approach will provide data important for                      chemosensory science, for comparing functional organization of                  gustatory cortex with other sensory cortical areas, and for                     further understanding how brain activity underlies perception                   and behavior.",
