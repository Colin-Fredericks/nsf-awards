 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer and related                    sampling accessories were acquired through this project in order                to implement an instructional project which has yielded \"across                 the board\" improvements in undergraduate chemistry instruction at               the institution.  This project involved the design and                          implementation of experiments utilizing the FTIR and its data                   station for both upper and lower level courses.  The work                       enhanced the quality of undergraduate instruction in three way,                 namely by (1) serving as a vehicle for teaching advanced                        instrumental concepts such as analog-digital relations and                      software data manipulation, (2) providing students hands-on                     experience with a modern, computerized instrument commonly                      encountered in academic and industrial postgraduate settings, and               (3) motivating underclassmen to purse chemistry as their major                  field of study by exposing them to the \"state of the art\" in                    infrared analysis.                                                                                                                                              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
