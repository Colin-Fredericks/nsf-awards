 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation will investigate information-seeking behavior                 by newcomers to organizations.  Five primary tasks must be                      accomplished before a newcomer can become an insider--task                      mastery, role clarification, acculturation, and social                          integration.  Information is essential for accomplishing these                  tasks.  It is argued that newcomers who initiate the exchange of                information will adjust more rapidly and more effectively than                  those who passively wait for information to be delivered.  In                   this study, 250 newly hired auditors in five large accounting                   firms will complete written surveys assessing information                       seeking and various facets of socialization at three time                       points.  The results will contribute to understanding the                       newcomer in socialization processes.  Socialization research has                traditionally focused on organizational activities, and                         newcomers have been portryed as fairly passive recipients of                    organizations' influence.  This dissertation will make an                       important theoretical contribution by focusing on the role of                   information, and information transmission, in the socialization                 process.  Further, it will enhance our understanding of                         information seeking, particularly the different forms of seeking                and the implications that this activity has for the seeker.",
