 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on optimal control of multiple robots,                     specifically, on the most rapid way to perform pick and place                   operations with two link robot arms, where the actuators have                   bounded torques.  Most research on two arm systems has addressed                the development of the equations of motion, or control schemes                  based on position control to a given path.  This work looks at                  control optimization.  The configuration assumed for this work                  comprises a two arm manipulator with fixed base, bounded torques                at both shoulder and elbow, forces only and no moment applied to                payload, and rigid links and payload.  Initial work has been                    directed at the case for small payload motions, where the payload               starts and finishes with zero linear and angular velocity, and                  the optimization problem was to minimize travel time from the                   initial to final position.  In the current study, large payload                 motions are studied, and several cases are investigated including               (1) specified initial and final position, (2) open initial                      conditions, (3) constraints on the internal force in the payload,               (4) payload held by friction as opposed to being pinned to the                  manipulator, and (5) moving base.  The research impact will be on               the increased efficiency of robotic systems.",
