 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support graduate students, postdoctoral                  fellows and visiting scientists who are all working with faculty                members at Carnegie-Mellon University on various problems in the                nonlinear theory of continuum mechanics.  The principal goal is                 to train the next generation of workers in the mathematical                     aspects of materials science by providing them access to the                    expertise and guidance of applied mathematicians and materials                  scientists who are at the forefront of the application of                       advanced analytical and numerical methods to problems involving                 phase transitions and microstructure.                                           As an illustration of the research to be undertaken in this grant               consider the problem of how to grow crystals as free as possible                from defects.  The solution of such a complicated problem                       requires the cooperation of mathematicians and materials                        scientists who are able to solve effectively mathematical models                of crystal growth and then use those solutions to design better                 manufacturing processes.  It is a truly synergistic relationship                since the mathematicians need the physical expertise of the                     materials people and the materials scientists need the                          mathematicians to solve the models.  Thus there is a real need to               train young scientists in this cross-disciplinary field by                      allowing them to work with the best people in both applied                      mathematics and materials science.",
