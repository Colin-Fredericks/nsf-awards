 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze household                 data from manuscript schedules of the census for one state in the               Northeast (Massachusetts) and one state in the Midwest (Ohio).                  These households will be matched with tax lists in the                          corresponding census years to obtain assessed values of real and                personal property.  The resulting data will create a time-series                on inequality and on age patterns of wealth ownership from 1820                 to 1910.  Because similar data are available for other states,                  the approach could be extended to other states and regions in the               country.  The matched records will be used to study the                         determinants of wealth and to address questions on the course of                inequality during industrialization, the evolution of life-cycle                patterns of wealth accumulation, the economic achievements by                   occupation, the economic performance of ethnic minorities and                   women, and sources and implications of regional differences in                  inequality.  The data collected will also shed light on theories                of industrialization and give historical perspective to the                     modern debate over economic mobility and the cycle of poverty.",
