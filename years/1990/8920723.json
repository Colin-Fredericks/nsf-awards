Phase I                      research, conducted under NSF Grant No. 88-60246, was                           successful in separating paper mill sludges into long                           fiber, short fiber, clay and debris fractions.  The long                        fiber fraction was determined to be of comparable quality                       to that used in paper making and the recovered clay was                         determined to be susceptible to improvement of brightness                       which would make it more acceptable for reuse.  In Phase                        II, the investigators plan to examine the process                               developed in Phase I at a sufficiently large scale to                           provide the basis for its engineering design and                                installation in a full-scale paper making plant.  Work                          will include improving the brightness of the clay fraction                      by bleaching and other chemical processes and                                   determination of the physical properties of the clay                            fraction.                                                                                                                                                       Results of this research project are expected to be                             utilized in engineering design of processes and systems                         for recovery of a large fraction of the wood fibers and                         clays now used in making paper that are discarded and                           placed in landfills.  In addition to the economic benefits                      of reusing presently discarded waste materials, recovery                        of the resource values from paper-making sludges will                           reduce the volume that must now be provided for their                           storage.",
