 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Equipment Grant will enable acquisition of a Macintosh            IIci computer and the program Mathematica as essential aides in the             Principal Investigator's research activities.  The research projects            encompass diverse topics which share two common attributes:  the                collective motion of charged particles, chiefly in plasmas, and                 nonlinear processes.  The research is theoretical with a mixture of             analytical and numerical approaches where symbolic computation will be          increasingly important in the analytical portions.  The investigation           of ion beams, used in neutral beam heating and sputtering, attempts to          derive analytical expressions for the ion distribution functions, the           electric fields, potentials, etc. with a model for the measured beam            density as the starting point.  Finding more realistic and stable               distribution functions is possible.  Analytical expressions for the             carrier speed in collisional semiconductors are useful in the                   investigation of possible spatially periodic space charge and device            applications.  The research of the nonlinear Vlasov-Maxwell equations           on integrable systems will become an investigation of the boundaries            of chaotic behavior for time-dependent electric fields.  Chaotic                solutions may exist for the carrier speed in semiconductors also.  In           all projects nonlinear solutions found by using Lie group symmetries            of differential equations have given results either not known before            or found much more efficiently.",
