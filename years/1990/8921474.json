 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study involves a comparative analysis of intermarriage                     patterns of the six largest Asian-origin groups in the                          continental United States: Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese,                        Koreans, Asian Indians, and Vietnamese.  The Principal                          Investigators will draw on data from the 1980 5% Public Use                     Microdata Sample of the U.S. Census (PUMS) to examine the                       tendency of individuals to marry a member of the same ethnic                    group or someone from a different ethnic group.   Previous                      research on the intermarriage of Asians in the United States has                been limited by geographical and/or group constraints.  These                   researchers will rectify this situation by conducting a                         comparative analysis of the extent and determinants of Asian                    intermarriage.  They will integrate two theoretical perspectives                on intermarriage.  The first, the assimilation model, assumes                   that people make marital decisions according to their cultural                  preferences and factors such as citizenship, ability with                       English, and socioeconomic attainment.  The second, the                         structural model, suggests that marital decisions are                           constrained by the structural and demographic reality of the                    society in which they live, including such factors as the                       relative group size and racial and educational heterogenity.                    Combining these two perspectives provides a more realistic model                of the actual dynamics of the intermarriage process in general,                 and for America's fastest growing ethnic minority -- Asian                      Americans.  This is the first effort to provide a systematic                    analysis of Asian intermarriage encompassing the entire                         continental United States, and will advance current knowledge on                the assimilation process of this important subgroup of the                      population.  As such, this study will contribute to models of                   intermarriage that recognize sociocultural and socioeconomic                    diversity.",
