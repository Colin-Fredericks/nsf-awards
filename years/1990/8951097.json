 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this project is to introduce research                       expertise to undergraduates through a design/research laboratory                course.  The design/research laboratory in which a broad-based,                 hands-on approach is taken enables the students to teach                        themselves either traditional or fiber optics systems,                          optoelectronics and Gaussian beams, or lasers and quantum                       electronics.  The intention is to motivate students to continue in              this new technology focussing on topics that intrigue them.  A                  prototype with a minimum of equipment is currently in operation.                Equipment to develop  a full-scale laboratory from this prototype               is provided.  This development would double the size of existing                facilities and student-handling capabilities.  The key feature of               the laboratory is the addition of an argon/dye laser and an                     optical multichannel analyzer which dramatically increases the                  substance of the experiments performed by the students.  By                     operating year round (2 semesters and summer) at full                           implementation, the new laboratory can accommodate 100 students.",
