 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal outlines a valuable extension of research on expected              utility theory.  Forty years of experience has led to two                       conclusions.  One, stressed by empirical researchers, is that the               theory does not adequately describe behavior in many experimental               and real-world situations.  The other, stressed by decision                     analysts, is that the axioms of the theory are normatively                      appealing and difficult to dismiss.  The gap between the                        descriptive inadequacy and normative appeal has widened in the past             ten years.  As a result, researchers have challenged not only the               descriptive validity, but the normative basis of expected utility               theory.                                                                         The proposed research begins by identifying a common ground for                 descriptive and normative research in a newly developed rank and                sign dependent (RSD) linear utility theory.  The investigators                  propose (1) to extend the range of concepts included in RSD, (2)                to test key assumptions of RSD, (3) to develop connections between              RSD and traditional utility theory, and (4) to explore the                      normative-descriptive distinction in the context of RSD.  Thus, the             research combines theoretical development, experimental research,               and applied experience in an effort to bridge the normative-                    descriptive gap in the theory of decision making under uncertainty.",
