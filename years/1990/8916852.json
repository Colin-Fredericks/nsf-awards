 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of the Seismic Experiment-Ross Ice                     Shelf (SERIS), a seismic study of the plate boundary                            between East Antarctica and the Ross Embayment.  The first                      year involves acquisition of a 150-km-long multichannel                         seismic reflection line starting on the Ross ice shelf and                      entering the Transantarctic Mountains front through one of                      the outlet glaciers.  A reversed refraction profile and                         several wide-angle reflection profiles will be collected                        along the multichannel seismic line.  Interpretation of the                     data, flexural modeling of the uplift and the subsidence,                       analysis of the seismic stratigraphy and modeling of                            gravity will be carried out in the second year.  This study                     is a joint project between scientists from Ohio State                           University, Stanford University, the U.S. Geological Survey                     at Menlo Park, and the Geophysics Division, Department of                       Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) in New Zealand.                       This award supports the establishment of a 12-element                           short-period digital seismic array to record reflection and                     refraction shots to determine the Antarctic crustal                             thickness of a central inland portion of the Transantarctic                     Mountains.  The experiment is designed to serve as a                            prototype for large-scale seismic experiments in the                            interior of Antarctica in the next decade.",
