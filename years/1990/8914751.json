 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in science education                   to be carried out by Sally Duensing of the Exploratorium in                     San Francisco and Maurice Bazin, Director of Espaco Ciencia                     Viva (Living Science Space) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The                     focus of this research will be the investigation of significant                 cross-cultural issues in informal science education, both for                   the general public and specifically in working with elementary                  and middle-school teachers.  The work will begin with a                         comparison of the ways exhibits are used as adjunctive                          teaching materials by museums in different cultural settings.                   Because of their work with poor communities in Rio, Espaco                      Ciencia Viva focuses on more socially relevant issues in                        exhibits and programs.  This can have a powerful effect on                      the differences involved in the communication of science to                     different cultural groups, a currently vital need in the U.S.                   as well as in other countries particularly in a time of                         global concerns about scientific issues.  Then, there is the                    question of how access to modern technology affects the                         understanding of science and scientific issues and thus                         affects approaches to teaching.                                                                                                                                 The museums will exchange staff who are actively involved in                    the creation of exhibits and educational materials and also                     in teacher education programs.  The visits will be scheduled                    when teaching programs are under way.  Participation in these                   programs will provide the basis for sharing ideas and for                       making the cross-cultural observations of the differences in                    teaching science to students and to teachers of very different                  background levels.  Because both institutions have some                         exhibits in common, the visiting staff will study how                           teachers use exhibits with similar overall content and                          function in different contexts.  Clearly, each institution                      will derive new ideas from the other in areas of materials                      development, science education, teacher training and public                     awareness of science.",
