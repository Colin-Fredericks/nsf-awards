 "awd_abstract_narration": "Movement by animals including man, requires precise timing                 to be smooth and coordinated.  The neurons which control movement               have been in existence for millions of years and if we can                      understand how they work we will have fundamental knowledge for                 understanding numerous aspects of movement from designing robots                to rehabilitating stroke victims.  The proposed study will focus                on one of the oldest vertebrates known . the lamprey.  Its                      nervous system has to provide accurate wave motions through                     pattern generating nerves which can be recorded in vitro.  Also                 the lamprey undergoes a protracted larval phase during which the                pace maker neurons must change cell firing rates to maintain the                exact phase of the rhythm even though the neurons are growing                   longer and thereby taking longer to fire the muscle.  The study                 will provide both basic biological data of the cell firing                      patterns during fictive swimming and also a mathematical analysis               of the stable and unstable patterns and phase shifts.  The work                 should tell us much about very basic events in the control of                   movement.",
