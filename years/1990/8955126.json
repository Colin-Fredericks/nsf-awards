 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project brings together three components:                         (a) summer workshops, (b) an equipment library and                              (c) mobile units during the academic year.  Beginning in the                    summer of 1990 and continuing in 1991, eight day                                laboratory/demontration workshop courses for physics and                        physical science teachers will be held at the University of                     New Orleans.  These will be complemented by a one credit hour                   in-service course during the fall and spring.  In addition                      the ongoing activities of the Metro Orleans Physics Teacher                     Organization will serve as a mutual support group.  These                       workshops will provide these opportunities for 28 teacher                       each year.                                                                                                                                                      During the school year two physics resource teachers trained                    by the American Association of Physics Teachers in the PTRA                     program will provide in-classroom support to teachers of                        physics and physical science in an area within a thirty-five                    mile radius of New Orleans.  The resource teachers will                         operate from mobile van units containing necessary materials                    and equipment for their scheduled visits.  These mobile units                   will in turn be stocked from an equipment library holding                       materials appropriate for courses in physics and physical                       science at the secondary level.  Material not needed for the                    mobile units will be available for borrowing by science                         teachers in the area.                                                                                                                                           The project brings together federal, state and local                            resources to promote hands-on science teaching in an urban                      area with substantial minority components among the science                     teachers and in the student population.  Local support                          requires the cooperative efforts of business, several public                    and private school systems and the University of New Orleans.                                                                                                   Cost sharing in an amount of $237,437 equals 111% of the NSF                    award.",
