 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with problems in algebraic                      geometry. The principal investigator will continue his study of                 motivic cohomology and establishing connections with algebraic                  K-theory and the values of Dedekind zeta functions. There are                   possible applications to the Soule-Beilinson conjecture and                     related topics which will also be explored.                                          This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one                   of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has                    had a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In                   its origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the                    plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays                   the field makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from                  analysis and topology, and conversely is finding application in                 those fields as well as in theoretical computer science and                     robotics.",
