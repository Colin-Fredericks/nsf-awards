 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to address emerging issues of global change            (i.e. greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, deforestation, water                  pollution, loss of biological diversity, etc.) and the impact these             changes may have on humans.  The project will also relate these issues          to the processes and concepts of the science taught in secondary                schools.  Development of five or more multi-activity modules, sequenced         into an instructional unit, will be developed for high school biology,          chemistry, and physics classes.  A parallel version for use in junior           high will also be developed.  The modules will include (a) the nature of        the research and resulting data that has led to an understanding of the         issues, and (b) an emphasis on the implications of the topics for               domestic and world social, political and economic issues.  Research data        and background understandings for the module developers will be provided        by the active involvement of scientists from the Byrd Polar Research            Center and the Center for Mapping at the Ohio State University.                 Classroom ideas for use with the research topics will be generated by           teachers and developed into modules by the project staff.  Continued            input and monitoring by the research scientists will assure accuracy in         representing both the subject matter and the methods of science.                Similar involvement by teachers and science educators, with formative           pilot testing, revision, and summative evaluation, will assure that             pedagogy is sound and materials workable in classroom settings.                 Creative use of instructional methodologies such as simulations and             laboratory exercises will be accompanied by adaptations of remote               imaging, geographic information systems, and other data gathering and           analysis techniques.  Finally, the project will develop a model teacher         workshop for dissemination of the materials through the National Science        Teacher Association (NSTA) conferences and will meet NSTA requirements          for distribution through that association.",
