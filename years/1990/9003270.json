 "awd_abstract_narration": "The third annual \"Mouse Molecular Genetics\" meeting is scheduled                to be held in Cold Spring Harbor, August 29 to September 2 and is               expected to attract about 350 scientists working on various aspects             of the molecular biology and molecular genetics of the mouse.  The              emphasis of the meeting will be on the mouse as an organism (as                 opposed to in vitro studies) and will cover such areas as:                      regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation and oncogenesis,              models of disease processes embryonic stem cells, and molecular                 analysis of mutations.  In the past, sessions on germ cells and the             development of hemopoietic system were arranged based upon the                  number of interesting abstracts submitted in these areas.  We hope              to have enough interest in neurobiology to have a separate session              this year.  The use of homologous recombination to disrupt specific             genes has been featured in previous meetings and this year should               reveal the fruits of this powerful technique as applied to various              interesting genes in the mouse.  The meeting is intended for                    students and post docs as well as established investigators.  All               applicants will be expected to submit an abstract- about a third                will be selected for 10 minute talks along with the invited                     speakers and the rest will present posters. The abstracts will be               collated into a booklet that will be available to all attendees but             proceedings will not be published.  This has been a very successful             meeting the last two years and feel that it still fills an                      important niche by allowing cross communication between various                 disciplines.",
