 "awd_abstract_narration": "In skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) a 106 kDa calcium                release channel protein has been identified and purified through                its \"critical\" free sulfhydryl by covalently linking it to biotin               via a disulfide bond and using biotin-avidin chromatography.                    Upon incorporation in planar bilayers, this protein exhibited the               properties of a calcium channel similar to those reported for the               400 kDa \"feet\" proteins.  Immunological analysis using polyclonal               antibodies against the 106 kDa and monoclonals against calcium-                 magnesium ATPase showed that the 106 kDa is distinct from SR                    calcium pumps and is neither a subunit nor a proteolytic fragment               of the 400 kDa.  The 106 kDa channels have been successfully                    purified by a) linear sucrose gradients, b) biotin avidin-, c)                  ryanodine, and d) immuno-affinity chromatography.  The goals of                 the project are 1) To incorporate the purified 106 kDa calcium                  release channel protein into planar bilayers to characterize in                 detail the single channel ionic conductances, sub-states,                       selectivities and its modulation by agents that alter SR calcium                release.  The results will be compared with those reported for                  the 400 kDa \"feet\" protein.  2) To raise monoclonal antibodies                  against the 106 kDa channel and test them for possible modulation               of calcium release in SR vesicles.  3) To localize this channel                 in junctional SR and rabbit psoas fibers by immuno-cytochemistry.               4) To re-examine the purification of the 400 kDa protein by                     linear sucrose gradients since the 106 kDa protein often co-                    migrates with the 400 kDa, and to use immuno-affinity columns to                separate the 106 from the 400 kDa proteins.  5) Ryanodine-                      affinity columns have been made by 2 methods.  Both columns bind                selectively to the 106 kDa channel, implying that this channel                  has important physiological significance.  The affinity and                     stoichiometry of tritiated ryanodine binding to 106 kDa will be                 measured and compared with binding data with junctional SR and                  the purified 400 kDa protein.  6) To determine the relationship                 and possible interaction of the 106 kDa channel with other SR                   proteins (i.e., the 400 kDa \"feet\" proteins) by covalently cross-               linking the 106 kDa with neighboring junctional SR proteins using               bi-functional cross-lining reagents of various spacer arm                       lengths.                                                                                                                                                        Recent progress in the understanding of excitation-contraction                  coupling has led to the general acceptance of the idea that the                 channel through which calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic                 reticulum is a 400 kDa protein which corresponds to structural                  \"feet\" seen in the electron microscope.  Dr. Salama has                         accumulated substantial evidence, however, that a second, much                  smaller (106 kDa) protein may be the calcium release channel.                   The proposed experiments will characterize the smaller protein                  and elucidate its relationship to the \"feet\" protein.  The                      results of this research should clarify the identity of the                     protein molecules responsible for calcium release from the                      sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitation-contraction coupling in                    striated muscle.  ***//",
