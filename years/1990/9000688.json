The award                       continues an earlier program of research in applied and discrete                mathematics, matroid theory and mathematical modeling.  Students                will work in small teams under faculty advisors.  Written reports               at the end of the program are required.  Where possible, students               will be encouraged to rewrite the reports for publication and                   presentation at professional meetings.                                               Research projects include studies on birigid graphs in the                 plane and their excess (the number of edges which can be                        discarded without destroying rigidity).  The problem to be taken                up concerns the existence of minimal birigid graphs with                        arbitrary excess.  Combinatorial characterizations of birigid                   graphs in higher dimensions will also considered.  Work will be                 done on bifurcation problems in autocatalytic chemical reactions.               These reactions are prime examples of nonlinear systems whose                   modeling (reaction diffusion equations) are not well understood.                The objective of this project will be to determine the symmetry                 properties of the system, the bifurcation diagram and the                       properties of its solutions.  Symbolic and numerical computations               are expected to play an important role in much of the research to               be done.",
