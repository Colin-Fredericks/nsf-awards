 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have been undertaken at sites scattered throughout          the world to analyze pollen and sediments in cores from bogs, lakes,            and other appropriate settings.  These analyses have shed considerable          light on changing patterns of vegetation and climate over the last              10,000 and more years.  One area that has not been intensively studied,         however, is the humid, subtropical region of southeastern China.  This          doctoral dissertation project will extract and analyze cores from bogs          in the Wuyi and Daiyun mountains of Fujian Province.  Radiocarbon               dating will help establish the ages of pollen and sediments within the          cores, and related analyses will help reconstruct vegetational and              climatic patterns in the region.                                                     This project will provide valuable information for reconstructing          the natural environmental history of southeastern China.  This                  reconstruction will be especially useful because it will help assess            the impacts of changing conditions on monsoon circulation, which is             such an important facet of the region's climate.   This project also            will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to          continue to develop independent research skills.",
