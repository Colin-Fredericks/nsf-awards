 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Zoology at Arizona               State University to purchase equipment which will help give                     freshman/sophomore-level, non-major students a laboratory                       experience involving scientific inquiry, critical thinking and                  evaluation skills, and student discovery using non-invasive human               physiology experiments as a vehicle.  The laboratory will use                   research-grade analogue recording equipment and transducers as well             as computer-matched data acquisition equipment, and computer-based              statistical and graphic data analysis software.  The analogue                   equipment will be used for student-designed experiments while the               computer-based transducers will be used for more organized                      laboratory exercises.  Throughout the laboratory, emphasis will be              placed on development of critical analysis of data, and an increase             in general and specific scientific literacy rather than the                     \"canned\" experiment-memorization driven laboratory experiences                  typical of human physiology courses.  In addition, the laboratory               experience will be designed to give a specific introduction to                  human body function to include areas of current interest and of                 current misconception among college-age students.",
