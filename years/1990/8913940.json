 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does government regulate the flow of international commerce?                Standard models explain American trade policy as the result of                  either politically influential pressure groups demanding                        protection, or as the result of elected officials and bureaucrats               supplying protection.  These models provide only part of the                    picture.  Conventional models, for example, cannot explain such                 diverse policy outcomes as long term quotas to protect sugar                    (1934), dairy products (1953), meat (1965), and petroleum                       (1959-73); nor can they explain shifts in negotiating authority                 away from the president and to the USTR in the 1988 Omnibus                     Trade Bill.                                                                                                                                                     In this Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project, the                     argument is presented that, contrary to the standard view,                      members of Congress in passing trade legislation face a problem                 of how to organize for collective action.  Congress solves its                  internal decision making problems by delegating authority to a                  central agent (namely, the president), and by establishing an                   elaborate pre-negotiating advisory system with congressional                    vetos to constrain presidential action.  The central hypothesis -                - Congress imposes structure and process to ensure that policy                 decisions made by the executive are satisfactory to its members -                - is based on the premise that members of Congress are motivated               by an electoral incentive, that they adopt procedural                           arrangements to help win reelection, and that changes in                        procedural arrangements yield predictable changes in policy                     outcomes.                                                                                                                                                       The general conclusion is that while members of Congress have                   delegated authority to the president to enter into international                trade agreements, they have simultaneously introduced procedural                arrangements which constrain the substantive authority the                      president can exercise. This is independent of congressional                    approval and provisions for constituents injured by import                      competition opportunities for exemption, compensation, or delay.                The importance of this analysis is that by identifying the                      process through which international trade policy is made, we are                better able to specify the conditions that facilitate the                       maintenance of a relatively open trading system in the face of                  rising demands for import protection.",
