 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Young Investigator will conduct research in               the area of computational fluid dynamics;  in particular, he will               study shock diffractions and bifurcations as different shocks                   interact with each other and with fluid interfaces and vortex                   sheets.  This is very important and timely research, and it is of               sufficient complexity that the PI will employ analytical methods                from geometry and bifurcation theory, in addition to                            computational techniques.  The goals of the research are twofold.               The first goal is to discover different types of wave patterns                  that result from the complex interactions of shocks and fluid                   structures, while the second goal is to develop numerical methods               that allow one to follow the evolution in time of the waves                     generated by the interactions.                                                       Many phenomena in fluid dynamics arise out of the                          interactions of different types of waves with each other and with               internal fluid structures such as interfaces.  What makes these                 interactions difficult to study mathematically is that they are                 described by systems of nonlinear differential equations, and so                one must use computers in order to generate solutions.  But this                is tricky also, because computers can often generate meaningless                information, unless the numerical methods used are reliable.  The               PI will study such problems with \"intelligent\" numerical methods.               These are methods that have sufficient analytical and physical                  theory built into them that they produce sharp approximations to                the correct physical solutions.",
