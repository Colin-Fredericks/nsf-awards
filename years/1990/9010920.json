 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply case-based reasoning techniques to the                 construction of intelligent tutoring systems for diagnostic                     problem solving.  It is believed that when a tutoring system's                  expertise and curriculum are anchored in the same set of cases,                 the tutor will be better able to select appropriate training                    cases, to assess student performance on these cases, and to                     remediate when errors are detected.  This work will build on the                foundation of the Protos automated knowledge acquisition system.                Complete tutoring systems will be developed in at least two                     domains.  Evaluation studies will compare the tutor's                           effectiveness to that of classroom instruction.  Evaluation in                  multiple domains will permit cross-domain comparison to separate                general results from domain idiosyncrasies.  The project will                   contribute to three areas of intelligent tutoring research.                     First, it will address the modeling of expert and student                       knowledge in \"weak-theory\" domains.  Second, it will address the                diagnosis and remediation of student errors.  Third, it will                    address curriculum generation and sequencing.  In the long term,                synthesis of the lessons learned from research in intelligent                   tutoring systems, expert consultation systems, and automated                    knowledge acquisition will contribute to a deeper understanding                 of diagnostic expertise.",
