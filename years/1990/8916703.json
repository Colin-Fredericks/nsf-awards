 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ras proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding proteins which are                  central to cellular signal transduction.  Although the                          mechanism(s) of action of cellular and mutant forms of the ras                  protein p21 have not been fully described, microinjection of                    either form can cause Xenopus oocytes to undergo meiotic cell                   division.  Since ras protein has been found to increase                         polyphosphatidylinositol turnover, ras may act through the                      intracellular messengers of this pathway, protein kinase C and                  inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3).  Since IP3 has been found to                release intracellular calcium in oocytes and other cell types,                  this suggests that at least some actions of ras may be due to                   increased intracellular calcium.  While other laboratories have                 concentrated on the protein kinase C pathway, this laboratory has               indirect evidence that ras protein can release intracellular                    calcium.  Experiments are proposed to establish directly whether                ras protein increases intracellular calcium and whether the                     cellular or mutant forms of ras induce two responses (meiotic                   cell division and an increase in intracellular pH) through the                  calcium increase.                                                                                                                                               The proposed research will examine the mechanism of action of a                 protein, the \"ras\" protein, that is important in signal                         transduction across the cell membrane.  Microinjection of ras                   proteins into frog eggs induces cell division.  A variety of                    evidence suggests that ras effects may involve changes in the                   level of intracellular free calcium.  This research will                        determine whether the ras protein itself releases calcium from                  intracellular stores or affects intracellular calcium levels                    less directly.  The results will contribute to a better                         understanding of the mechanisms of cellular signal transduction.",
