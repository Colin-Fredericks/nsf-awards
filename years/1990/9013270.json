 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal for a two-year study of the feeding                     ecology and positional behavior of lowland gorillas (Gorilla                    gorilla gorilla) at the Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the Central                    African Republic.  The work follows a three month pilot study                   which assessed the feasibility of this study.  The objectives of                the study are to document the frequency of locomotor and postural               behavior in the context of feeding and other activities, and to                 do an intraspecific comparison of the effects of body size                      dimorphism on the use of arboreal substrates to gain access to                  food.  Virtually all of our knowledge of gorilla behavior at this               time comes form extensive studies of a different subspecies, the                mountain gorilla which is almost completely terrestrial.  The                   preliminary pilot study of the lowland gorilla indicated that it                spends a great deal of time feeding in an arboreal context.  This               is unexpected in view of what anthropologists currently know                    about gorillas.  This study will help to elucidate geographic                   variation in gorilla ecology and behavior.  It will also provide                critical information for understanding the relationship between                 hominoid body size and locomotor behavior.",
