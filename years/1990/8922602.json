 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Geological Society of America is an important source of                funding for graduate student research in the earth sciences.                    Since the Society's research grants program began in 1933, awards               have been made to 4,336 geoscientists in the total amount of                    $4,796,544.  In 1989, the research grants budget was $180,600,                  comprising 210 awards averaging $860 per recipient.  This year's                budget allowed funding of only 43% of the requests, and at less                 than 80% of the awardees' proposed expenditures.                                In order to bring the supply of funds more into balance with                    demand, GSA is proposing to enter into a three-year, cooperative                financing program with the National Science Foundation,                         commencing in April 1991.  Under this proposal GSA (together with               its Foundation) and NSF would fund two-thirds and one-third                     respectively of a $300,000 annual student research grants budget.               GSA will administer the program, as it has for the past 56 years.               An NSF conferee has met with the Research Grants Committee                      during its deliberations each year, and such representation is                  proposed to continue during the term of this program.",
