 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Flora Novo-Galiciana is intended as an authoritative                   taxonomic guide to the flowering plants, ferns, and conifers of a               biologically rich portion of western Mexico.  It provides a                     working tool for identification of and research on the                          approximately 7500 species of plants in this region of Jalisco                  and surrounding areas, ranging from sea beaches and tropical                    evergreen forest to semi-arid grasslands and mountain peaks that                ascend to timberline and above.  All species are provided                       detailed morphological description, an illustration of technical                features, full references to literature in which the species have               been treated, brief discussion about habitats and geographical                  range, vernacular names, economic values and uses.  There is no                 complete such account of the plants of any other part of Mexico.                     Dr. Rogers McVaugh has been working on this inventory for                  over 40 years, amassing plant collections now deposited in                      herbaria in Mexico City and in several U.S. institutions.  Five                 volumes have been published thus far, treating the legumes, the                 orchids, the grasses, the sunflower family, and the bromeliads                  and some other monocots.  Remaining volumes being prepared will                 treat ferns, conifers, and other dicot flowering plants.  The                   Flora is now used as a standard text in the School of Agriculture               of the University of Guadalajara, attesting to its immediate                    practicality, and is widely cited as a valuable reference work.                 With assistance from his botanical colleague Dr. William                        Anderson, Dr. McVaugh continues to oversee the production of this               splendid inventory.",
