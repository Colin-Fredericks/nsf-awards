 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a laboratory environment where non-                    science students can actively and independently collect, graph and              analyze data over a wide range of physical systems.  The goal is                to instill the excitement and intrinsic interest that should be                 present in the laboratory study of physics even at the most basic               level, while at the same time to make the introductory laboratory               experience more accurately reflect the nature of science in the                 modern world.  The laboratory design must be flexible enough to                 accomodate students with limited mathematical skills and no                     laboratory experience while allowing for completion of the                      experiments with the allotted lab period.  These aims are being                 achieved by equipping the introductory laboratory with computers                in sufficient numbers that there is one for each group of two                   students.  The computers are being used, with appropriate                       interfaces and sensors, to simplify data taking and analysis as                 well as greatly expanding the number and type of physical phenomena             that may be studied by non-science majors.  The data logging and                rapid data analysis of the computers allow the students to use most             of the lab period to think about what they are measuring and to try             variations of the experiment.  The rapid and varied graphical                   presentation of data allows for a high level of analysis and the                introductory laboratory becomes the positive and enlightening                   experience that it should be.                                                                                                                                   The college is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
