This project is directed toward the evaluation of the                           performance, including interpretation and analysis of                           earthquake-response records, of the well-instrumented six                       earth dams which were shaken by the Loma Prieta,                                California earthquake (M=7.1) of October 17, 1989.                                                                                                              The shaking during the main and after shocks triggered                          most of the accelerographs on the six dams (one of them                         is partially damaged) providing the most extensive array                        of earthquake response measurements yet obtained in the                         U.S. and abroad.  The data obtained will be used to (1)                         study the effects of sequential earthquakes on the safety                       of earth dams, (2) correlate dynamic properties (shear                          modulus and damping) extracted from field performance                           during earthquakes, via system identification techniques,                       with existing laboratory-measured properties of the dam                         materials, (3) verify the adequacy of existing procedures                       for seismic analysis of earth dams by applying them to                          observational data and by comparing predicted results                           with measured responses, (4) disseminate research                               findings, and (5) document and improve capability to                            assess the safety of earth dams.                                                                                                                                The study will provide a comprehensive knowledge base for                       evaluation of seismic safety of earth dams.",
