 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the design and analysis of randomized            algorithms while treating randomness as a resource.  Various                    techniques for reducing or eliminating the use of randomness in both            parallel and sequential algorithms will be analyzed.  The approach              involves constructing sample spaces of sub-exponential size and then            using efficient search techniques to reduce the number of random bits           needed to sample from this space.  A complementary approach is to               study the interaction between specific pseudo-random generators and             classes of algorithms.  To identify the limitations of such                     techniques, trade-offs between the use of randomness and other                  resources such as space and time will be studied.  An important part            of the project is the application of techniques to the efficient                solution of combinatorial problems which arise in fields such as                computational geometry and learning theory.                                                                                                                     The use of randomness and probabilistic methods has led to significant          theoretical developments in almost every area of computer science.              However, there are no sources of true randomness and the cost of                generating high-quality random bits is prohibitive.  In this research           a methodology for reducing the dependence of algorithms on randomness           while maintaining their performance quality will be developed.",
