 "awd_abstract_narration": "Formal representation of uncertainty is needed for taking account               of partial knowledge, for dealing with uncertain data, for making               decisions in uncertain circumstances.  Probability theory                       provides the classical way of representing uncertainty, but                     numerous other representations have been proposed.  These                       representations have a lot in common.  This work will survey                    these proposals, with a view to exploring their relations.  One                 approach which may serve to provide a general framework is the                  set-of-classical-distributions approach.  Many representations                  of uncertainty can be construed as sets of distributions subject                to a certain class of constraints.  For example, Shafer's support               functions can be seen as the infima of sets of distributions                    subject to the constraints of convexity and a special additivity                constraint.  This mechanism will be used to explore the relations               among the various views.  Finally, supposing that the constraints               on the set of distributions come from general statistical                       knowledge in a database, this project will explore the problem of               the feasible computation of uncertainties relative to such a                    database.",
