 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Norman Tolk and Royal Albridge, Jr.,             of Vanderbilt University to continue their productive collaboration             in experimental surface physics with Professors Wolfgang Husinsky and           Gerhard Betz of the Institute of General Physics of the Technical               University of Vienna, Austria.  They are carrying out cooperative               investigations of the microscopic electronic mechanisms responsible             for the final states of particles which are emitted from surfaces due           to bombardment of photons, electrons and ions.  Their goal is to gain           basic understanding of the way in which energy from directed beams              may be absorbed, electronically localized and ultimately transformed            at various surfaces into internal and kinetic energies of the emitted           particle.                                                                                                                                                       The Viennese group is a world leader in the detection and characteri-           zation of sputtered particles produced by ion-surface collisions                using optical techniques, in particular, laser-induced fluorescence.            The Vanderbilt group has been studying the strictly electronic                  desorption processes associated with electron and UV photon bombardment         of solid surfaces.  Through collaboration, they have demonstrated               that it is possible using laser-induced fluorescence techniques to              identify specific excitonic and defect channels through which                   incident beam energy flows as it breaks bonds in the surface and                near-surface bulk in pure crystalline materials.  They have also                begun studies of the effect of thin adsorbed layers on desorption               induced by electronic transitions.",
