 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve the preparation of a graduate level text            that will introduce concepts and techniques of stochastic modeling and          statistical analysis in the contexts of ocean and atmospheric                   sciences.  The text, which will be based in part on lecture notes               prepared by the late R. Preisendorfer during his tenure at the Naval            Postgraduate School in the G. Haltnier Research Chair, will fill an             important gap in current scientific literature.  The concepts and               techniques that will be presented in the language and research                  settings of two allied geophysical sciences, provide basic tools for            diagnosis, analysis and prediction of dynamical systems.  Their                 presentation in this form will make them, and their relationships with          the evaluation of hypotheses, more accessible in scientific terms.                Interactive activities include seminars on subjects of                        Dr. Thiebaux's previous research, teaching two graduate level courses,          organization of a workshop on professional careers in physical and              mathematical sciences, and interactions with faculty and students in            their customary university meetings.  The courses and the discussions           following seminars will complement the research component of the                academic visit, while they provide open opportunities for interactions          with students at a critical stage in the formation of their personal            professional expectations.  Finally, the workshop will provide a                concrete look at career opportunities, with the inspiration of women            who achieved major goals.                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
