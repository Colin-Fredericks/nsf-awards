This equipment is maintained for use on or in                       association with the three research vessels operated by the                     institution.  A substantial part of the ships' operating                        schedules during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored research                   projects.  The instrumentation will also increase the                           capabilities of the ships and of the institution to support                     research and engineering activities.  The instrumentation                       includes:                                                                                                                                                       -Shipboard data management systems and components for real-                      time acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large                    environmental data sets,                                                       -CTD sensors, pressure gauges, and other enhancements for                        obtaining detailed profiles of seawater conductivity and                        temperature as a function of depth,                                            -Seagoing computer, disk drive system and other peripheral                       equipment for increasing the reliability and capabilities of                    shared-use CTDs,                                                               -Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler for continuous, underway                      measurements of subsurface circulation features, and                            acoustic backscattering as a measure of the abundance of                        planktonic organisms,                                                          -Precision acoustic transponder for use in determining the                       precise position of a scientific instrument package relative                    to the seafloor, and                                                           -Portable fume hoods for removing chemical fumes from the                        ship's laboratories.                                                                                                                                           The Office of Naval Research is cost sharing the acquisition                    of this equipment.  The instrumentation described above will                    increase the capability of the organization to support NSF-                     sponsored research and engineering projects.",
