 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will improve understanding of the dynamics of                tree death replacement in old-growth forests.  Specific goals are               to investigate the species-and size-specific growth and death                   rates of canopy trees, gap characteristics associated with canopy               tree death, vegetation development in gaps, and the dynamics of                 dead trees.                                                                          These goals will be met by resampling canopy trees and gap                 vegetation originally sampled in old-growth forests of the                      southern Appalachians.                                                               The combinations of data sets on growth and mortality will                 allow turnover in the forests to be studied to a degree                         impossible elsewhere.  These forests are the best example in the                eastern United States of forests likely  to be in long-term                     equilibrium in terms of species composition and ecosystem                       properties.  They will serve as a valuable control for                          interpreting changes in other eastern forests; e.g., determining                whether human activity or changing climate is causing more or                   different changes than usual.  This study also will demonstrate                 how different aspects of species life histories (e.g., canopy                   longevity versus gap-capturing ability) can result in their                     coexistence in diverse forests.  Findings from the analysis will                contribute directly to the knowledge base needed to predict the                 effects of global change.",
