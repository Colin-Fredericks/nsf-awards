 "awd_abstract_narration": "The presence of glycoproteins in bacteria is very rare and                      virtually nothing is known about the mechanisms of protein                      glycosylation in Gram positive bacteria.  The protein crystals                  produced by strains of Bacillus thuringiensis which can be                      larvicidal for Lepidoptera and Diptera insects have recently been               characterized.  The crystals are glycoprotein toxins containing                 roughly 3% covalently bound sugars.  These sugars, which include                both neutral sugars and aminosugars, contribute markedly to the                 crystal's biological activity.  The present proposal (i)                        identifies the oligosaccharide structures from 4 different B.                   thuringiensis crystals including representatives of Lepidoptera-                active and Diptera-active toxins; (ii) determines the peptide                   sequence (Asn - X - Ser/Thr??) of the oligosaccharide attachment                sites; and (iii) determines the pathways for oligosaccharide                    synthesis and attachment in bacteria.  The carbohydrate structure               determinations are done in collaboration with the Complex                       Carbohydrate Research Center at the University of Georgia.                                                                                                      The Bacillus bacteria produce protein crystals that are toxic to                various insect larvae.  The crystals are glycoproteins containing               about 3% sugar.  The sugar residues play an important role in the               crystal's toxicity.  Glycoproteins such as these are uncommon in                bacteria, and little is known about their synthesis by these                    organisms.  This research explores the structure and function of                the sugar portions of glycoprotein toxins in Bacillus.  The long                term goals are to enhance and broaden insect toxicity.  This                    could lead to the development of novel glycoprotein insecticides                effective against previously nonsusceptible insects, such as                    houseflies, mites and ticks.",
