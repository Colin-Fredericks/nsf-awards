 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants are used as the source of many useful compounds                          and mixtures including pharmaceuticals, flavors and                             fragrances, essential oils, enzymes, and pigments.  Large                       markets exist for these secondary plant metabolites which                       are normally obtained by extraction from intact plants.                         Plant tissue culture (PTC) may provide an alternative to                        whole plants as biological sources of these useful                              compounds.  PTC is a technique which allows plant cells                         to be grown in solid or liquid medium in the laboratory                         under carefully controlled environmental conditions.  The                       purpose of this study is to develop a model system for                          studying the potential of strawberry cells grown in                             culture to produce flavors and pigments of interest to                          the food processing industry as natural food ingredients.                       The investigations will include the production of the                           anticarcinogenic compound, ellagic acid, by strawberry                          cell suspension cultures.  Factors that influence the                           kinetics of growth and secondary metabolite production of                       strawberry cells will be systematically studied using                           suspension cultures propagated in roller bottle and low-                        shear cell culture bioreactors.  Information obtained in                        this study will be applicable to other plant cell culture                       systems.",
