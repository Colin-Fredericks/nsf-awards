 "awd_abstract_narration": "In August of 1990, 17 high school physics teachers will have                    the opportunity to participate in an Optical Science workshop                   at San Jose State University (SJSU).  The two week workshop                     will use the He-Ne Laser as a tool to study optics and                          applications of a Laser.  Activities include fifteen basic                      exercises covering geometrical optics, beam manipulation,                       beam modulation, fiber optics, interference, diffraction, and                   holography.  The teachers will literally take away from the                     workshops all the equipment and skills they need to start                       teaching these concepts the following day|  The necessary                       electro-optical devices and equipment are provided by SJSU                      and corporate partners.                                                                                                                                         Prior to the August workshops, a sub-set of five teachers and                   the PI, joined by a visiting scholar from the UK, will set up                   the workshop laboratory and establish, with the educational                     consultant, basic lesson plans.  In addition a menu of                          research (interesting phenomena) topics will be generated.                                                                                                      Follow-up activities include establishing and supporting                        seventeen photonic stations at seventeen different high                         schools in the area surrounding San Jose State University                       through the 1990-91 academic year.  Each station will have a                    laser, oscilloscope, digital voltmeter, and an assortment of                    inexpensive devices sufficient for all fifteen prescribed                       exercises.  These stations will use the cost shared                             equipment.  Teachers use of this equipment will be supported                    on a daily basis through an electronic bulletin board.  Data                    and ideas will be shared via a Newsletter.                                                                                                                      Cost sharing from SJSU in an amount of $27,570 equals 40% of                    the NSF award.  In addition, there are corporate and                            professional association equipment and money cost sharing                       contributions.",
