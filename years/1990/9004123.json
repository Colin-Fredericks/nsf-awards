 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Louis Billera                of Cornell University. Dr. Billera's proposed work is in the                    areas of convex polytopes and multivariate splines, and will                    involve the use of algebraic and combinatorial methods to attack                fundamental questions in each of these areas.                                        Professor Billera's work is unusually interdisciplinary                    within mathematics, with roots in the applied field of spline                   functions as well as in the most abstract parts of commutative                  and homological algebra, algebraic geometry, and combinatorics. A               spline is a thin strip of metal or wood that one may grasp at                   both ends and manipulate to form a smooth curve that not only                   passes through two points (the places where it is held), but does               so in a given direction at each point. The spline functions of                  concern to Professor Billera generally describe smooth shapes of                dimension greater than one, and with a smoother junction at the                 edges than can be gotten, in the case of physical splines, by                   holding the two strips together in the hand. They are of interest               not only within mathematics, but in design, especially of                       automobiles and airplanes, and in solving problems in computer                  graphics.",
