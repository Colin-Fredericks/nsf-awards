 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two.year collaborative project between a                              group of scientists at the University of North                                  Carolina led by Gail E. Henderson, Barry M. Popkin,                             and John Akin .. and Dr. Chen Xiaoshu, head of the                              Institute of Nutrition of the Chinese Academy of                                Preventive Medicine in Beijing.  It is a study of                               health status and health behaviors in the context of                            dynamic social change in China, particularly in the                             countryside.                                                                    In this project, the investigators will survey people                           in 3,000 Chinese households in eight provinces that                             have significantly different economic, demographic,                             and environmental conditions.  They will work in                                coordination with the Institute's established                                   nutrition surveillance sites throughout China.                                  Information will be gathered at the community level                             on the conditions of health facilities, availability                            of transportation to these facilities, and types of                             public health programs.  Information will be gathered                           from households on preventive health behaviors, types                           of health services used, and the cost and method of                             financing health care.  The project is expected to be                           highly beneficial to both American and Chinese                                  researchers.  The Chinese investigators will gain                               valuable experience in gathering and analyzing                                  health.related information and the U.S. group will                              be able to further their research agenda on the                                 determinants of health and nutritional changes.",
