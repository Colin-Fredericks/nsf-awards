 "awd_abstract_narration": "Odors coming to the nose of vertebrates are trapped in a film  of               olfactory mucus, which provides a microenvironment for the                      initial interactions between odorant molecules and the olfactory                receptor cell surfaces.  This mucus is important in determining                 the solubility and diffusibility of the stimuli, and can change                 the response of olfactory receptor neurons to odorants.  The                    mucus is secreted by accessory glands rather than the receptors                 themselves and its composition is variable; it is a perireceptor                modulator of olfactory function.  Neural mechanisms that regulate               the secretion and composition of the mucus may in turn be                       influenced by odorant stimuli.  To fully understand olfactory                   receptor function, these properties and mechanisms must be                      known.                                                                                                                                                          This project will experimentally manipulate the olfactory                       mucosa, and use immunohistochemistry and pharmacology to explore                the relations between odorants and secretions.  Identification of               the innervating pathways to the mucosa will be combined with                    characterization of the neurotransmitters involved in regulation                of secretion.  Odorants and pharmacological agents will be tested               for their ability to stimulate neuromodulator release and                       activate secretion.  Functional carbohydrate compounds will be                  identified in the secretory products, and proteins within the                   secretory cells will also be identified to compare with those                   found in other mucus-secreting systems.  This project involves a                unique approach to the important topic of modulation of sensory                 input, and results will be important to how we think about                      olfactory systems, and modulation of other sensory receptors in                 general.",
