 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on the systematic                      biology of fossorial (burrowing) rodents to be conducted by                     George Cox of San Diego State University and Luis Contreras                     of the University of La Serena in Chile.  The work will                         consist of comparative studies of two aspects of fossorial                      rodent ecology: mound formation and population energetics and                   its impact on plant communities.  The California group will                     focus on the first of these and the Chileans will emphasize                     the second.  Nevertheless, basic data collection procedures                     will be used by both groups to obtain data essential to                         synthetic comparisons of the Californian and Chilean                            relationships.  These two areas are highly similar in soil                      and climactic conditions.  A combination of radiotracking and                   individual marking will be used to follow pocket gophers and                    coruros near their colony sites.  Differences in mound                          building, food caching and tunneling will be studied to                         determine the effect of colonial behavior and differences in                    establishing permanent territories and nomadic behavior.                                                                                                        Comparison of the behavior of these two groups of fossorial                     rodents will reveal characteristics that lead to the production                 of large-scale patchiness, consisting of mounds and temporary                   pond basins in North America but not in Chile.  This will                       contribute to the understanding of recent evolutionary                          history of the two climate ecosystems.  Both scientists and                     graduate students from both countries will participate in the                   field studies of site ecology.  Thus the strengths of both                      groups will contribute to the science produced by this                          collaboration under the Science in Developing Countries                         program.",
