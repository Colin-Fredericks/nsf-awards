 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop materials for two mathematics                         courses for preservice teachers, one course for teachers at                     the elementary-middle school level and one for teachers at                      the high school level.  The related theme of the courses is                     teaching and learning with computing technology.  The course                    for K-8 preservice teachers will center on probability and                      statistics.  The materials development will include                             laboratory-based activities that integrate calculators and                      computers to motivate, enhance and reinforce the learning of                    probability and statistics.  The course for secondary                           preservice teachers will involve students in active learning                    situations designed around cooperative and individual                           investigations of mathematical problems.  Emphasis is placed                    on mathematical problem solving, mathematical modeling, and                     multiple representations of mathematics.  Probability and                       statistics will be the setting for some of the problems.                        Computer technology is used to generate data, perform                           statistical analyses, sketch graphs, draw geometric                             figures, approximate solutions to equations, and carry out                      algorithms.  The materials from both courses will be                            disseminated widely with a special focus on the teacher                         preparation institutions within Michigan.  The NCTM Standards                   will be the basis for decisions about curriculum to be                          included and instructional strategies to be used.  The                          project team will be supported by a team of advisors from                       other teacher education institutions within Michigan and from                   other states.  The advisors have been selected for their                        expertise in technology, mathematics, and statistics.                           Teachers will also be involved as advisors in the project.                                                                                                      The cost sharing will be 50% of the NSF funding for the                         project.",
