 "awd_abstract_narration": "NeXTLab, a computer laboratory in the department of Marine, Earth               and Atmospheric Sciences at North Carolina State University                     (NCSU), is designed to facilitate the teaching of fundamental                   scientific principles to undergraduate students.  NeXTLab                       (consisting of a network of 12 NeXT User workstations and 2                     NeXTLab Servers) will utilize the latest generation of                          workstation technology, one that combines remarkable computer                   power, affordability, and a user-friendly interface.                            Applications in which NeXTLab's technology excels include:i)                    Animation (high-resolution postscript display) to show the time                 evolution of weather systems ozone depletion, pollution                         dispersion, beach erosion, etc; ii) Digital signal processing                   (dedicated chip) to teach turbulent time series analysis, and                   atmospheric remote sensing, etc; iii) Mass storage (660 MB hard                 disk, 256 MB read/write optical disk) a prerequisite for                        animation and signal processing, as well as for applications that               rely on large data bases (eg., global warming, ozone depletion,                 numerical model output).  NeXTLab's innovative programming                      environment allows software developers to create a graphical                    user-friendly interface for educational applications (generally                 the most time-consuming part) without any programming|                          Educational applications will be made available nationally and                  publicized through journal articles to promote the innovative                   use of computer workstations in teaching science in undergraduate               classrooms and laboratory settings.  Support from UNIDATA ( a                   national NSF funded program to distribute \"real time\"                           meteorological data sets) and a new building facility at NCSU                   makes this an opportune time to proceed with development of                     NeXTLab.",
