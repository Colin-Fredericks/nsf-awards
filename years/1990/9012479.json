 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a planning committee effort to consider                     strategies by which behavioral and social science journal editors               might help to reduce misconduct in their sciences.  The planning                effort will examine prior research and related efforts, consider                how to broaden involvement to include a wide range of behavioral                and social science disciplines, and define the problems and                     activities that would respond to them appropriately.  Two committee             meetings are planned.  The first will develop an understanding of               the current status of ethical, legal, methodological, editorial and             public policy issues with respect to scientific misconduct in the               behavioral and social sciences.  It will plan the work activities               for the second meeting and make assignments for work to be done                 preceding that meeting.  At the second meeting, the committee will              develop a needs assessment and a set of recommendations for action              and activities that should follow.  Afterwards, staff and committee             members will work together to prepare a report that will summarize              the current status of efforts to minimize misconduct in the target              sciences, identify gaps in the current effort, and recommend                    further actions to address the problems.  The report will be                    disseminated to relevant governmental agencies and officials and                to behavioral and social scientists and journal editors.                                                                                                        This project focuses on an important issue.  The principal                      investigators and planning committee members are very well                      qualified; planning activities are appropriate and feasible; the                sponsoring organization is very appropriate; results will provide               an important basis for actions that can help to reduce misconduct               in the behavioral and social sciences.  Support is highly                       recommended.",
