 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johns Hopkins University, Cheaspeake Bay Institute will                         operate the R/V RIDGELY WARFIELD during 1990 as a general                       oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.                The R/V RIDGELY WARFIELD is a 106' general research vessel owned                by the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                                             This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.                                                                                                                       R/V R. WARFIELD is a capable platform for these operations.                     Constructed by JHU in 1967, this vessel's shallow draft and twin                hull design are well suited for its principal area of operations                in the Chesapeake Bay.  The marine operations staff at JHU are                  fully capable of meeting the requirements of this proposal.  The                program considers it important to continue the operations of the                R/V R. WARFIELD because it is the only research vessel based in                 the Chesapeake Bay and because of its highly cost-effective                     operation.  The ship supports many cruises of short duration that               would be much more expensive to support and difficult to schedule               using any other vessel in the fleet.",
