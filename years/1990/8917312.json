 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ma's long term goal is to understand how genes are turned on                and off during early Drosophila embryo development and how gene                 activities govern the processes of embryonic pattern formation.                 He will focus on the maternal gene bicoid, which organizes the                  anterior pattern of the Drosophila embryo. The specific aims of                 this project are: 1)Further study of the bicoid protein segments                that are conserved among other proteins involved in embryonic                   pattern formation in both Drosophila and other organisms, 2)                    Understand how bicoid protein turns gene(s) on and off and                      thereby specifies the anterior structures of the embryos, 3)                    Determine whether the only essential function of bicoid protein                 during early embryo development is to stimulate the expression of               the hunchback gene, 4) Understand how modification of bicoid                    protein affects its activity, 5) Isolate and study of Drosophila                genes that modulate the activity of bicoid protein and genes                    whose expression is controlled by bicoid protein. A combination                 of biochemical and genetic methods will be used. To facilitate                  the study, Dr. Ma will continue to use the powerful techniques                  of yeast genetics: various derivatives of bicoid protein will be                generated and analyzed in yeast cells, and new Drosophila genes                 will be isolated using the yeast genetic system. The bicoid                     derivatives will also be tested in Drosophila embryos either by                 injecting the in vitro synthesized mRNA into the embryos or by                  introducing the genes into the Drosophila chromosome.                           %%%                                                                             How genes are turned on and off during embryo development and how               regulation of gene expression in turn directs embryonic pattern                 formation are essential question in developmental biology. This                 study exploits the powerful molecular genetic capabilities of                   yeast combined with that of Drosophila to address these questions               with respect to the initial establishment of the anterior-                      posterior axis of the organism.",
