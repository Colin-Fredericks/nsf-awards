It continues                                    the research that was initiated the day                                         following the Loma Prieta earthquake, namely                                    to collect the perishable data on the seismic                                   performance of soil nailed walls in the San                                     Francisco Bay area.                                                                                                                                             Soil nailing is a construction procedure used                                   to shore vertical soil cuts for temporary or                                    permanent purposes.  Soil nailing differs                                       from conventional soldier pile and tie-back                                     shoring systems in many ways.  The technique                                    was first used in California in the San                                         Francisco area, where numerous temporary and                                    permanent walls have been constructed in the                                    past 5 to 6 years.  The major concern in                                        California with soil nailed walls is their                                      performance during earthquakes.                                                                                                                                 The main objective of this follow-on project                                    is to analyze the data collected so as to                                       obtain a better understanding of the behavior                                   of soil nailed walls when subjected to                                          seismic forces.  Data collected following the                                   earthquake are being compared with the pre-                                     earthquake data to determine the changes in                                     the wall and soil movements, and in the nail                                    resistance.  The performance is being                                           evaluated with respect to soil conditions,                                      wall geometry and construction, and ground                                      motions.",
