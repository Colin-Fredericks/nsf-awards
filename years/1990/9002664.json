 "awd_abstract_narration": "High Speed Signal Processing is an important application of special             purpose numerical processor designs.  These digital processing                  systems involve interconnecting complex integrated circuits or a                large self-contained VLSI design; both implementations contain                  dense electronic structures susceptible to internal temporary and               permanent failures.  Such systems are difficult to protect                      sufficiently by classical fault-tolerant computer design methods                even though these systems also process numerical based data.  This              research examines new methods for introducing efficient fault-                  tolerant design methods in linear signal processing systems without             degrading high speed performance.  The approach is based on block               and convolutional codes used in communication applications for                  error detection/correction in data sequences.  Four specific                    research topics are addressed in this work.  One topic involves the             study of new design and modification options for real block and                 convolutional codes, while another examines the coverage for this               type of algorithmic fault-tolerance.  Practical CAD implementations             are made to provide a basis for assessing overhead complexities.                Software tools to aid designers in incorporating fault-tolerance                easily within practical systems are also developed.",
