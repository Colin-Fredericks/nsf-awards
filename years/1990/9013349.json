 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this project is to research and                               demonstrate a new approach based on neural                                      networks towards the design of process fault                                    detection and control systems.  Past approaches in                              fault diagnostic systems did not properly include the                           human expert's reasoning strategies and experience                              and hence were not adequate in efficient and correct                            trouble-shooting.  This project, will explore a novel                           method using neural networks that address the                                   important issues which are central to the                                       development of knowledge-based systems for process                              fault diagnosis and control.  Our method for                                    developing knowledge-based systems rests on the                                 important characteristics of neural networks, namely,                           their ability to automatically classify and learn                               associations between input and output data and to be                            able to handle noisy data.  The P.I. has already                                successfully tested his approach on a prototypical case                         study involving a CSTR and its support subsystems.                              He plans to investigate this approach further by                                experimenting with larger prototypes of chemical                                process plants as well as for diagnosing dynamic                                process faults.  He also proposes to analyze the                                robustness of this approach to sensor failures, noisy                           and uncertain data, and incomplete information on                               symptoms.  It is also proposed to investigate the use                           of neural networks for modeling the behavior process                            units and their in control.  Furthermore, he proposes                           to investigate the integration of neural nets with                              knowledge-based techniques.",
