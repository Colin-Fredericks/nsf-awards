 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical and structural defenses of the gorgonian coral                    Briareum asbestinum vary among different sites in the Caribbean                 and between depths at a single site.  High site.specific                        variation in types of secondary terpenoid compounds of Briareum                 asbestinum may be environmentally induced.  DR. Harvell will                    determine whether the observed variation in chemical and                        structural defenses of Briareum is genetic or environmentally                   induced and whether it is caused by selection by biotic agents.                 Briareum is distinguished not only by a diverse complement of                   briareins (compounds) in adult colonies, but also a high                        investment in chemical defense of the oocytes, embryos, and                     larvae, affording the opportunity to investigate the ontogeny of                chemical defense in the life cycle.  Despite a decade of intense                research by chemists on bioactive compounds from gorgonians, no                 studies have explored quantitative or qualitative of the life                   cycle.  In the first phase of the project the PI will (1)                       reciprocally transplant clonal replicates of shallow and deep                   adult colonies to measure genetic and environmental components of               defense, (2) determine sources of natural mortality of embryo and               larval stages, and (3) quantify the timing of switches in                       synthesis of major briarein compounds in colony development.  In                the second phase of the project she will (1) collect and analyze                (growth and defenses) the adult transplant, (2) establish                       juvenile transplants and selection experiments, and (3)                         investigate the palatability of briareins to predators using                    bioassays with artificial foods.",
