 "awd_abstract_narration": "True and false morels and allied cup-fungi, which generally                form spore-producing structures aboveground, and truffles, which                sporulate belowground, are Ascomycete fungi placed in the class                 Pezizales.  They are only distantly related evolutionarily to                   true mushrooms of the order Agaricales, class Basidiomycetes.                   True morels and truffles are among the most avidly sought, and                  expensive, edible wild \"mushrooms.\"  Dr. Nancy Weber and her                    colleagues at Oregon State University are studying the patterns                 of morphological variation and geographical distribution in this                group of fungi throughout the western United States, an area of                 high diversity in the group.  Studies of freshly collected                      specimens will complement studies of museum-preserved samples, in               order to determine species circumscriptions and describe reliable               morphological features for identification.  At present there is                 no comprehensive taxonomic treatment of this important group of                 fungi for North America.                                                             In addition to their importance as gourmet foods, members of               the order Pezizales play key roles in forest ecosystems.  Some                  are important as food for squirrels, deer, and other animals.                   Some are mycorrhizal symbionts of forest trees.  In the absence                 of appropriate mycorrhizal fungi, trees take up soil nutrients                  inefficiently and rarely survive for more than a year or so.                    Some Pezizales are saprobes, recycling forest debris.  And some                 are among the first fungi to sporulate following a fire or other                disturbance.  Understanding of the ecological dynamics of western               forests depends in part on accurate identification of these                     mycorrhizal partners of forest trees, to be facilitated by this                 basic taxonomic study.",
