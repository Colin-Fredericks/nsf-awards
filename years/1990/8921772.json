 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to support an American Society for Cell Biology        Summer Conference on the \"Biology of Plant and Animal Extracellular             Matrix\", to be held from June 9-13, 1990 at the Airlie House near               Warrenton, VA.  The extracellular matrix of animal cells, once                  considered mainly in structural terms, is now known to play important           roles in development, homeostasis, repair, cell migration, and control          of prolifereation.  Over the past 10 years it has become clear that the         extracellular matrix (cell wall) of plants not only performs many of            these same functions, but also contains structural/functional                   counterparts.  Thus, animal collagens and plant hydroxyproline-rich             glycoproteins (HRGPs), though un related evolutionarily, represent              similar solutions to similar biophysical problems, as do the complex            carbohydrate polymers that comprise a large proportion of both kinds of         matrix.  In addition, recent evidence for the existence of plant                intergrins and their potential role in cell wall formation indicates            that membrane-ECM interaction are mechanistically linked across large           phylogenetic distances.  With recent development of new methods and             systems for studies of plant and animal matrix recognition/assembly, and        regulation of matrix gene expression, and the realization that many             common principles are likely to exist, an interdisciplinary conference          that brings investigators together to studying plant and animal matrix          biology would be very timely.  The meeting will include a PLenary               Lecture, and ten platform sessions, spread over three and one half days,        in a meeting designed to accomodate 150-300 people.  In addition, there         will be afternoon/evening poster session designed to encourage maximal          interaction among participants.                                                                                                                                      This is a timely and important conference, which is likely to lead         to new and fruitful collaborations and insights.",
