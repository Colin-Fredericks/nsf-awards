 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six students will be chosen to participate in this Research                Experiences for Undergraduates project.  Seven faculty members                  engaged in five research programs will introduce the students to                a variety of possible directions on which to focus their                        energies.  They include work on the phi-transform, a new tool in                harmonic analysis for decomposing general functions as sums of                  simple terms.  It mixes time and frequency considerations,                      providing cancellation in powerful and subtle ways.  Particular                 examples involving electromagnetic scattering, electrocardiogram                analysis and NMR imaging will be studied.  Work on Chern-Moser-                 Tanaka invariants in the theory of several complex variables has                been hampered by the difficulty in calculating the invariants.                  Now it is possible to involve students in the use of symbol                     manipulation algorithms to make estimates and create numerical                  models to study these important mathematical structures.                        Students may also work on mathematical models of molecular                      evolution, (the  distribution of nucleotides in the coding                      regions of individuals chosen from a random-mating population);                 on new high resolution methods for constructing magnetic                        resonance images from raw MR scanner data; on Fourier analysis                  over local fields; and on combinatorial number theory,                          specifically, on the randomness of the distribution of primes.                    Efforts will be made to encourage students to develop their                   work into publishable form or as the basis for senior honors                    theses.",
