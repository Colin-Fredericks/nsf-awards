This conference will be held at Texas Christian                 University May 22-26, 1990.                                                          The use of coordinatization techniques in operator algebra                 arose independently in the self-adjoint and the non-self-adjoint                theories, and practioneers of each subject are largely unfamiliar               with the commonality of technique and purpose in the two areas.                 The principal lecturer is Professor Paul Muhly of the University                of Iowa, whose lectures will introduce coordinatization                         techniques in a non-technical fashion, showing how it arises                    naturally in structural questions about both self-adjoint and                   non-self-adjoint operator algebras, and in applications of both                 types of algebras to a variety of situations.  Particular                       attention will be paid to intertwining results from the self-                   adjoint theory with the non-self-adjoint theory and with pure                   algebra.",
