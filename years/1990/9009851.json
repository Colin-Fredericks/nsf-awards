 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pyruvate and phosphoenol-pyruvate (PEP) are two central                         intermediates in cellular metabolism.  They are the branch                      points of many catabolic and biosynthetic pathways.                             Although the importance of these intermediates has long                         been recognized, the use of both genetic and engineering                        techniques for studying the physiological effect of                             redirected pyruvate and PEP metabolism has not been                             reported.  Pyruvate is not normally recycled back to PEP                        under glycolytic conditions.  Because of this                                   irreversibility, the yields of many specialty chemicals                         produced from glucose via bacterial fermentations remain                        low.  The Principal Investigator proposes to construct and                      characterize strains of the bacteria E. coli which can                          recycle pyruvate back to PEP.  In addition to improving the                     yields of amino acid fermentations, the results of this                         project could contribute to the understanding of how the                        cell distributes its carbon source, and how to decouple                         product formation from cell growth.",
