 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional (e.g., relational) database systems cluster data on                 disks in order to minimize the cost of accessing information;                   such mechanisms are simplistic and are designed before the system               is put into use - and are never changed. But new applications are               making bigger demands on database systems. An example is aircraft               engineering, where multiple designers simultaneously perform                    ever-changing manipulations on complex integrations of electronic               and mechanical engineering components. This is in contrast to                   data processing, where highly-predictable data manipulations are                typically performed. This has caused data clustering to emerge as               a critical area demanding newer and more powerful algorithmic                   results. The goal of the self-adaptive clustering project is to                 consider the wide variety of factors that come into play when one               considers clustering algorithms which are not constructed in                    advance and can adapt themselves to changing, unusual database                  access patterns. This will lead to the development of a theory of               self-adaptive clustering, which will be of great significance to                a wide variety of database users, in particular CAD/CAM,                        software, printed circuit board, and VLSI designers.  This will                 provide a spectrum of software algorithms which will transform                  overly-expensive applications into cost-effective systems.",
