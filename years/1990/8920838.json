 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a very large floating offshore platform                          has become the object of attention for uses such as a                           floating city, an airport for a heavily populated coastal                       city, an isolated locale for a nuclear facility, and a                          platform for waste disposal.  For design of such a very                         large platform, it appears most logical and practical to                        consider the platform to consist of many elemental units                        of relatively small size which are joined at their edges.                       Hence, the significance of estimation of forces and                             moments (including extreme values expected in the                               lifetime) working on the boundary between units cannot be                       overemphasized for design of the very large platform.                                                                                                           Furthermore, the problem implicated in this type of                             platform is that of minimizing the hydrodynamic forces                          and moments necessary to connect the units.  Since forces                       and moments exerted on a body oscillating in waves are                          significantly influenced by its underwater configuration,                       selection of an appropriate underwater configuration of                         the units will provide extremely important information                          for the design of the platform.",
