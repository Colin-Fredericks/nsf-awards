 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction systems where both reactants and products are in the                   liquid and solid phase (no vapor phase present) are being used                  commercially to produce high molecular weight monomers or                       intermediates used in the production of specialty and                           commodity polymers.  Specific examples include bisphenol A,                     paradichloro-benzene and n-methyl phthalimide.  Other classes                   of materials that must be processed in the melt include                         elemental and compound semi-conductors such as silicon and                      gallium arsenide, and superconducting materials such as                         barium/copper/yttrium/oxygen systems.  One advantage of some                    of these two phase systems is that reaction and separation                      occur in the same unit, greatly reducing processing costs.                                                                                                      The structure and properties of multicomponent solid-liquid                     phase diagrams play and important role in determining the                       behavior of these unit operations (also referred to as melt                     processing units).  The PI plans to develop a broad                             comprehensive theory of multicomponent reactive solid-liquid                    phase diagrams that will produce practical rules for                            conceiving and designing melt processing systems.  These                        systems have unusual phase equilibrium behavior when reactions                  are present, including the appearance of reactive azeotropes                    in ideal mixtures.  These and other features normal azeotropes                  in non-ideal mixtures.  These and other features of the                         equilibrium behavior influence what can and cannot be achieved                  in reaction-separation systems.  The PI plans to use certain                    invariants from differential geometry to provide a complete                     classification of the phase behavior, and ultimately to                         predict it, from an incomplete knowledge of the equilibrium                     relations.  The ultimate goal is to develop a broad                             fundamental understanding of reactive melt processing that                      will lead to useful guidelines for the synthesis and design of                  such systems.",
