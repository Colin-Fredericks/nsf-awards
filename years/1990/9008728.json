 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wilse Robinson is funded by a grant from the                          Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the role which                 water and other solvents play in chemical reactivity.  These                    studies are extremely important in order to further our                         molecular level understanding of chemical reactions which take                  place in solution.                                                                                                                                              Robinson's research is directed toward a better molecular-level                 structural description of the ultrafast dynamics of solvent                     participation in chemical reactions.  The methodology of these                  studies will combine picosecond and femtosecond spectroscopies                  with intuition gained from supercomputer modeling and pure                      theory.  Water as a solvent is a special case, and will be the                  focus of much of the research effort.  It is a highly                           structured liquid having moderately strong directional bonding.                 The presence of specific solvent structural moieties in                         fundamental ionic reactions involving the proton, the hydroxyl                  ion and the electron is indicated.  Perturbations by foreign                    cations and anions, by pH, temperature, pressure and by the                     addition of other solvents will be elucidated.",
