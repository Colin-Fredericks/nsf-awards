 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the late first millennia A.D. the interior of southern Africa                witnessed the rise of complex societies, based both on                          agriculture and pastoralism and characterized by large towns with               central enclosures surrounded my massive carefully faced stone                  walls.  The most famous of these, Zimbabwe, is located in the                   fertile highlands of the country with the same name.  Work by Dr.               James Denbow and other archaeologists has demonstrated that this                same phenomenon extended into the less hospitable Kalahari Desert               to the west and that several easily defended mesas contain                      evidence of dense settlement.  Data also suggest that such sites                served as central places in large settlement systems which                      covered thousands of square miles.                                                                                                                              With National Science Foundation support Drs. James Denbow and                  Edwin Wilmsen will continue their research on these Botswana Iron               Age settlements.  In the first of two field seasons they will                   excavate at the sites of Botsutswe and Mmapudi.  The former is a                large mesa site, the latter a smaller one which presumably is                   part of the same system.  Through surface survey and excavation                 the size and distribution of materials at each site will be                     determined.  Analysis of materials such as ceramics and trade                   goods will provide information on both external contacts as well                as status differentiation both between and within sites.  In the                second season the team will conduct exploratory research in an                  outlying area, presumably with little contact with the core, to                 locate sites for potential excavation.                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   light on how complex societies arise and are maintained.  It will               also provide insight into how humans adapt to harsh and                         unpredictable desert environments.  The conclusions may provide                 guidelines for successful herd management strategies in drought                 ravaged areas of Africa today.",
