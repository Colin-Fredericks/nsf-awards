 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of S-substituted cysteines are major constituents of the               non-protein amino acid pool in species of genera which are                      widely-separated taxonomically.  Enzymes are present which act as               C-S lyases and by a beta-elimination reaction yield, in many                    cases, the characteristic odors and flavors of those plants used                as food.  In addition the garlic and onion enzymes are of                       particular interest because the products produced also appear to                have marked effects in a number of medical applications.  There                 is one C-S lyase which is present in all autotrophic plants.                    This is cystathionine-beta-lyase (EC 4.4.1.8) which is required                 in the biosynthetic pathway of methionine.  The other C-S lyases                studied to date do not utilize cystathionine as a substrate or do               so very poorly.  This proposal clarifies the evolutionary                       relationships among various C-S lyases that have been purified to               homogeneity by determining the structural homologies which exist                in the protein molecules.  Typical examples of each type of lyase               have been obtained in a homogeneous state and by the use of                     peptide mapping and immunological cross-reactions, the homologous               regions, if any, are being determined.  The active site peptide                 should be distinguished from the others because of the pyridoxal-               5'-phosphate bound as the secondary amine after reduction.                                                                                                      Studying the conservation of protein structure among proteins                   with similar functions in different organisms has been one                      approach to elucidate evolutionary origins and relationships.                   This project examines the degree of relatedness of a group of                   enzymes limited to a few widely-divergent plant families whose                  substrates are S-substituted cysteines, which are common                        secondary metabolites in these families.  Determining the                       evolutionary relationship between these enzymes is important both               agriculturally and medically.  There is considerable commercial                 interest in these enzymes in several species such as garlic,                    onion and broccoli because of their relationship to the                         characteristic flavors and odors associated with these                          vegetables.  Furthermore, the products resulting from these                     enzymes have potential medical applications and have aroused                    pharmaceutical interest.",
