 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports collaborative work by                       theoretical physicists Dr. Steven Pieper at Argonne National                    Laboratory and Dr. A.R. Bodmer at the University of                             Illinois-Chicago, and in the area of microscopic theory of                      hypernuclei Dr. Q.N. Usmani at the Jamia Millia Islamia in New                  Delhi.  They have previously made calculations of S-shell                       hypernuclei, A binding to nuclear matter and AP scattering data                 using simplified NN interactions, and have shown that a                         consistent description of these data can be achieved with AN and                ANN interactions consistent with meson exchange models.  The                    proposed work will combine this effort with work by                             Dr. Pieper at Argonne in developing a variational program for                   computing the ground-states of closed-shell nuclei using                        realistic two-and three-nucleon interactions.  The combined                     programs will extend the closed-shell program firstly to allow                  for one or two A particles and secondly to allow computation of                 P-shell hypernuclei.  The objective is to obtain a more detailed                knowledge of the AN and ANN interactions.  The problem of                       baryonic mixtures and AE coupling will also be studied.                                                                                                         Scope:  This project enables two highly qualified scientists, and               their teams, to continue and expand collaborative research that                 had started several years ago and resulted in significant                       publications.  The project will enable the Indian team to acquire               capabilities for extensive mathematical analysis and calculations               necessary for this work and to greatly contribute to the                        development of the theory of hypernuclei.  The project is one in                which the collaboration is especially beneficial to both sides.",
