 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of our research program will be to                             make progress toward the development of control                                 system design methodologies which support the                                   following control system design paradigm: Minimize                              control system complexity subject to the                                        achievement of a specified control accuracy in the                              face of system/environmental uncertainty.  A key                                focus of this research program will be the role and                             use of information and organization for the                                     achievement of this paradigm, as the nature and                                 use of available information, and in particular how                             it is organized, largely determine how effectively the                          control system reduces the effects of                                           system/environmental uncertainty, and what level of                             complexity is required to do so.  The task in our                               research program will include the development of                                control-oriented system identification methods.  In                             this work we have developed methods for                                         identification H-infinity; in other words, the                                  identified model converges to the unknown system                                in the H-infinity norm, and at each step an explicit                            bound is given on the H-infinity norm of the error                              between the identified model and the unknown                                    system.  This bound is precisely the uncertainty                                specification required in most currently popular                                approaches to robust control system design.                                     Applications feedback will be essential for the                                 achievement of our immediate goal of better                                     bridging the gap that currently exists between the                              areas of robust control and system identification.                              For this purpose we have in mind an important                                   application; namely, active control of                                          fan/compressor stall phenomena in advanced                                      variable-cycle aircraft gas turbine engines.",
