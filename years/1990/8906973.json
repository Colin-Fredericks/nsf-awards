 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in graph theory of                        Professor Cun-Quan Zhang of West Virginia University. Dr. Zhang                 intends to continue his program of research on the topic of paths               and cycles in graphs, from the threefold point of view of cycle                 coverings of graphs, local connectivity and Hamiltonian                         connectivity, and the question of longest cycles and their                      chords.                                                                              The beginnings of graph theory go back perhaps two hundred                 years, but it is mostly in the last half-century that the field                 has become an active, fertile, and flourishing branch of                        mathematics. A graph is a network of lines (\"edges\") joining                    points (\"vertices\"), so that the language of graphs becomes a                   natural way of describing interrelationships among separated                    entities. The uses of graph theory abound not only in                           communications theory but in surprisingly many parts of                         mathematics, both pure and applied, as well as theoretical                      computer science.",
