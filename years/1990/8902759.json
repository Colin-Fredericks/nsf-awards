 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exact steady solutions of the inviscid incompressible flow                 equations can be constructed by superposing helical waves.  Such                flows have the Beltrami property that the vorticity vector is                   everywhere parallel to the velocity vector.  Beltrami flows may                 have very complicated three-dimensional structures; in                          particular, fluid particle trajectories may be chaotic and space-               filling.  Chaotic particle motion is important in determining the               effective eddy diffusivity of a flow, and its small-scale mixing                properties.  Chaos is also likely to influence concentration and                coagulation in suspensions of particles whose densities are                     different from the fluid.  The amplification of magnetic fields                 in electrically conducting fluids is yet another effect in which                chaotic flow play a major role.  The PIs will study the chaos in                a number of Beltrami flows and explore its implications for these               physical problems, how the chaotic properties depend on the                     complexity of the flow.  The numerical work will be performed on                a hypercube multiprocessor, which can follow the motion of a                    large number of particles simultaneously.",
