 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ziurys' Presidential Young Investigator Award will be used to               study interstellar chemistry.  In the laboratory she will measure               transition frequencies of molecules which are potentially present               in interstellar clouds but which have not yet been observed.                    With the rest frequencies known, she will then carry out                        observations to search for these molecules in selected molecular                clouds known to be undergoing star formation.                                                                                                                   It is currently thought that most interstellar molecules are                    formed by gas phase positive ion-molecule reactions.  About 50%                 of these reactions are exothermic.  They also have negligible                   activation energy barriers, and they require only 2-body                        collisions.  Thus, they can proceed rapidly in the low                          temperature, low density environment of interstellar molecular                  clouds.  When stars form in these clouds, however, the physical                 conditions become altered.  Under these circumstances, activation               energy barriers are readily overcome, endothermic reactions can                 occur, and what is termed \"shock\" or \"high temperature\" chemistry               takes place.  In addition shocks and elevated temperatures can                  cause the destruction of dust grains and release refractory                     elements into the gas phase.  It is evident that this \"high                     temperature\" chemistry must be important in the synthesis of                    molecules in star forming regions, but its exact role has yet to                be determined.  Dr. Ziurys' research addresses both the                         laboratory measurement of the properties of molecules which are                 potential constituents of the \"shocked\" regions of interstellar                 clouds and the astronomical observations to search for these                    molecules in space.",
