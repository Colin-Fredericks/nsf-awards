 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the history of the development of the first ballistic missile                and the development of the US ballistic missile and space                       programs, it is clear that Wernher von Braun played a central                   role.  While several biographies have been published about von                  Braun, these studies tend to be anecdotal, inaccurate and                       hagiographical.   None of them have used the full range of                      archives available both in the US and Germany about von Braun's                 life and work.  Dr. Neufeld ultimately wants to write a full                    biography of von Braun.  Under this grant, however, he is                       examining only the first, seminal part of von Braun's career, his               work at Peenemunde in the development of the V-2 rocket.                        Specifically, Dr. Neufeld is examining the institutional and                    managerial origins of the remarkable technological success of                   Peenemunde, in particular the construction of an                                Army/university/corporate research and development empire of von                Braun, General Dornberger, and others in the Third Reich.                       Second, Dr. Neufeld is investigating the relationship of von                    Braun and his associates to Nazism, and their knowledge of, and                 responsibility for war crimes committed in the production of the                V-2.  These studies will have considerable historiographical                    significance in their own right because they will ground the                    Peenemunde and von Braun story in thorough archival research.                   They will also place these developments in their proper context                 of important historical debates on the role of the state and the                military in 20th century technological change, on the character                 of science under Nazism, and on the nature of the war economy and               political system in the Third Reich.",
