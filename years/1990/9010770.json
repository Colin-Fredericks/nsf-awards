 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Bayesian formulation of optimization and search problems                 that are distinguished by very lax assumptions is adopted in this               research.  The optimality criterion for algorithms is the                       minimization of dispersion of the conditional probabilities with                respect to the observations.  The research addresses the                        theoretical issues of consistency of optimal myopic algorithms,                 characterizations of algorithms, and the development of efficient               algorithms that are not sensitive to probabilistic assumptions.                      Problems of optimization and search with partial information               abound.  A common situation is to start with minimal information                about the function to be optimized or the object to be found and                then make observations that improve our information.  An efficient              choice of observations is a difficult and important problem since               some choices may be much more informative than others.  While                   problems that fit this description are commonplace, there is very               little theory to guide in planning sensible strategies since the                strong assumptions needed for most optimization or search methods               can not typically be justified.",
