 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremes in environmental conditions such as low and high temperature,          drought, and high salinity, severely limit the geographical                     distribution of plants and account in large part for the shortfalls             between potential and actual crop yields.  Many plants, however, have           evolved mechanisms that enable them to acclimate to and survive to              varying degrees, different forms of environmental \"stress.\"  The long           term research interest of the Principal Investigator is to understand           at a molecular and cellular level the adaptive responses that plants            make to survive cold and freezing temperatures.  He has recently                established that Arabidopsis, like many other plants, becomes more              frost tolerant when exposed to low nonfreezing temperatures and that            changes in gene expression occur during this cold acclimation process.          His goal now is to determine the functions of the cold-regulated                (\"cor\") genes.  His specific aims include: the isolation and sequencing         of cor genes; determining whether COR polypeptides have cryoprotective          effects; the construction and analysis of Adrabidopsis cor mutants;             determining the cellular and subcellular location of the COR gene               products; and determining whether Arabidopsis cor genes are highly              conserved among plants.  At a minimum, these studies should provide             additional insight into the molecular and physiological changes that            occur in plants at low temperature.  They also have the potential of            yielding genes that could be used to improve the cold and freezing              tolerance of agronomically important plants.",
