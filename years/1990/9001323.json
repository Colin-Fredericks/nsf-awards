 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sugar maple is one of the most widespread and abundant                     deciduous forest trees in eastern North America.  Populations of                sugar maple continue to expand in forests in the corn belt states               of the U.S., but at the same time appear to be declining in parts               of the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada.  A number of                  causes for this \"sugar maple decline\" have been suggested,                      including effects of both gaseous air pollutants (especially                    ozone), and acidic precipitation.  Rather than acting as the                    proximate cause of death of individual trees, such diffuse                      environmental factors act by placing trees under chronic stress.                Such stress-weakened trees then become more susceptible to attack               by insect pests or diseases which actually kill the tree.                            In this study, the investigators will examine the effects of               ambient ozone, and of slightly elevated ozone, on a number of                   important, basic physiological processes in sugar maple:                        photosynthesis, respiration, transport of sugars among plant                    parts, and accumulation of starch stores for overwintering.  They               hypothesize that ozone injury to leaves will reduce the                         photosynthetic rate and force the plant to use more of the energy               it does obtain through photosynthesis to repair damage.  In                     addition, they hypothesize that the system the plant uses to                    transport sugars from leaves to roots may be directly damaged by                ozone.  These changes will have the effect of reducing the amount               of food (as starch and sugar) that the plant can accumulate for                 survival over the winter.  Thus, they expect overwinter mortality               to increase, and growth during the subsequent spring to be lower,               in plants exposed to ozone.  The investigators will also extend                 these experiments to screen individuals from populations in areas               of sugar maple decline and unaffected areas to determine if                     sensitivity to ozone varies geographically.  The results of                     these experiments may reveal much about the basic ecophysiology                 of sugar maple, and will also allow insight into the more applied               problem of sugar maple decline.",
