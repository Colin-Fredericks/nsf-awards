 "awd_abstract_narration": "While the vast computational requirements of numerical                     forecast models dictates the use of relatively coarse                           resolution, there is still a need to provide a forecast                         tailored to local areas.  Currently, the forecasting of local                   weather elements such as precipitation, surface temperature,                    winds, and so forth are done by a statistical adaptation of a                   large-scale forecast model.  The principal investigator and his                 colleagues will develop a model that computes the physical                      processes that locally modulate the large-scale meteorological                  fields.  The parameters of such a model need to be adjusted to                  the local conditions.  In doing this work, these scientists                     will employ the adjoint model technique, a tool of optimal                      control theory, to do this adjustment, that is, to find the set                 of parameters that minimize the local forecast errors.  This                    research will allow the development of models that can be                       tailored to the specific needs of users of local forecasts                      such as utility industries, airports, agricultural entities,                    etc.  There are many other potential applications of the                        technique such as the calibration of satellite observations of                  ground characteristics, and the indirect measurement of                         quantities that are difficult to measure routinely in situ such                 as soil moisture.",
