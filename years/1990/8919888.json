 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wallen has developed a model that integrates the central               effects of hormones with peripheral mechanisms affecting their                  metabolic fate that has direct relevance to the development of                  human steroid replacement therapies.  From work with humans and                 primates, it is clear that removal of female ovaries or damaging                their ability to function drastically reduces sexual interest and               satisfaction.  A critical problem is which steroid hormone or                   combination of hormones can mimic the action of the ovaries and                 adrenals on these behavior.  This is further complicated since                  blood of female rhesus and human females contains special                       proteins that can tightly bind estrogens and androgens.  When                   hormones are attached to these proteins, called sex hormone                     binding globulins or SHBG, they cannot affect the nervous system                and are inactive.  When they become unattached from the protein                 they are once again active.  Although both steroid hormones bind                to SHBG, androgens bind more tightly than estrogens.  Dr. Wallen                is examining whether the binding of androgens to these special                  blood proteins frees estrogens to influence behavior.  His work                 will clearly define the role of both estrogens and androgens.                   Furthermore, finding that SHBG strongly influences the behavioral               effectiveness of ovarian and adrenal steroids will markedly                     change current views of hormone action.  The outcome of his                     innovative work will provide new information on how steroid                     hormones interact to modulate their individual dynamics and                     effectiveness and could lead to the development of better                       hormonal treatments for humans with endocrine disorders.",
