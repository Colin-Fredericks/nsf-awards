This research will be                 conducted at Pau Brasil Ecological Station in Porto Seguro,                     Bahia, Brazil  (16-23'S, 39-11'W).  The station has a 1000 ha                   reserve of Atlantic rain forest, an endangered ecosystem                        suffering strong pressure from agricultural expansion; an                       arboretum with approximately 40 species from the forest, all                    planted in monospecific stands, with similar age and on the same                soils; and other experimental pure and mixed-tree plantations.                  Preliminary results (June 1989) showed low soil N availability                  during early establishment of pure and mixed-tree stands,                       possibly with high competition with the soil microflora.                        Planning activities will include:  a) to examine species/site                   relationships for the species in the arboretum; b) to study                     factors controlling N availability in existing pure and mixed-                  tree plantations; c) based on this information, to design mixed                 plantations taking into consideration the potential ameliorating                effects of trees on soils, and their nutrient requirements for                  complementary use of nutrient resources.  This type of research                 is broadly important to the field of ecology, and will provide                  significant information regarding Conservation of tropical                      forests.",
