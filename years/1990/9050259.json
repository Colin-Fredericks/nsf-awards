The            television set cum computer chip could be linked by broadband networks          or in other ways to archieves of digitized information, including text,         sound and moving images.  Such a development would hold profound                educational and unique educational opportunity; examine the educational         and social benefits of this development for new and existing learners;          and conduct and disseminate the results of this inquiry in a way that           alerts public and private decision-makers to actions that can affect            this unique opportunity.  Specifically, this activity will:                                                                                                     o   synthesize what is presently known about factors affecting the                  development and cost of the digital home terminal; switched                     broadband communications to the home, school and work place; and                public and commercial digital databases;                                    o   assess the educational and social benefits of a national information            infrastructure for use in and outside of school; and describe new               options for public and private financing of this infrastructure for             educational use;                                                            o   develop descriptions of a series of contingent options for getting              from here to there;                                                         o   assess the effect on the direction and rate of development of the               national information infrastructure, if public and private decision-            makers were to take into account the educational needs that                     electronic information services could serve;                                o   assess the reaction of affected educational constituencies,                     including reformist movements, to this new educational opportunity,             and to effects on publicly-financed schooling; and                              strive actively during and at the onclusion of the study to                     disseminate the concept and results of this inquiry.",
