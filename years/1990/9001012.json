 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical work on modeling,                      analysis and design of numerical algorithms for physical systems,               the behavior of which is heavily influenced by non-local effects                in time, space and both.  Three classes of such systems are                     investigated.  The first comprises viscoelastic and thermoelastic               time-memory models, the second concerns interface problems                      arising in elastic and electromagnetic scattering by                            inhomogeneous obstacles, some of which involve non-local                        operators in space and time, while the third focuses on reaction-               diffusion problems in population genetics with state-dependent                  diffusion velocity.                                                                  A central theme of this research is a careful study of the                 strength of damping mechanisms induced by non-local effects and                 the influence of damping on well-posedness, including                           variational formulation techniques, asymptotic behavior, and                    approximation of non-local effects to facilitate easier                         implementation of numerical methods.  The problems require the                  development of delicate analytical and numerical techniques                     coupled with a thorough understanding of the underlying physics.                     Some of this work builds on a recent paper in which the                    concept of steady-state power loss is introduced as a measure of                the strength of damping for models with singular kernels.  It is                expected that this point of view will prove valuable in the study               of global well-posedness and limiting behavior.",
