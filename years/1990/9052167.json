 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests equipment that will enable                          the Department of Geological Sciences at University of                          California, Santa Barbara to provide advanced laboratory and                    lecture media capability of its students.  Over the years, the                  UCSB geology faculty have shown strong interest in developing and               using computers and advanced visual presentation media to                       teach undergraduate courses.  Presently we are, with both                       University and Apple Corp. funding, creating a videodisc                        (consisting of slides, animations, and video clips) for use in                  our Oceanography course, an extensive interactive tutorial for                  Optical Mineralogy and Crystallography, and an interactive                      tutorial on the evolution of the North American continent from                  Phanerazoic to the present. The interactive tutorials are                       demonstration projects being implemented with SuperCard on color                Macintosh computers. The potential use for this kind of material                is enormous.  We want to create an environment where students can               browse through a side range of geological information in support                of their laboratory and coursework, access tutorials of                         geological topics, and communicate with their professors through                electronic mail over a network.  We hope that this will also have               the affectof softening subject matter boundaries, integrating                   diverse branches of the geological sciences.  A high speed                      network connected to computers in the laboratories, combined with               presentation equipment, will allow the students and lecturers to                have access to a much wider range of instructional material than                they would otherwise.  All or the material would also be                        available to students outside of the laboratory.  We are                        requesting equipment for use in student labs, department network                support for availability of the material department and                         campus.wide,equipment in support of lecturing (using the                        computer's display and animation capability), and computers for                 faculty use in lecture, laboratory, and tutorial materials                      preparation.",
