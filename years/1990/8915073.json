 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in applied mathematics                 to be conducted by Tadeusz Balaban of Boston University and                     Ricardo Schor and Michael O'Carroll of the physics department                   of the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Belo Horizonte,                    Brazil.  The problem is the ultraviolet stability of three-                     dimensional spinor quantum electrodynamics and the application                  of renormalization group methods to low temperature classical                   spin models, such as the Heisenberg model.  These researchers                   have been working on infrared properties of small perturbation                  models of the free lattice electromagnetic field and a                          renormalization group approach to spinor electrodynamics.  In                   the first case they have proved the infrared asymptotic                         freedom for these models and have recently published the                        results.  For the second problem, the two-dimensional model                     of spinor electrodynamics is well known but the three-                          dimensional model is a much more difficult problem.  They                       have started work on the latter case using the renormalization                  group approach.  This award will support this new work in                       which the ultraviolet stability will be investigated, first                     for two-dimensional classical spin models and then, after                       modifications, for the three-dimensional case thus extending                    a successful and productive preliminary collaboration.",
