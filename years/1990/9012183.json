 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support a project to determine the                          transport, fate, and effects produced by protozoa in a                          plume of organically contaminated groundwater as                                influenced by physical and chemical conditions of the                           contaminated aquifer, and to determine the role that                            protozoa play in influencing the numbers and kinds of                           bacteria that survive transport through a contaminated                          aquifer.  This project includes field studies in                                cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey (Ronald W.                          Harvey) at its Groundwater Contamination Site located at                        the Otis Air Force Base on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  The                        project also includes a subcontract with the British                            Museum of Natural History (Colin R. Curds).                                                                                                                     This project addresses factors of great significance in                         determining the role that protozoa play in affecting                            microbial populations in aquifers that have been                                contaminated by organic chemicals.  Results may be applied                      in engineering design of systems for decontamination of                         aquifers by use of a bioremediation process alone or as                         part of a system including physical and chemical                                processes.",
