 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on research in multibody dynamics, and                     addresses computational issues therein.  It is directed toward                  improving computational procedures in three ways: 1) by                         developing more efficient and more accurate analysis procedures                 and algorithms; 2) by developing consistent approximation                       procedures; and 3) by developing improved methods for applying                  the technology.  The research is motivated by a desire to address               problems in robotics, biosystems, flexible structures, cable                    dynamics, and colliding system dynamics.  Despite rapid advances                in multibody dynamics, there remains a great deal to be done.                   Disagreements exist regarding the best method for obtaining the                 governing dynamical equations, how redundant and constrained                    multibody systems are to be studied, how to incorporate                         flexibility effects into the analyses, and how to use                           supercomputers and parallel processing in multibody analysis.                   Kane's equations of dynamics will be used in this project.  They                are amenable to efficient automatic generation of the dynamical                 equations, and useful in studying constrained and redundant                     systems.  They also have advantages for systems with flexible                   members.  This research proceeds on five fronts including the use               of absolute angular velocity components as generalized speeds,                  automated modelling, impact analysis, subcomponent analysis of                  small mass portions of the system, the use of orthogonal                        complement and projection methods, development of Class VI                      computer procedures, and the use of animated computer graphics.",
