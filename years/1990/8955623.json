 "awd_abstract_narration": "Essex Community College will initiate a 4-week, commuter, Young                 Scholars project in Environmental Science for 20 students in grade 8.                                                                                           This project allows young scholars to work with research scientists and         science teachers in laboratories and at field stations to complete              independent research projects in environmental science, thus motivating         and encouraging them to pursue careers in environmental science.  The           focus of the program is to demonstrate to the students that                     environmental science is founded on interdisciplinary research based on         chemistry, biology, mathematics, and electronics.  Therefore, pertinent         components of each of these disciplines that relate to environmental            science is presented.  The 4-week summer camp serves as an intensive            training period during which time the students attend lectures and learn        skills which they will use to design and carry out environmental                research projects during the academic year. Students use biological             monitoring techniques, classical ecological study methods, and chemical         assays to study the ecological effects of particular primary pollutants         on specified study areas.  Each student then prepares a written summary         of their work, in journal style, and presents the findings at a mock            symposium to be held during a follow-up weekend retreat which takes             place at the end of the academic year.",
