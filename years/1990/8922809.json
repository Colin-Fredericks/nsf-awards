 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with her                   current NSF funded research of variable stars.  Her observing plan              at the Maria Mitchell Observatory is to 1. photograph variable                  stars in order to maintain and extend the variable star data base               established at the Observatory, 2. analyze the data of selected                 variables for period changes (a task primarily performed by student             assistants), and 3. search for unknown variables.  The work takes               time, with each star presenting its own problems.  Slow, steady                 period changes caused, for example, by stellar evolution will be                studied using the Observatory's photographic archives.  Stars with              more complicated periodic behavior will be investigated by a                    remotely-accessed, automatic photometric telescope on Mt. Hopkins,              Arizona.  The scientific goal of the project is to determine the                structure of pulsating variable stars.                                                                                                                          The educational goals of this proposal are to include students with             interest and talent in the natural sciences in all aspects of the               proposed research and to provide them with realistic hands-on                   experience, as the Maria Mitchell Observatory has done for many                 years.
