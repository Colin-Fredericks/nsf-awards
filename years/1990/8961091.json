 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new memory cell using magnetic films and High Critical                        Temperature Superconductors (HCTS) is examined for application                  in supercomputer mass memories.  Magnetoresistive Random Access                 Memory (MRAM) technology has densities projected in excess of                   108 bits/cm2, but at these high densities read-access times are                 limited to about 10 microseconds.  With the proposed memory                     cell, signal-to-noise ratios are improved by a factor of about                  30, which would decrease access times to about 10 nanoseconds.                  It may also offer a significant cost reduction in random access                 memory systems.                                                                                                                                                 Supercomputer performance is increasingly dominated by                          performance of the memory hierarchy, particularly access time                   of disc memory.  Installing and maintaining a liquid nitrogen                   cooling system may be an acceptable cost for improved                           supercomputer performance utilizing the subject memory scheme.                  If feasible, this concept may substantially advance                             supercomputing technology, and as nitrogen cooling becomes less                 expensive, it could have widespread use in both mainframe                       computers and work stations.",
