 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on variation that occurs within a                      species in three-dimensional branching structure of root                        architecture and determine the extent to which the variation is                 genetically controlled or results from environmental factors.  In               the future, the relationship between root architectural traits                  and root function will be explored to determine the importance of               particular root structure to the overall performance of the                     plant.                                                                               The study species is the herbaceous perennial Cryptantha                   flava (Boraginaceae) which occurs in very sandy soils throughout                semi-desert regions of eastern Utah and parts of adjacent states.               Because of the inherent difficulty of extracting roots from soil,               quantitative descriptions of root architecture and studies of the               relationship between the branching architecture of roots and root               function are virtually undeveloped.  Such information is basic to               understanding how plants capture soil nutrients and water.                           Root structure should have particularly important                          consequences in desert systems where soil resources, rather than                available sunlight, limit plant growth.  The species selected is                amenable for these studies because the basic branching pattern of               its roots is easily quantified and because nearly entire roots                  can be extracted from the sandy soil.  Results of the study could               (1) help explain the distribution and performance of plant                      species across different soil types and (2) contribute                          information important to the development of crops--particularly                 those tolerant to drought or low nutrient soils.",
