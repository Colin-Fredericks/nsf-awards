 "awd_abstract_narration": "The red algae (Rhodophyta) are richly represented in marine                environments from the tropics to the polar regions.  They are                   readily distinguished by their color, the result of a unique                    combination of photosynthetic pigments, and by the universal                    absence of flagellated cells, an apparently ancestral condition.                Most species are capable of sexual reproduction.  The life cycle                typically involves three generations or phases: a haploid sexual                phase, a diploid phase that grows in a semi-parasitic fashion                   directly on the female plant, and a free-living diploid phase.                  It has been suggested that the triphasic life cycle and complex                 patterns of sexual reproduction and spore development that                      characterize nearly every family of red algae evolved as                        compensation for an inefficient fertilization mechanism in the                  absence of motile sperm.  Some of the most elaborate reproductive               structures are found in the Gigartinales, a large order currently               containing about 40 families.                                                        The Gigartinales, like most red algae, are composed entirely               of branched filaments in which the cells are linked by special                  structures called pit connections.  These cellular connections                  can be specially stained and observed by light microscopy, and                  the stages of vegetative and reproductive growth thus followed                  cell by cell, event by event.  Dr. Max Hommersand of the                        University of North Carolina is making comparative studies of                   growth and reproductive development in several problematic groups               of Gigartinales, to determine consistent patterns that reflect                  taxonomic relationships.  The morphological evidence obtained                   will be used to test hypotheses about the multiple origins of                   auxiliary cells and connecting filaments in relation to other                   taxonomic characters.  Results obtained in this study will be                   used in revising the classification of these red algae and to                   determine evolutionary lineages among them.",
