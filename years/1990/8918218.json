 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project development workshop in robot intelligence in                   manufacturing between Harold Liebowitz, George Washington University,           and V. Milacic, University of Belgrade, the participants will review            topics in robotics research with the twin objectives of developing              cooperative research projects between the U.S. and Yugoslavia and               identifying research gaps in the field.  The workshop's agenda includes         \"current\" topics such as cognitive and neural structure of robotic              intelligence, autonomous and distributed robotic systems, intelligent           sensor systems, robots for non-structured assembly tasks,                       telerobotics, computer hardware and software for robotized                      manufacturing systems, and multi-hand, multi-effector robotic                   structures.  Workshop participation is balanced.  U.S. and Yugoslav             research interests and expertise are complementary and the university           and industrial communities in both countries are well-represented.                                                                                              This project was approved by the U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on                   Cooperation in Science and Technology and will be jointly support by            NSF, under the SDC and ENG programs, and the U.S.-Yugoslavia Joint              Fund, which consists of matching funds from both governments. The U.S.          contribution to the Joint Fund is provided annually by the Department           of State.",
