 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project intends to define the chemical and electrical                 properties of two connected parts of the brain termed the medial                septum and diagonal band of Broca.  One unique function                         postulated for neurons of these brain regions is their ability to               serve as generators for a specific electrical activity referred                 to as \"theta rhythm\".  This particular rhythm has been associated               with normal developmental and behavioral phenomena such as                      learning and memory, and abnormal behaviors such as dementia,                   depression, and affective disorders.  However, the specific                     neurons within the complex under study responsible for the                      generation and/or modulation of theta rhythm and the cellular                   mechanism underlying this electrical activity are not known.  Dr.               Joel Gallagher has postulated that the neurons in this complex                  are heterogenous.  As a result, different types of neurons serve                different functions.  These different neurons may be identified                 and characterized on the basis of their intrinsic electrical                    properties, their unique cellular anatomy and their complement of               receptors for transmitters and modulators.  Although the medial                 septum and diagonal band of Broca has been investigated as a                    general entity, Dr. Gallagher will examine each component of this               complex in order to begin to understand how specific neurons in                 each component receive and transfer information at the cellular                 level.",
