 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies supports research on the social values                and mutual obligations and responsibilities that arise in the                   interactions of science, technology and society.  This project                  takes an interdisciplinary approach to addressing ethical concerns              raised by applications of computer technology in education.                     Increasingly, various forms of computer technology are being                    applied in education in ways that bear on student-teacher                       interaction and the learning process, on educational values toward              human interaction and individualization.  In this project, a                    philosopher, psychologist, and human development specialist,                    working with an educational computing consultant, will carry out                an empirical inquiry into the ways in which computer-assisted                   instruction (CAI) affects student behavior and attitudes in a                   particular context.  The context is the use of CAI programs as a                standard part of undergraduate courses in Deductive Logic.                      Findings will help to shape future development of the CAI programs              and of computer applications in education that are simultaneously               guided by ethical perspectives on their social and psychological                consequences.  Results are expected to be of interest to a wide                 audience, including philosophers, psychologists, and professional               educators.  Findings will be written up for publication in several              journals and presented at national meetings.                                                                                                                    This project focuses on an important issue in ethics and                        undergraduate science education.  The investigators are highly                  qualified; the institutional sponsor is appropriate; the research               promises to give us some unique information about impacts of                    computer technology in at least one area of the curriculum, as well             as development and testing of a variety of data collection methods              which can then be applied to other curriculum areas.  Results are               likely to be of wide interest and appropriately disseminated.  The              project is strongly recommended for an award.",
