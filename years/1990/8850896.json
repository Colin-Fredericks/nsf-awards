 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) in collaboration               with the Charles River Museum of Industry will use the history of               technology to introduce students in American history classes to                 applications of chemistry, physics and engineering.  \"Discovering               Science and Technology through American History:  A Pilot                       Project\" will stimulate greater interest among middle and high                  school students in science and technology and will demonstrate to               them the impact of science and engineering on their daily lives.                The broader goal of this unconventional approach is to encourage                students to pursue academic study of science and engineering.                   The technology selected to achieve these goals is textiles and apparel          which students care about personally and one that deals with both               science and engineering.                                                                                                                                        The essence of the project will be eight modular curriculum units which         can be inserted into American History survey courses without disruption         to existing curricula and teacher lesson plans.  The units will be              prepared by a group of eighteen middle and high school teachers and             historians of technology. Curricular packages will include detailed             lesson plans, bibliographies for students and teachers, background              essays for teachers, descriptions of student projects, black line art           and diagrams which teachers can photocopy for classroom use, experiments        and videotapes.  The units may include some simple artifacts and                indicate where others can be obtained.                                                                                                                          The Society for the History of Technology has the technical expertise           and the resources of the Charles River Museum provide a strong                  information base for the development of the project.",
