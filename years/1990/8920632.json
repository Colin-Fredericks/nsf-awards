 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years the organization of the agricultural sectors of                 various Marxist regimes have evolved along several different                    paths.  In a few  countries the sector has become decentralized                 and, in China, individual farming has been restored.  In others                 the farm units have become increasingly amalgamated, both                       horizontally and vertically.  And in still other nations the                    governments are attempting to combine elements of increased                     centralization and decentralization.  The purpose of this project               is to explore the underlying reasons for and impact of these                    different types of changes.  More specifically, this project will               explore four problems: the form, speed, and extent of                           collectivization; the prerequisites for agriculture                             decentralization; the underlying reasons for the spread of                      vertical and horizontal amalgamation; and the growth of total                   factor productivity in the agricultural sector in a group of                    comparable Marxist and non-Marxist nations.  This research is                   important because it will help us better understand the nature                  and evolution of collective of agriculture.",
