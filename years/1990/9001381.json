 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Program is supporting the research of Dr.                 Kevin M. Smith of the Department of Chemistry at the University                 of California-Davis.  Professor Smith is engaged in a                           broad-based and wide-ranging study of the synthesis,                            biosynthesis, chemistry, and spectroscopy of chlorophylls and                   bacteriochlorophylls.  Chlorophylls are the catalysts in the                    vital process of photosynthesis and are involved in light                       gathering (antenna systems) as well as in the process of charge                 separation (in the reaction center).                                                                                                                            Current work focuses on the investigation of the chemical and                   biochemical basis for the methylation of bacteriochlorophyll-c                  and -d pigments which causes shifts in the cell absorption                      maxima, enabling the bacterium to adapt to conditions of low                    light.  Esterifying alcohols on bacteriochlorophylls-c and -d                   molecules will be correlated with age of culture and extent of                  alkylation.  Biosynthetic studies will also be undertaken;                      these involve biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophylls-c and -d,                    using isotopically enriched (carbon-13 and carbon-14)                           precursors to determine the branchpoint from chlorophyll-a                      biosynthesis and the latter stages in bacteriochlorophyll-a                     biosynthesis.                                                                                                                                                   A chemical synthesis of chlorophyll-a and its 4-vinyl analog,                   conversion of the former into the latter, and a biomimetic                      ring-cleavage of chlorophyll derivatives for chemical synthesis                 of certain photochemically active active bilins (e.g.                           phytochrome, which regulates plant growth and development) will                 be studied.  Finally, chiral chlorophyll derivatives will                       facilitate synthesis of chiral N-alkylporphyrin ferrochelatase                  inhibitors, and chemical and electrochemical cyclizations of                    tetrapyrroles to give porphyrins will be investigated.",
