 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is very little research on emergency                                      preparedness during periods of routine                                          operations.  Most studies concentrate on the                                    immediate response during post-impact disaster                                  periods but pre-event linkage patterns are                                      important for understanding response actions.                                   Research is needed that accurately describes                                    the normally established multiorganizational                                    networks of community preparedness across                                       functional areas such as search and rescue,                                     food provision, medical supply stockpiles,                                      public shelters, and mobilization of                                            volunteers in conjunction with other emergency                                  personnel.                                                                                                                                                      The goal of this research is to strengthen                                      disaster preparedness by deepening and                                          refining the understanding of how organization                                  work together.  The study will examine the                                      underlying processes producing the patterns of                                  interorganizational relations in the                                            preparedness network of St. Louis, Missouri,                                    an area which is at risk to many types of                                       hazards including earthquakes.  The empirical                                   focus of the study will be on the system of                                     negotiations that underlie the definitions of                                   resources and responsibilities among a sample                                   of organizations for meeting the needs of                                       disaster victims.  The study has implications                                   for large urban areas in the U.S. threatened                                    by natural hazards.",
