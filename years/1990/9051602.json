 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a Computer-Integrated Electronics                 laboratory for undergraduate instruction.  The laboratory is                    composed of ten workstations, each containing an IEEE-488                       networked digital oscilloscope, arbitrary waveform generator,                   digital multimeter, and a 386-based PC equipped with math co-                   processor, VGA graphics, 80 MB hard disk hardware and SPICE                     simulation, scientific graphing, schematic and printed circuit                  layout design, data management and wordprocessor software.                                                                                                           This laboratory provides the medium for the integration of                 computers and computer technology into the instruction of                       Electronics.  The measurement equipment, computers, and software                constitute a complete workstation environment allowing computer                 controlled automatic testing and measurement of electronic                      circuits and systems, data/signal acquisition, data/signal                      processing, circuit design, schematics drawing, printed circuit                 design and layout, and electronic circuit simulation.  This                     laboratory simultaneously meets the needs of introductory and                   advanced electronics courses, exposes the student to modern                     computer interfaced instrumentation and computer aided circuit                  design, and provides on-site simulation and data/signal                         processing tools.  It also provides an integrated environment                   for undergraduate research and design projects.                                                                                                                      The award is being matched with a greater, 158%, amount by                 the principal investigator's institution.",
