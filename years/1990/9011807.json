 "awd_abstract_narration": "American politics, it is argued, is representative of the forces of             American public opinion.  That representation emerges over time as              politicians and other policy actors sense change in national mood, and          respond to it.  Public mood is considered to be a vague and general set         of orientations toward public policy.  Not support or opposition for            particular policies, or particular variations in particular policies,           it is considered so general that its effects are seen in each of the            domestic policy debates of a particular period.  Systematic movement            of such moods produces political eras, times when the public is willing         to go along with particular kinds of policy changes, but to restrict            others.  The 1960s, for example, is widely considered a time when the           public was tolerant toward liberal sorts of policy experimentation              across the board, while the (early) 1980s is the reverse case.                  These ideas have wide, almost universal, currency in political                  commentary, so much so that many would think their truth too obvious            for research.  But in political science there is no role at all for             moods and eras in prevailing conceptions of public opinion.  There it           is usually thought that attitudes toward policy particulars arise from          the policy debate itself, are specific reactions to specific questions.                                                                                         Or in political psychological approaches they arise because they meet           needs of the opinion holder.  If moods and eras exist, then because             information of this sort is abundant and cheap, it is likely that               policy actors would sense them.  It is likely also that acutal policy           choices would be affected, that for example, those who sensed                   supportive moods for their positions would take stronger positions.             This would produce a kind of over-time representation of a quite direct         and meaningful sort.  Changes in public preference would lead to                changes in policy.  This is a conception of \"representation\" that is a          good fit to democratic theory, but quite different from our usual focus         on the concept in geographical terms - - districts and representatives.         \"Mood\" as a purely mass phenomenon has been successfully measured in            the past by this investigator.  The key is the analysis of policy               preference \"marginals\" - - the percent who chose one or another                 response to a question - - over time and issues.  The measure uses the          leverage of very large numbers of issues and time points to overcome            the inherent shortcomings of the marginals as data and the biases               arising from highly selective measurement and reporting.  A methodology         is developed for measuring the central tendency of time series of such          preferences.  This project moves on to the next tasks at hand for the           study of mood representation, (1) exploring whether mood might have             more than one dimension (such as \"economic\" and \"social\" components -           - widely believed to be the case but without supporting evidence), (2)          developing measures of public policy outcomes on a left-right scale             over time, in order to (3) examine the statistical link, if indeed it           exists, between changes over time in public preferences and changes in          public policy.",
