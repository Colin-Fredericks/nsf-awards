The strong ground motions recorded in the San                                   Francisco Bay Area during the Loma Prieta                                       earthquake exceeded the levels predicted by                                     standard empirical attenuation relations.  A                                    preliminary analysis of these records                                           suggests that this may have been a result of                                    critical reflections of the seismic waves                                       from the base of the crust.                                                                                                                                     The objective of this proposal is to perform                                    further analyses and simulations using an                                       expanded data base that includes recordings                                     of other events of the earthquake sequence in                                   order to rigorously test this and other                                         explanations for the large ground motions                                       observed.                                                                                                                                                       Evaluating the cause of this observed                                           departure from predicted levels of ground                                       motion has important implications for                                           estimating ground motions from future large                                     earthquakes on the San Andreas and Hayward                                      faults.  It also has implications for other                                     regions in the United States such as the                                        Seattle-Portland region where crustal                                           earthquakes having deep focal depths may                                        similarly elevate ground motions to damaging                                    levels at distant locations; and in the                                         Seattle, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City and                                        other regions where basin response effects                                      are expected to be significant.",
