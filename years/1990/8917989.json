 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kosso is concerned in this project with the structure of                    archaeological knowledge.  He is focusing specifically on the                   role of observation in archaeology and on the status of                         observation as objective evidence for claims made about the                     past.  The demonstration by philosophers of science that                        observations are theory-dependent is as relevant to                             archaeological observations as it is to the natural sciences,                   and understanding the empirical basis of any science requires                   addressing the problem of theory-influenced observation.  Dr.                   Kosso's most recent work has shown that we can concede to a                     certain amount of theory-dependence in observation without                      sacrificing the objectivity of the observational evidence if                    we insist that the theories which influence an observation are                  independent from the theory for which the observation is                        evidence.  This concept of independence as a standard of                        empirical evidence has been successfully applied to examples                    in the natural sciences.  Dr. Kosso is now applying the same                    methodological apparatus to analyze observational evidence in                   archaeology.  This analysis is potentially of significance to                   archaeologists with a concern for empirical foundations of                      their science as well as to philosophers interested in the                      structure of scientific knowledge.",
