 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite a general consensus that Hudson Strait played a                         prominent role in controlling the dynamics of the Late                          Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet, including perhaps the                         tempo of deglaciation, comparatively little detailed field                      work has been accomplished along its coastlines to identify                     what role it played.  Consequently, reconstructing the                          history of Late Wisconsinan events in Hudson Strait has                         become a critical objective toward understanding the                            dynamics and behavior of the Laurentide Ice Sheet.  What                        information is now available from field work along its                          coastlines indicates a more complex and dynamic sequence of                     events than previously considered.                                                                                                                              The purpose of this research is to contribute toward a                          better understanding of late Quaternary events in Hudson                        Strait as recorded on northern Labrador, including the                          eastern coast of Ungava Bay.  This region occupies a                            critical are for examining (1) the interaction of Hudson                        Strait ice with ice flowing through Ungava Bay, (2) the                         carbonate-drift belt across northernmost Labrador, with its                     important indicator erratics to identify provenance, and                        (3) deglaciation of outer Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay.                         Results of this research will provide necessary information                     for reconstructing events in outer Hudson Strait that                           ultimately affected a large part of the Laurentide Ice                          Sheet.",
