 "awd_abstract_narration": "Activists seeking to persuade government officials to                      implement particular policies often try to mobilize public                      opinion and widespread public displays of support.  Their ability               to do so is affected not only by their own skills, but by the                   extent and nature of their linkages with a larger constituency,                 and by their relations to other political actors.  In European                  democracies, this especially includes political parties.  Public                support for an issue which is initially popular may actually                    decline as the issue becomes politicized.  Activists cannot                     control public opinion, and must instead change their own ideas                 in response to these shifting definitions of an issue.                               For this project, longitudinal survey data on a Dutch \"peace               movement\" campaign are analyzed statistically to provide input                  for theorizing.  The data were collected in the Netherlands                     before and after a massive campaign in which millions of citizens               sent the government postcards opposing deployment of Cruise                     missiles.  The campaign ultimately failed when the government                   approved deployment.  Surveys have been completed for samples of                the general public in four communities, as well as for all                      activists in those same four and six additional communities.                    Theory developed in light of the data will show how the costs and               benefits that underlie collective action are themselves                         constructed in light of political allegiances and identities.",
