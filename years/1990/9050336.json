 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Minnesota will conduct \"Research                              Explorations for Teachers,\" a program for 50 secondary                          teachers from Minnesota to join University faculty research                     teams.  Research projects are in areas such as: ecology and                     behavioral biology, microbiology, geology, neurology, human                     genetics, soil science, archaeology, anthropology, etc. Most                    projects will take place in Minnesota; some, abroad.  In                        addition to participating in the research projects of their                     choice, teachers will attend three seminars conducted by                        University faculty that will focus on the use of research in                    classrooms, recent trends in scientific research, active                        learning styles, and curriculum development.  Teachers will                     receive both financial support and instructional assistance                     for developing curricular materials related to the content                      and inquiry-based approach of their research experiences.                       Curricular material resulting from these projects will be                       distributed in at least three ways: (l) at meetings of the                      Minnesota Science Teachers and the Minnesota Council of                         Social Studies Teachers; (2) through the publication and                        distribution to district curriculum specialists of the best                     materials created by teachers in this program; and (3) at                       in-service days of participating school districts.                                                                                                              An amount equivalent to 18.7% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
