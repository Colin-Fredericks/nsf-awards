 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project combines geometry and function theory                 in several complex variables to study how the geometry of a                     domain influences the properties of holomorhpic functions defined               on the domain.  Although progress has been made recently in                     understanding domains whose complex geometry is not excessively                 degenerate, so-called domains of finite type, the general state                 of knowledge is still limited.                                                       Among the most manageable classes of holomorphic functions                 defined on a domain, those which are square integrable are                      probably the most useful.  It is possible to convert any square                 integrable function on a domain into its nearest holomorphic                    neighbor by a process of integration against a kernel function -                the Bergman kernel.  There is a unique such kernel for each                     domain and integration projects each function onto the best                     holomorphic approximant.  Perhaps the most important question                   related to holomorphic functions on domains is that of                          determining whether or not the projection preserves functions                   which are differentiable on the boundary of the domain.  Are                    their images also differentiable on the boundary?  Even                         experienced mathematicians would consider the likelihood of such                an event an accident.  The facts are otherwise.  If the boundary                has a smooth, curved shape (pseudoconvex) then the projections                  are always differentiable.                                                           Work will continue in an effort to extend present results to               domains which are not pseudoconvex.  Among the more tractable                   domains to be analyzed are the Hartogs domains.  These are                      domains possessing some circular symmetry.  Several                             counterexamples in function theory have been found in Hartogs                   domains.                                                                             Ultimately, this work will be applied to the general problem               of analyzing biholomorphic mappings between domains in several                  complex variables.  These maps are known to have smooth                         extensions to the respective boundaries in many instances.                      A complete description of the domains for which these smooth                    extensions exist is probably the most important question under                  investigation in several complex variables at this time.",
