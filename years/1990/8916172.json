 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of two new experimental methods (TDEX and                  QMEX) to answer questions relating to hygroscopicity, composition               and the state of mixing for atmospheric aerosols will be                        investigated.                                                                        The thermal deconvolution experiment (TDEX) is designed to                 provide a measure of the two dimensional probability of                         occurrence surface over the plane having coordinates \"aerosol                   size\" and \"aerosol volatility.\"  In this way one can gain                       insight into the molecular composition of aerosol samples broken                down by size class; it is also possible with TDEX to derive                     information on the state of mixing of aerosols and to infer the                 presence of surfactant films on aerosol cores.                                       The Quartz Mass Water Uptake Experiment (QMEX) yields                      information on the hygroscopicity of aerosols in different size                 classifications.  Here, aerosols are size-sorted by impaction                   onto vibrating quartz crystals (Quartz Crystal Microbalance).                        By determining the alteration in resonant frequency as a                   function of relative humidity, one can measure Hnels exponential                mass increase coefficient.  These size-specific hygrograms                      represent important information on the physical chemistry of the                aerosols and have application in cloud physics and atmospheric                  radiative transfer.                                                                  The project will attempt to answer questions about the                     physical chemistry of aerosols in air mass types specifically                   chosen to provide examples of natural aerosol processes in the                  free atmosphere.  Of particular interest are aerosol debris that                has been cycled through nonprecipitating marine clouds, well-aged               (e.g. 10-20d) industrial aerosols imported as Arctic haze to                    Alaska, smoke from wildfires in the Siberian a Canadian taiga,                  and aerosols in air masses enriched in terpenes.",
