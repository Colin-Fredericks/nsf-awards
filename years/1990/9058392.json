 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be carried out focusing on renewable                              resources and waste treatment.  The capabilities of                             living  systems will be explored in this context, using                         an integrated approach employing engineering, biological,                       and chemical principles.  A particular focus is                                 fundamental understanding which could make a contribution                       toward the realization of applied goals.  Specific areas                        of interest include ethanol production from                                     lignocellulose, and anaerobic waste treatment and                               remediation.                                                                                                                                                    Current and anticipated research related to ethanol                             production addresses metabolic control of product                               formation, cellulase kinetics, and bioreactor design.                           Thermophilic bacteria and enzymes are of particular                             interest.  Investigation of metabolic control will                              involve coupling understanding of microbial physiology                          and energetics with engineering approaches to                                   manipulating the fermentor environment in order to                              increase ethanol yields.  Bioreactor design for                                 continuous fermentation of lignocellulosics at high                             concentrations will be pursued both experimentally and                          theoretically.  This will encompass consideration of                            plug-flow cellulose distribution, differential residence                        time of both cells and substrate due to substrate-broth                         density differences and cell-substrate adhesion                                 phenomena, and modeling and understanding in vivo                               cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation.                                                                                                                          Approaches to anaerobic waste treatment and remediation                         will include selective inhibition of sulfate-reducing                           bacteria (SRB) via biochemically-based strategies.  In                          addition, the physiological basis for the relatively                            incomplete treatment often obtained by anaerobic systems,                       and possible solutions to this problem, will be                                 addressed.  Finally, the use of anaerobic systems for the                       detoxification of hazardous wastes will be investigated,                        including both engineering and biological considerations.",
