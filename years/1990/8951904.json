 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the acquisition of three data acquisition and             signal processing systems to assist in implementing an innovative               approach in teaching instrumentation to undergraduate students.                                                                                                 The new approach addresses the need to teach digital data acquisition           and signal processing techniques such as:  concepts of dynamic system           response, data sampling, leakage, aliasing, transformation, and others          to mechanical-engineering undergraduate students.  In the newly                 designed instrumentation curricula, spectrum analyzers are being used           much like oscilloscopes were used previously.  The significance of this         new approach to undergraduate instrumentation is due to the fact that           industry heavily uses these techniques while they are not taught in the         schools (at least in mechanical-engineering curricula).                                                                                                         These principles will be taught not only in the class room environment          but also through newly designed laboratory experiments in two                   undergraduate instrumentation courses.  The equipment will provide the          laboratories with three work stations consisting of personal computer           controllers, data acquisition and signal processing peripherals, and            appropriate signal condition and excitation hardware.",
