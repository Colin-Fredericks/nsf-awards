The primary                   goal of this research project is to determine the various                       background variables that influence attitudes toward                            innovation in science.  Professor Sulloway's research design,                   which is multivariate and epidemiological in nature,                            encompasses 80 variables and nearly 3000 participants in 28                     highly diverse scientific controversies.                                                                                                                        Based on preliminary research and multivariate modeling                         techniques, the most significant predictors of attitudes                        toward scientific innovation include (in order of importance):                  birth order, which mediates differential identification with                    parents and authority; time elapsed since the announcement of                   the theory; age; political and religious attitudes; personal                    contact with the originator of the new theory; and national                     differences.                                                                                                                                                    Professor Sulloway is examining three areas of further                          research.  First, he is refining these statistical models by                    obtaining questionnaire data on the nature of each scientific                   controversy and the theoretical changes that ensued.  His                       questions are also aimed at testing various assumptions                         regarding the nature of scientific change that have                             preoccupied philosophers of science.  Second, he is developing                  specific models for individual debates that will allow the                      rigorous testing of historical hypotheses.  Lastly, he is                       completing data collection for this project.",
