 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a Small Grant for Exploratory Research                        (SGER) in plant-pathogen interactions.  The mechanism by                        which breakdown products of the plant cell wall are                             transported or taken up into phytopathogenic Xanthomonas,                       Erwinia and Fusarium species is the major focus of this                         research.  The uptake of radiolabeled galacturonic acid into                    plant pathogens is being measured to determine the kinetics                     of transport, the number of transport systems, and the                          inducibility of cell wall degrading enzymes.                                                                                                                    The SGER mechanism was selected for this project because of                     the high cost of custom synthesis for the requisite                             radiolabeled compound.  The element of risk involved is more                    than would normally be assumed in a fully funded, multi-year                    project.  Some preliminary observations make a strong case                      for the project and it is highly likely that new information                    will be gained of a basic nature as well as on the processes                    of soft-rot diseases of many agriculturally important                           plants.***",
