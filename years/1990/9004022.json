 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to assemble for discussions a                   select but representative group of scientists who are actively                  working at the forefront of research on the biochemical                         mechanisms used in site-specific recombination and transposition.               This interrelated group reactions lie at the heart of a number                  of very important biological processes: integration of                          retroviruses generation of antibody diversity, transmission of                  antibiotic resistance genes, rearrangement of bacterial                         chromosomes and mobility of eukaryotic introns.  The oral                       presentations at this Workshop will emphasize the mechanistic                   aspects of these recombination reactions.  There is currently                   rapid progress in this area, and a specialized meeting for                      leaders in this field should be both timely and productive.  The                roster of speakers includes several scientists who have pushed                  the analysis of recombination for the first time into the realm                 of enzyme kinetics, as well as many scientists who have applied                 other types of biochemical, genetic and topological analysis.                   Topics will include retroviral integration, reactions of the                    integrase and resolvase families, Holliday junctions,                           immunoglobulin rearrangements, prokaryotic transposable elements,               and Drosophila P elements.  We are also encouraging poster                      presentations from scientists working in systems which are not                  yet amenable to mechanistic analysis.  This should serve both to                broaden the biological base of the meeting and to encourage those               working in relatively undeveloped systems to undertake a more                   mechanistic approach.  The meeting will be limited to 100-135                   participants.  This number is sufficient to include all of the                  principal investigators who are working productively in this area               as well as a reasonable sampling of post-doctoral fellows and an                occasional outstanding graduate student.  However, this number is               small enough that efficient interchange amongst all the                         participants is still possible.",
