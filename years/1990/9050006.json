 "awd_abstract_narration": "National calls for augmenting statistical literacy are increasing, but          are not accompanied by basic and applied knowledge about the development        of statistical reasoning in children.  The present project is designed          to enhance our understanding and serve as a basis for development by            both teachers and curriculum designers in this emerging area.  Five             major research questions are addressed:  (1) How do children acquire            strategies used for data analysis?; (2) What are the effects of domain-         speific and everyday knowledge on statistical reasoning?; (3) What are          children's beliefs about statistical?; (4) What if any differences in           statistical reasoning exist across gender and socio-cultural background?        and (5) How well do teachers understand statistical reasoning?                                                                                                  To address these issues, data will be collected over on 320 children,           selected from 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th grades, drawn from middle-class and        inner-city schools in Philadelphia.  Data will be collected from                children in both individual and group assessments, as well as from              school records.  Finally, given that teachers' own knowledge is related         to how well children learn in school, a study of 80 elementary school           teachers will be conducted.  An innovative video workshop and written           manual will be developed for teachers as a way toward improving the             provision of knowledge about statistical reasoning in classroom                 settings.  Findings are expected to be crucial in the sequencing of             knowledge provision in school settings, so as to take advantage of              children's developing knowledge and strategies in the broad domain of           statistical reasoning.  Since the acquisition of statistical reasoning          skills also serves as a \"gatekeeper\" to careers in science, mathematics,        and technology, it is hoped that the results will provide useful                information to enhancing the opportunities for female and disadvantaged         students in entering these areas of study.",
