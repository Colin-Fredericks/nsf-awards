 "awd_abstract_narration": "This undergraduate project implemented a versatile and reliable                 analytical technique that has become the method of choice for                   many of today's more difficult chemical analysis problems.  A                   Shimadzu LC-6A High Performance Liquid Chromatographic system                   (HPLC), with refractive index, fluorescence, uv/visible                         absorption, and electrochemical detection systems, provided                     flexibility  high sensitivity, and low detection limits.  Trace                 metal and organic analysis of various matrices are very important               in fully evaluating the quality of an industrial process and in                 determining safe consumable projects.  Realistic and \"real world\"               opportunities are available to undergraduate chemistry and                      chemical engineering students interested in industrial and                      government careers that emphasize quality control and                           environmental investigations. Practical applications of HPLC                    involve the analysis of aqueous industrial effluents, natural                   products, polymers, forensic samples, and a host of commercial                  products including cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and pesticides.                  Chemistry and chemical engineering majors are able to vigorously                pursue undergraduate research projects by designing and                         developing separation and detection methods.  They utilize                      various detection systems, columns, solvent matrices, and                       chromatographic techniques like normal reverse phase, ion-                      exchange, and ion pair chromatography.                                                                                                                          The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
