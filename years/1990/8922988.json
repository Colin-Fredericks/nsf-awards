 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will continue the application of asymptotic                  methods to aid in the performance evaluation of different types                 of queueing systems, such as large queueing networks, interactive               computer systems and communication networks.  These asymptotic                  methods allow one to estimate performance criteria even when an                 exact solution is not available, and the approximate answers                    they provide are very often highly accurate when compared to                    exact solutions for simpler cases and numerical simulations.                         Most people do not enjoy waiting in line.  In a more general               sense, such \"waiting problems\" occur frequently in computer and                 communication systems.  For example, when you make a long                       distance call the telephone company's computers may have to put                 your call into a waiting line if there is a large number of calls               in progress at the time of your call.  Depending upon how                       efficiently the phone system is able to prioritize your call you                may be able to complete your call or you may hear a recorded                    message informing you to try again.  Similar problems arise when                computers \"talk\" to each other:  if the queueing of data is not                 done properly then the transmission of data is either slowed down               or stopped completely.  With this research the principal                        investigator will use approximation techniques to provide                       estimates of waiting times in various computer and communication                systems.",
