 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear polymeric films offer great promise for very fast opto-               electronic devices.  While further research is needed to obtain still           more efficient nonlinear performance in robust, inexpensive materials,          it is very important to proceed with device research.  In particular,           it is crucial to investigate the appropriateness of current materials           for device applications.                                                                                                                                        The best materials now offer electro-optical coefficients comparable            to the best inorganics.  Polymer thin films are attractive because              they can be readily deposited on semiconductors and metals to create            novel device structures.  Such applications are beyond the                      capabilities of the standard inorganic materials.  However, still               larger electro-optic coefficients will be needed to obtain useful               effects in such thin films.  Thus, this proposal addresses the need             for interferometric structures which rely on multiple-pass optical              structures to provide large enhancement of the electro-optical                  coupling.                                                                                                                                                       If significant improvements in molecules and film quality are not               forthcoming, such multiple-pass devices may be the only practical use           in electronics of the organic and polymeric nonlinear materials.  If            such improvements are obtained, interferometric devices will still              offer much larger sensitivity than single pass devices, providing               enhanced performance.                                                                                                                                           A variety of multilayer film structures will be analyzed, fabricated            and tested.  Particular attention will be paid to global optical                interconnects between integrated circuit processors and memory.",
