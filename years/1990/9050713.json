 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a high performance, multi-user computer system                  supports senior-level realtime instruction.  Students use the                   networked, graphics-oriented system for data acquisition, reduction,            analysis and presentation.                                                                                                                                      The laboratory system provides high speed analog-to-digital and                 digital-to-analog conversion; TTL-compatible digital input and                  output; programmable counters/timers; two large screen, high                    resolution color graphics workstations; and access to the campus                ethernet backbone.  Both low-level and icon-based data acquisition              and analysis software are available as well as a realtime version of            UNIX operating system.  Also included is the industry standard                  networking and computer graphics software.                                                                                                                      This distributed system allows students to experience modern,                   distributed laboratory computation.  Individual students will be able           to simultaneously edit source code and reduce data remotely through             network access, while one project group acquires new data and another           group analyzes and displays old data on the two workstations directly           connected to the realtime host.  Student access to the specialized              hardware and software is maximized.                                                                                                                             The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
