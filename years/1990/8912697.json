 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dean M. Roddick of the                        University of Wyoming will synthesize transition metal                          complexes which contain perfluoralkyl tertiary phosphine                        ligands. These ligands are electron withdrawing and will render                 the metal and ancillary ligands of the complexes electron poor,                 which will lead to a new kind of chemical reactivity and new                    approaches to the activation of coordinated dinitrogen, for                     example. The coordination and reactivity of nitrogen is funda-                  mental in the process of \"fixing\" nitrogen from the atmosphere                  for useful purposes such as the production of fertilizer. The                   metal complexes may also have applications as catalysts for                     carbon-hydrogen bond activation, which is an important step in                  the conversion of hydrocarbons, especially methane, to more                     useful fuels such as methanol.                                                                                                                                  The ligands employed will be 1,2-bis(diperfluoroalkylphosphino)                 ethane, primarily the perfluoroethyl compound, and analogous                    phosphines. The resulting electrophilic complexes of these                      ligands will then be investigated for hydrocarbon activation                    and dinitrogen coordination. One such complex formed, toluene-                  (dinitrogen)molybdenum(perfluoroalkylphosphine), and various                    analogues, will be examined for the electrophilic reactivity of                 the coordinated dinitrogen with nucleophiles such as organo-                    lithium and hydride reagents. The metals to be emphasized in                    these studies are chromium, molybdenum and tungsten. The syn-                   thetic studies on the perfluorophosphines will continue with                    the aim of finding more effective ligands.",
