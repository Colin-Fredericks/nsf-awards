 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns scientists' judgments regarding the                       anticipated buildup of carbon dioxide and other \"greenhouse gases\"              in the atmosphere.  Since there are major gaps in scientific                    knowledge about the greenhouse effect, policy makers are forced to              rely on scientists' judgments about the rate of climate change and              its effects.  It now appears that significant policy decisions will             have to be made in spite of continuing uncertainty and disagreement             among scientists.  Despite its importance, scientific judgment                  about the greenhouse effect has not been systematically studied.                                                                                                Relying on theory and methods derived from judgment research, the               project will identify the critical elements that affect scientific              judgment about the greenhouse effect.  Scientists involved in                   greenhouse research will be surveyed, and specific \"points of view\"             in the scientific community will be identified.  Follow-up                      interviews of proponents of the various points of view will probe               reasons for disagreements in critical areas.  The description of                scientific uncertainty and disagreement that is communicated to                 policy makers by normal channels will be compared with the results              of this study.  The study will result in an improved understanding              of the roots of scientific disagreement about the greenhouse                    effect.",
