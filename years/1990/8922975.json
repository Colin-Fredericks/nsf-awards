 "awd_abstract_narration": "Determining the seasonal patterns of fish reproduction in                       tropical lakes, and the processes that regulate mating and                      parental behavior, is fundamental to understanding natural fish                 communities and to the management and conservation of these                     diverse groups of animals.  Dr. McKaye will observe the changing                seasonal behavioral patterns of cichlid fishes in Lake Jiloa,                   Nicaragua, through direct underwater observations and use of                    remote video equipment.  This study has five main objectives:                   (1)  Long-term continuous monitoring and quantification of                      territory formation and breeding patterns of these fishes; (2)                  determining adult fish movements and number of times they breed                 in a three-year period by means of an intensive tagging program;                (3) experimental manipulation of the community by removing the                  presumed competitive dominant to determine if other species will                alter their breeding patterns in its absence; (4) quantifying the               behavioral patterns among species and sexes in the defense of                   young throughout the brooding period; (5) determining the                       frequency of inter- and intra-species adoptions by cichlid fishes               and the behavior patterns causing these adoptions to occur.  The                data collected, besides being important in answering behavioral                 questions about reproductive seasonality, will play a major role                in conserving one of the world's most evolutionarily interesting                groups of fishes.",
