 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the key theoretical debates over the role of law in society              is under what conditions and how does law shape political                       domination or resistance.  The variables that may affect the                    influence of legality on political conflict are many and must take              into account historical, cultural, moral, economic, social, and                 ideological forces as well as political forces.  There exists                   little empirical research that adequately addresses the issue, in               part because to do so requires a setting where the political and                legal frameworks are unstable.                                                                                                                                  This study will explore the circumstances under which legality does             or does not shape domination and resistance in South Africa, and,               when it does, the nature and consequences of that influence.  In                the struggle against apartheid, law has been a central battleground             between the South African regime and its opponents.  Drawing                    hypotheses from social science and social theory, Dr. Abel will                 examine the circumstances under which each party chooses or avoids              legal norms and institutions and will analyze the consequences of               those choices for the transformation of the dispute and its                     ultimate outcome.  Discrete cases will be studied in different                  substantive areas where either the state or the anti-apartheid                  movement either uses or avoids law.  Data will be drawn from                    lawyers' files and in-depth interviews with lawyers, parties, and               judges.                                                                                                                                                         This research promises to be pathbreaking in advancing our                      understanding of the role of law in political conflict and                      political movements in general and on the role of law in South                  Africa in particular.  The field research in South Africa will                  provide an opportunity to learn about a crucial issue in a society              whose transitional condition affords the ideal setting for such an              analysis.  Both parties to the struggle recognize that the role of              law will profoundly shape the nature of legality in post-apartheid              South Africa.  The study will present a creative framework that                 will elucidate the conditions and substantive legal areas in which              the state or opposition avoids or opts for law.  Thus, this                     research will chart the course for much subsequent work on this                 topic in the future.",
