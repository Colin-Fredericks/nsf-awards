 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research Experiences for Undergraduates project, six               students will work with faculty advisors relating advances in                   computational technology to mathematical research.  The emphasis                of the work will be on computational aspects of two areas: group                theory and dynamics.  Following initial orientation, students                   will break up into teams, concentrating on one of the two themes.               The interplay between experimentation and theory will enable the                students to deal, at an early stage, with complicated examples                  which cannot be done by hand.  These will lead to a better                      understanding of groups, dynamical systems and their underlying                 structure.                                                                           Students concentrating on group theory will be introduced to               fundamental concepts of computational group theory through                      permutation groups and exposure to CAYLEY and other programming                 languages capable of symbolic manipulation.  Dynamical systems                  will build on students' basic courses in calculus and linear                    algebra to investigate properties of orbits such as period                      doubling and saddle node bifurcations, Mandelbrot sets and the                  generation of fractal images using iterated functions systems.                  As the students become more familiar with computer                              experimentation, they will be exposed to problem areas and                      unsolved problems on which they will focus their attention for                  the remainder of the activity.                                                       Interspersed with the research program will be an evening                  lecture series in the sciences, history and literature.",
