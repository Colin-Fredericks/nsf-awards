 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a one year summer program which will take place in                      the summer of 1990 and which is being sponsored by the                          University of Northern Colorado.  Its principal goal is to                      teach 30 high school science teachers teaching strategies                       based on results of cognitive science research and to use                       these teaching strategies to teach courses which integrate                      science, technology and societal issues (STS).  The target                      group for this project are mainly teachers who teach non-                       science oriented students who, however, will need to                            understand some science in order to become informed citizens.                   The four week workshop for teachers selected from around the                    nation will, (a) provide science content in earth science, life                 science and physical science, (b) introduce and provide                         laboratory experiences for an STS curriculum, (c) enable                        teachers to design their own classroom activities relating to                   the local STS issues in their communities and (d) introduce                     the science teachers to the principles of cognitive science                     and to teaching strategies which have been shown to be                          effective by cognitive science research.  The NSF portion of                    the project, $154,982, will be matched with $16,750 from the                    University of Northern Colorado and the participating                           schools.  This is a cost share of about 11%.",
