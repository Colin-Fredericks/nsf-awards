 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cellular adaptation to high salinity by plant cells can be reversible,          indicating that the regulated expression of specific genes is                   controlling this adaptation.  The osmotin gene is one of the most               thoroughly studied genes that have altered expression during exposure           of adaptation to NaCl.  The overall objective of this research is to            better characterize the structure and function of the osmotin gene.             Gene transfer studies will be used to determine the specific                    physiological role of osmotin in adaptation to NaCl.  Molecular                 techniques will also be used to examine the regulatory structure of the         osmotin gene to determine the mechanisms that control its expression            under natural conditions.  Specifically, cis-acting DNA sequences and a         transacting factor will be examined.                                                                                                                            Salinity stress is an important constraint on agricultural production,          particularly in irrigated systems.  The long term goal of this research         is to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the process of                cellular adaptation to salt by examining specific genes expressed               during adaptation.  Understanding of the regulatory properties of such          genes will eventually lead to understanding how to manipulate salt              tolerance in plants, including important crop species.",
