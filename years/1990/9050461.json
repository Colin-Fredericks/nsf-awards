 "awd_abstract_narration": "New equipment is improving the student learning experience in                   physiology-oriented laboratory sections in a number of biology                  courses, by providing the opportunity to experiment in areas of                 contemporary biology.  Equipment that is \"user friendly\" and                    provides rapid set-up and response time permits new experiments                 to be performed in limited time constraints.  A refrigerated                    centrifuge and oxygen monitoring system provide for experiments                 on the photosynthetic response of isolated chloroplasts and the                 respiratory response of isolated mitochondria, ranging from basic               analyses in introductory courses to more advanced studies in                    plant physiology and biochemistry.  The oxygen monitoring system                also allows for the exploration of the respiratory response of                  aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms as a bioassay in a                     variety of experiments in ecology and microbiology courses.  The                equipment is used in a large variety of applications in different               courses, and affects many students.  The equipment also allows                  students to do more experimentation in independent research                     projects.  The college will contribute an amount equal to the                   award.",
