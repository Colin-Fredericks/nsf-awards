 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a gas chromatograph and infrared                             spectrophotometer has provided both first and second-year                       chemistry students with new experiences in instrumental analysis.               Concepts that previously were addressed through computer                        laboratory simulation are now incorporated into specific                        laboratory experiments.  Students in organic chemistry are first                introduced to gas chromatography as they separate a mixture of 2-               propanol and cyclohexane mixture; subsequently they analyze a                   product mixture after halogenation of an alkylbenzene.  Finally                 both of the instruments are used in the characterization of a                   product after its prior isolation, and in updating the                          qualitative organic analysis experience as instrumental methods                 supplant or complement wet methods.                                                                                                                             A GC experiment involving the identification of the                             transesterified fatty acids derived from common cooking oils has                been added to the laboratory of the Principles of Chemistry -                   Organic & Biochemistry sequence to complement experiments that                  demonstrate three other major chromatographic techniques.  Highly               motivated students in the General Chemistry I-II sequence use the               instruments as they choose a special laboratory experiment to                   carry out as they complete their final semester of the sequence.                                                                                                The institution has contributed to the project an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
