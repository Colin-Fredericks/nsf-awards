 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dystonia, the lack of muscle control with loss of muscle strength               indicates a neural deficit. The question is where in the brain is               the deficit? A useful model for studying dystonia is a genetic                  mutant rat ,the dt rat. The disorder in this mutant does not                    appear until the second week after birth and its neuronal                       morphology appears to be normal. To get a handle on the deficit                 the investigator has used harmaline a drug known to cause tremor                inthe second week after birth and to act specifically on a neural               circuit in the brainstem, the IO-Cerebellar circuit. Dt rats do                 not respond to haramline even during the first weeks of life.                   This to be used as a clue for investigating the physiological                   deficit in the dt rat. Harmaline will be administered in infant                 rats and the whole circuit tested to see if one or all synaptic                 linkages in the IO pathway are the source of the dystonia. The                  novel idea of using harmaline which has been well                               characterized,provides a pharmacological instrument for analysing               a specific neural system involved in motor movement.",
