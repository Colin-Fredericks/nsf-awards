 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although invertebrates comprise more than 95% of all animal                     species, there has been little study of their learning.  To                     remedy this deficiency, Dr. Bitterman has been investigating how                honey bees learn.  The honey bee is a highly-evolved                            invertebrate, with sensory, motor, and motivational properties                  that are unusually well suited to the purpose.  The experiments                 are done primarily with foragers coming of their own accord from                nearby hives to laboratory window sills, where they work for                    concentrated sugar solution, a reward they strongly prefer to the               nectar of flowers in the field.                                                                                                                                 The experiments show a wide range of similarities in the way in                 which honey bees and vertebrates store and use information                      acquired in the course of their experience, similarities that are               surprising in view of the remoteness of common ancestry and the                 vast differences in brain size and structure as well as in                      ecology.  As the project continues, some of the critical                        similarities are being probed more deeply to examine the                        possibility that they may be only superficial, and the scope of                 the comparison is being extended in a variety of new experiments.               The hypothesis suggested by the data already in hand is that the                evolution of intelligence has been governed by adaptive                         constraints much broader than usually conceived, and in good                    measure perhaps even by a logic of its own.",
