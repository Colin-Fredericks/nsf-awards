 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blind adaptive equalizers are key receiver components in high                   performance, high density, digital communications systems.  In less than        fifteen years since the conception of blind adaptive equalization,              various algorithms, frequently tailored to a particular source                  constellation class, have been proposed, implemented, tested and                installed.                                                                                                                                                      Convergence, despite an arbitrarily poor initialization, to a                   parameterization with nearly optimum achievable performance is a                seemingly desirable attribute of an acceptable blind adaptive equalizer         algorithm, or of any parameter adaptive system for that matter.                 Apparently no blind adaptive algorithm for a finite-impulse-response            equalizer is known to exist that can promise this, even for an idealized        situation with perfect recovery capability and the simplest digital             source of plus and minus ones.  yet, no theorem proves that such a              globally convergent algorithm does not exist, even in an idealized              setting.  Indeed, the available literature pertinent to this issue              leaves a mixed impression due to some (seemingly) contradictory claims.                                                                                         The research addresses this existence question, at least among the class        of schemes with memoryless error functions which subsumes the most              popular blind adaptive equalizers currently in use.  Within the                 proscribed class of applications and algorithms that do not posses              admissibility (i.e., global asymptotic optimality), the severity of the         practical consequences of this inadmissibility will be investigated by          examining the geometry of the associated error surface.  For schemes            lacking global asymptotic optimality, the utility of equalizer parameter        initialization schemes will also be investigated.  Finally, the                 potential for admissibility of \"new\" schemes that are outside the class         established which lacks global asymptotic optimality will be                    investigated, e.g., adaptive algorithms that utilize error functions            with memory.",
