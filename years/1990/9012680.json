 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technologies, especially computer-based assistive technologies,                 hold promise of enabling people with disabilities to participate                more and more effectively in social life.  Realization of this                  promise depends upon the development of appropriate policies as                 well.  This conference will address the range of issues -- ethical,             social, economic and technical -- necessary to fashioning effective             disability technology policies.  The approach is to identify these              issues through a structured discussion involving leading disability             and technology scholars and practitioners and then to expand the                discussion to involve \"grass roots\" service providers, consumers,               and activists.  The first day of the conference is devoted to                   presentation of papers and discussion among the small group of                  invited partipants.  On the second day, the workshop will merge                 with the annual conference of the Resource Center for Independent               Living in Utica.  RCIL is a member of the National Special                      Education Alliance and an important provider of services for                    disabled persons in New York State.  Funds from NSF will be used                to support some administrative and organizational conference costs,             as well as the participation of eleven invited scholars and                     practitioners.  Results will be widely disseminated in appropriate              journals and professional meetings.  Efforts will continue after                the conference, through the Project on Disability Technology Policy             of the SUNY Institute of Technology.                                                                                                                            This proposal is a modest request for support to enable leading                 scholars and practitioners to begin to address more deeply and                  directly issues of equity and access to technologies for disabled               persons.  The principal investigators and project associates are                well qualified; institutional support is very good; the conference              plans are good and integrated appropriately with related                        activities; dissemination is likely to be broad and to reach a wide             range of audiences.  Support is highly recommended.",
