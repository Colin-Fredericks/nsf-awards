 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) located on the                   U.S.-Mexico border has in the Fall of 1989, a student body                      comprised of 55.4% Hispanic, 33.3% Anglo, 3% Black, and 1.7%                    other minorities.  It's Computer Science Department is CSAB                     accredited. There were 239 undergraduates (53% Hispanic) and 48                 graduate students (25% Hispanic) enrolled in 1989.  Computer                    science enrollments, unlike the national trend, have been                       increasing over the last several years.                                              The primary goal of the project is to upgrade the quality of               education offered their predominantly minority student body.  To                accomplish this they must:                                                           o  Attract and retain students, particularly minority                      students, through improved instructional support and outreach                   activities                                                                           o   Encourage and prepare their most talented students to                  pursue graduate education either at UTEP or elsewhere                                o  Enhance and support the research productivity of the                    faculty.                                                                             An outstanding feature of their plan is the involvement of                 upper division and graduate student assistants.  Each student                   assistant will be directly involved in both teaching and                        research.  The use of student assistants provides many benefits,                particularly in the educational program.                                             Pipeline Activities: One of their major thrusts in computer                science is to increase the number of minority students intending                to major in computer science.  They will accomplish this by                     career development support in area middle and high schools,                     summer workshops designed to teach teachers how to teach computer               science and pre-college summer programs to introduce students to                science, engineering and computer science.                                           Recitation sections: The core of their plan is the use of                  student assistants which will enable them to break up large                     introductory classes into two components.  The beginning courses                will consist of large, professor led lecture sections twice                     weekly and much smaller (10-15 students) student assistant led                  recitation sections thrice weekly.  The student assistants will                 be trained in handling the recitation sections.  Such training                  will include teambuilding and leadership skills and knowing how                 to recognize problems as they develop.  They will also receive                  support and counselling on how to solve these problems.                              Role models: The student assistant leaders will also serve                 as role models for the low division students.  They will                        encourage the assistants to discuss their research work in these                recitation sections.                                                                 Curriculum development:  They plan to deal with the                        deficiencies in their curriculum coverage by encouraging faculty                to develop expertise in new areas of teaching and research.  A                  second major curriculum development strategy is to re-orient                    courses in order to fit the new ACM-Denning action-oriented model               of computer science education and the newly emerging ACM                        Curriculum 1990 guidelines which argue that laboratory work                     should include exercises in which students modify and explore                   existing codes.                                                                                                                                                      UTEP will upgrade the research productivity of the faculty                 through the avenues of technical expertise, student assistants,                 and the acquisition of sufficient equipment, including a network                of workstations, and necessary software.                                             These activities will maximize the number of Hispanic                      students who will choose to pursue advanced degrees and enter the               educational or research systems as their career choice.",
