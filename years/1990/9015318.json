Concurrent engineering has been defined as a systematic                    approach to the integrated design of products and their related                 processes.  Engineers utilizing concurrent design techniques                    consider all strategic elements of the product life cycle from                  conception through disposal.                                                         Concurrent engineering design is a particularly timely                     subject for an international workshop because of its implications               for increasing the competitiveness of U.S. industry.  Concurrent                design leads to shortened lead times in introducing producible                  and maintainable products and reduced total costs of doing                      business.",
