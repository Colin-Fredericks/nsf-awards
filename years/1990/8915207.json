It will focus on specific polymer systems:                           1) High-quality materials with relatively high molecular weight                 which are chain aligned and have relatively high crystallinity in               the solid state; examples include polyaniline, PPV (and its                     derivatives), and PTV.  2) Polymers which are processible either                as conjugated systems from solution or in precursor form from                   solution (or both, as in the case of the substituted PPV).                                                                                                           The research includes the following:  dilute one-dimensional               chains of polyaniline in solution: small-angle Neutron scattering               from Polyaniline in solution in sulfuric acid:  molecular-weight                dependences of the electronic properties of polyaniline:  ESR                   measurements of PPV (and derivatives) to monitor conversion from                prepolymer to conjugated polymer:  electronic and optical                       Properties of molten conjugated polymers; ESR Studies of polarons               and bipolarons in high-quality polymers with a nondegenerate                    ground state; polarons and bipolarons in dihexyloxy-PPV in                      solution; determination of whether or not heavily doped PPV (and                derivatives) and PTV are true metals; forced Rayleigh scattering                by conjugated polymers in solution; and crystal structures and                  chain packing in highly ordered conducting polymers.",
