 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of the rapid expansion of                      supercritical solutions (RESS) as a means of producing                          monodisperse polymer microspheres and of incorporating low                      molecular weight compounds into the polymer matrix.  Polymers                   studied include polylactic and polyglycolic acids and their                     copolymers, polystyrene, and polymethacrylates.  Low molecular                                                                                                  weight co-precipitates studied include the model compounds                      naphthalene and phenanthrene, as well as progesterone, a                        contraceptive steroid.  The mathematical modeling of the RESS                   process constitutes the theoretical component of this project.                                                                                                  The goal is to understand quantitatively how process variables                                                                                                  influence the size distribution of RESS powders.                                                                                                                Precipitation in RESS occurs as a result of a sudden expansion                                                                                                  which propagates at the speed of sound.  This leads to                          essentially uniform supersaturation in the nucleating medium,                   giving rise to particles with narrow size distributions.  The                   nonideality of supercritical solutions gives rise to                            exceptionally high supersaturation ratios upon expansion, and                   hence to very small particles.  To date, the idea of applying                   this novel process to the  production of polymer microspheres                   for sustained drug release, combining into one step particle                    production, low molecular weight drug incorporation and size                    reduction has not been explored.  No quantitative treatment of                                                                                                  the RESS process exists to date.  The proposed model accounts                   for nonidealities peculiar to supercritical mixtures, such as                   endothermic solute condensation, and high solvent                               compressibility.                                                                                                                                                Polymer microspheres are used as chromatography packings,                       calibration standards, and sustained drug delivery devices.                     Problems associated with current methods for the production of                                                                                                  polymeric microsphere powders include the need for solvent and                                                                                                  surfactant elimination, poor control of particle size                           distribution, and, for drug delivery applications, the                          difficulty of incorporating drugs into the carrier particles                    uniformly and at high concentration.  For micron or sub-micron                                                                                                  particles, which can be made monodisperse but are colloidally                   stable, purification and drying are especially difficult                        steps.                                                                          The RESS process has the potential for unifying particle                        production, incorporation of low molecular weight drugs,                        purification, and size reduction in a single step leading to                    solvent-free microspheres with a narrow size distribution.                      The resulting reduction in sample loss and contamination is                     especially important in drug delivery applications.",
