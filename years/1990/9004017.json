 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project consists of two parts, both trying to                study knot (link) invariants via representation varieties.  The                 first part is a continuation of Lin's work wherein he defined a                 knot invariant in terms of an intersection number of subvarieties               and related this knot invariant to a classical one.  To                         generalize this work, one can define other intersection numbers                 and he is interested in relating these intersection numbers with                classical link invariants.  In the second part, he suggests a way               of constructing a 2-variable polynomial for a knot in S3,                       generalizing the definition of the Alexander polynomial via                     Seifert forms.  This construction is intimately related to                      representation varieties.  In particular, it suggests a possible                connection between the Jones polynomial and Casson's invariant of               homology 3-spheres.  Lin's hope is that this research will shed                 some light on some important questions, such as how to generalize               the Jones polynomial from S3 to arbitrary 3-manifolds and how to                interpret the Jones polynomial in terms of the topology of the                  knot complement.                                                                     Knots in three-dimensional space are natural objects to                    study.  The polynomials Lin describes reduce the problem of                     distinguishing truly inequivalent knots from different                          presentations of the same knot to questions about polynomials,                  i.e. to fairly simple algebraic problems.  (This transition from                geometry to algebra turns out to be related to other mathematics                of no immediately apparent connection.)",
