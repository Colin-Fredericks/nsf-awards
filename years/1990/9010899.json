 "awd_abstract_narration": "Selective visual attention serializes the processing of stimulus                data to make efficient use of limited processing resources in the               human visual system.  This work will develop a connectionist                    network to emulate a variety of attentional phenomena that have                 been reported by Treisman, Wolford, Duncan and others.  As                      demonstrated in preliminary work, a hierarchical, multi-scale                   network that uses feature arrays with strong lateral inhibitory                 connections is capable of producing responses that are suggestive               of a number of key behaviors associated with visual attention.                  The work to be done involves integrating the network structures                 of the earlier work into a single cohesive architecture,                        elaborating this network model to support additional function,                  and tuning the network structure to provide a more quantitative                 match with behavioral and neural data.  The goals of the work are               to provide (1) a practical computational model for machine                      recognition systems, (2) a model of human visual attention that                 is more comprehensive than current theories, and (3) a network                  model that makes contact with data on the neural basis of                       attention.",
