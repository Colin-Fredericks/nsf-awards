 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1987, Dr. Susan Pollock conducted a first season of fieldwork                at the Iraqi site of Abu Salabikh.  Dated to the Uruk period,                   this mound site contains the remains of an early Mesopotamian                   town and documents the emergence of a state level of organization               in this region.  Using a combination of methods, the nature and                 distribution of materials across the site was determined and                    existing ceramic chronologies refined to provide tight temporal                 control.  Because of the amount and variety of materials the site               contains and the presence of buried domestic structures, further                work is desirable, and funds provided by the National Science                   Foundation will permit an additional two field seasons of                       excavation and analysis.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Pollock and her collaborators will continue their surface                   survey to determine lateral distribution of materials.  Scraping                - removal of enough overburden to expose structure outlines -                   will reveal the location of habitation areas and permit careful                 excavation of a series of individual structures.  Analyses of                   ceramics and other remains, such as stone tools and seal                        impressions, will provide insight into daily family activities.                 It will also allow comparisons across different social groupings                and, on this basis, a determination of socio-economic                           differentiation.                                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                a unique insight into how complex societies arise.  Because Abu                 Salabikh is not deeply buried and dates to a limited time period,               it provides an excellent opportunity to undertake the kind of                   social reconstruction which Dr. Pollock proposes.  While                        archaeologists have hypothesized on the factors which led to the                rise of states in the Near East, this has been done primarily on                a grand socio-political scale and very few researchers have                     focussed their attentions on the family level.  Thus, this                      project both corrects an imbalance and provides data of wide                    general interest.  Because students are included in the project,                it will also contribute to the training of future scientists.  It               should, in a small way, help to strengthen the developing                       scientific ties between the United States and Iraq.",
