This                  undergraduate Experimental Biochemistry course will focus on                    enzymology and molecular biology using a cloned full-length cDNA                of Drosophila melanogaster alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to provide               experimental materials.  ADH will be purified from E. coli carrying             the ADHcDNA cloned in an expression vector.  The purified enzyme                will be analyzed to determine the Km values for primary and                     secondary alcohols and the Ki values for competitive and non-                   competitive inhibitors.  Purified ADH will be reversibly                        inactivated and reactivated through thio-disulfide interconversion.             Effects of Nonsense, Missense and Deletion mutations will be                    examined by comparing ADH activity and antigenic response in the                lysates of E. coli carrying the mutated ADHcDNAs.  The ADH insert               in M13 phage will be used to teach restriction mapping and DNA                  sequencing techniques.  The principles of nucleic acid chemistry                will be illustrated by determining the sequences of di- and tri-                ribonucleotides with ribonuclease digestions, chromatography and                UV spectra of the products under acidic, neutral and basic                      conditions.  Denaturation of doubly-stranded DNA will be examined.              Computer analysis and application are emphasized in appropriate                 experiments.  The grantee is matching with award with non-Federal               sources.",
