 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Science Department of the University of Colorado will              continue to develop the infrastructure created with their prior CER             award by upgrading workstations, adding X terminals, and acquiring new          shared-memory and distributed memory multiprocessors.  This will                enable researchers in the department to continue their significant              investigations in the areas of scientific computation, connectionist            systems, and software systems.  The research in scientific computation          has three components:  language and tools, numerical algorithms, and            applications, which all have a heavy emphasis on parallel computation.          Parallel computation is also emphasized by the connectionist                    researchers, who are making interesting applications of connectionism           and are collaborating with the scientific computation researchers in            developing sophisticated optimization algorithms.  The software                 systems research has a broad scope, including projects in user                  interfaces, databases, programming environments, distributed systems,           and languages and semantics.  The systems researchers provide a basic           source of systems expertise and tools for the other research areas, as          well as engaging in fundamental systems investigations.",
