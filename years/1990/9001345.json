 "awd_abstract_narration": "The life cycle of freshwater unionid mussels is atypical                   among bivalves and involves both a free-living adult and a                      parasitic larva, the glochidium.  Following fertilization,                      developing embryos are incubated in the water tubes of the                      mother's gills where they may remain for several months before                  being released into the water column and becoming parasitic on                  fish.                                                                                The principal objective of this study is to assess the                     morphological and physiological changes that occur within the                   gills of brooding female Anodonta cataracta, an abundant                        freshwater mussel in North Carolina.  During brooding, two of the               mussel's four gills become packed with nearly a million                         glochidia, causing the gills to swell to up to thirty times their               non-brooding size.  The major goals of the proposed research                    include quantifying the morphological changes that occur within                 the marsupial gills, comparing the pumping and filtration                       dynamics of brooding and non-brooding mussels, determining the                  effect of brooding on oxygen uptake and oxygen extraction                       efficiency of mussels, and assessing the activity of the cilia                  responsible for irrigation both the marsupial and non-marsupial                 gills.  The results will provide a more complete understanding of               the reproductive biology of A. cataracta, especially the effect                 of glochidial brooding and release on the physiology and gill                   morphology of adult females.  This information also may have                    application for the management and conservation of other                        freshwater bivalves including threatened and endangered species.",
