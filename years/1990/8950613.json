 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two semester sophomore engineering laboratory, \"Introduction to               Experimentation\", is computer integrated.  Each of 24 experimental              stations will be equipped with a network computer and integrated                word processor, spreadsheet, database, and graphics software.                   The computer is interfaced to a digital multimeter.  Current                    experiments are performed by the student using the spreadsheet and the          word processor for all data analysis, graphics, and lab report                  production.  The campus network provides data transfer and                      printing on a local laser print server.  In addition, data                      acquisition of electrical signals are computerized, using the                   multimeters and  digital oscilloscopes.  This lab improvement                   update is an important addition to the curriculum because the                   computer engineering and technology tools that are currently used               professionally must be included in a modern curriculum.  In                     addition to being a significant advance toward that goal, the                   laboratory improvement provides a platform for further                          implementation of computer assisted experimentation.  This lab is               taken by all engineering and science sophomores, so that it has                 the widest possible exposure, and in addition, it supplies a base               of student expertise that can be built upon in the following two                years.",
