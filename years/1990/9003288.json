 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project treats algebraic (and analytic) actions on                    affine varieties from the viewpoint of smooth (differentiable)                  transformation groups.  The subject of smooth transformation                    groups has been strongly influenced by the following two central                problems:  LINEARITY PROBLEM.  Which groups act nonlinearly on                  affine space of some dimension?  (An action is linear if it is                  conjugate to an action defined by a representation of the group.)               FIXED POINT PROBLEM.  Which groups act without fixed points on                  affine space of some dimension?  The tools used to settle these                 problems and the further problems they generated have been                      important themes in the field of smooth transformation groups.                  During the last few years researchers from algebraic                            transformation groups as well as those from smooth transformation               groups have recognized the importance of these two questions in                 the algebraic category, and in that case the groups dealt with                  should be reductive (which includes as a special case the finite                groups).  Petrie will continue his work in this direction,                      bringing topological methods to bear on algebraic questions.",
