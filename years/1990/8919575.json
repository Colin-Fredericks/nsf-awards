 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objectives of this proposal are to detail the                     molecular mechanisms regulating transcription and replication of                vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and its defective interfering                  particles (DI).  This prototype negative-strand rhabdovirus is                  readily grown in large quantities and is an excellent model system              for numerous other disease-causing viruses as well as basic                     mechanisms of cellular gene expression.  Only three virion-                     associated proteins (L polymerase, NS transcription factor, and                 nucleocapsid N protein) are sufficient to carry out a complex                   genome transcription process in vitro.  NS is regulated by                      phosphorylation and contains an acidic activating domain which                  probably functions like that found in many eukaryotic cellular                  transcription factors.  We plan to purify the virion-associated                 protein kinase(s) responsible for activating VSV transcription.                 Specific NS protein domain II substrates will be prepared to                    monitor this purification.  The physical and biochemical properties             of this purified kinase will be examined to shed light on the                   question of whether this activity is encoded by the virus or host               genome.                                                                                                                                                         Basic studies of viral genetics such as this one not only provide               an understanding of how viruses grows and develop but also provide              information about generalized genetic functions in animal cells.",
