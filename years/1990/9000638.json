 "awd_abstract_narration": "SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a multi-week,                university-level research experience focused on modern                          geophysical exploration.  In 6 years of operation since 1983, 163               undergraduate students (including 33 women) have participated in                research using seismic reflection and refraction, gravity,                      magnetics, electrical resistivity, electromagnetics, and                        magnetotellurics.  The SAGE field area in the Rio Grande rift                   near Sante Fe, New Mexico provides a stimulating tectonic                       research environment as well as an opportunity to study                         occurrences of groundwater and hydrocarbons.  SAGE students                     participate in every phase of the field research from the                       collection and processing of data to its interpretation                         culminating with both an oral and written report.  SAGE research                is now focused on characterizing a classic rift accommodation                   zone.  SAGE is sponsored by the Los Alamos National Laboratory                  (LANL) Branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary                      Physics of the University of California and six universities who                furnish faculty and over $2,000,000 worth of geophysical                        equipment.  Students are accepted from any school.  There is                    enthusiastic support from industry; for example, ARCO Oil and Gas               Company donated an entire Vibroseis crew to the SAGE 89 effort.",
