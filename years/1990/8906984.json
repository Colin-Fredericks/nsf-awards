 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intracellular accumulation of polypeptide chains from cloned                genes as non native aggregates - inclusion bodies- has emerged as               a problem in biotechnology.  One of the few systems for which                   intracellular intermediates in polypeptide chain folding and                    aggregation have been identified is the thermostable trimeric                   tailspike of bacteriophage P22.  Mutations which interfere with                 intermediates in the folding pathway, rather than the native                    protein, map at over 30 sites in the central region of the                      polypeptide chain.  Use of these mutants has revealed that the                  inclusion bodies form from an early single chain intermediate in                the intracellular folding pathway.  Second site suppressors have                been isolated which alleviate the tsf folding defects.                          Suppressors at two nearby sites within the gene appear to act by                inhibiting the aggregation pathway.  They do not affect the                     biological activity of the protein once correctly folded.  This                 suggests that the role of some local sequences in the chain is to               block off-pathway reactions rather than to stabilize the native                 protein.  Such amino acid sequence information could be of                      practical significance in the recovery of cloned proteins and of                theoretical significance in deciphering the rules through which                 amino acid sequences encode protein conformation.  This proposal                focuses on elucidating the mechanism of action of the second site               suppressors by preparing urea denatured forms of the purified                   tsf, sutsf,  tsf / sutsf and wild type proteins and comparing                   their refolding in vitro.  These experiments will define whether                the suppressors act through intrachain interactions, or require                 interactions with cellular components such as chaperonins.",
