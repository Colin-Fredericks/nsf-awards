 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this project is to understand the                    molecular mechanisms that control secretion of insulin from the                 pancreatic B-cell.  These mechanisms are complex, and quantitative              theoretical methods, including the kinetic-molecular theory of                  nonequilibrium thermodynamics, will be used to formulate the                    appropriate mathematical description.  Our approach is based on                 experimental schemes of molecular processes involved in insulin                 granule formation, Ca2+ handling, phosphorylation, and insulin                  granule exocytosis.  Translating these schemes into elementary                  processes, and thence into rate equations, we will explore the                  effect of the following mechanisms on rate of insulin release:                  1) Complex electrical activity of the plasma membrane related to                Ca2+ and pH;  2) electrical coupling between B-cells in islets;                 3) Ca2+ handling mechanisms;  4) phospholipid-based biochemical                 mechanisms involved in the control of insulin secretion.  These                 mechanisms will be explored using mathematical analysis and                     computer simulations of the corresponding ordinary differential                 equations.  Sufficient experimental information regarding the rates             of the processes is available to justify these calculations, which              will be interfaced closely with ongoing experimental work.  The                 work will provide insight into the cellular-molecular mechanisms                involved in type II (noninsulin dependent) diabetes.  More                      generally, this work will help provide a basis for a theoretical                cell biology and cell physiology.  The complexity of the cell                   requires a good analytical foundation to complement experimental                studies in order to develop a good theoretical basis for                        understanding the mechanism of cellular function.",
