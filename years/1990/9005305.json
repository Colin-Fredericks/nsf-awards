 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two year collaborative research project                               between B. Clark Burchfiel of Massachusetts                                     Institute of Technology and Chen Jichen of the                                  Yunnan Institute of Geological Sciences, Chinese                                Academy of Sciences.  The project is sponsored                                  jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                             This is the first phase of a projected four year                                study on Cenozoic and active deformation in the                                 Tonghai.Jianshui.Kunming region of Yunnan Province.                             The immediate goal is to document the Cenozoic                                  deformation history of an area adjacent to the                                  eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau, which is                                 related to the tectonic development of the plateau                              and surrounding regions of China.  The broadest aim                             of the project is to develop a better understanding                             of the nature of intracontinental deformation in                                Tibet, China and southeast Asia.                                                                                                                                Tibet is the most spectacular example of active                                 continental collision on earth, and deformation                                 within Tibet is commonly assumed to provide a model                             for convergent intracontinental deformation.                                    However, there is little field data available for                               Tibet and a wide range of hypotheses have been                                  proposed to explain its Cenozoic deformation.                                   These various hypotheses have different .. and                                  testable .. implications for deformation along and                              adjacent to the eastern margin of Tibet, so that                                they may perhaps be most efficiently tested by                                  geological studies along the eastern margin of the                              plateau.  The proposed study of the Tonghai region                              should provide a major addition to the sparse                                   observational data that document the Cenozoic and                               active deformation of Tibet and its environs.  The                              PI's will test their hypothesis that the thickened                              crust beneath the Tibetan plateau is the result of                              distributed north.south to northeast crustal                                    shortening within the plateau.",
