 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will accomplish three goals.  First,                 it will continue the Buell Succession Study (BSS) until at least                its 38th year.  Currently this study is one of the longest,                     temporally most complete studies of oldfield succession in North                America.  It consists of 11 fields, each containing 48 permanent                plots.  Sampling of species composition and cover has been                      conducted continuously since 1958 in the oldest fields.  The BSS                data are therefore unique in scope and density, but represent one               of the most universal processes in ecology.  Second, it will                    develop a data management system capable of accommodating new                   data from the BSS as it is collected.  A compact, tractable data                base will be produced.  This will encourage analysis and                        comparison.   Third, in order to ensure utility of the data base,               the data will be analyzed.  This exercise will serve as a check                 for refinement of the data base, and will test two key hypotheses               about succession.  The study will test predictions about                        community convergence and trends of spatial heterogeneity through               time.                                                                                The principal product of the work will be a reliable and                   flexible data base and the test of two critical problems in                     succession theory.  Once the data base is operational, other                    analyses can be undertaken in the future.  The study will                       ultimately be compared to the patterns derived from this                        succession with those in other long term studies, especially                    experimental ones.  Thus, by ensuring the survival and fruition                 of the longest and temporally densest study of oldfield                         succession in North America, a unique opportunity to resolve                    persistent problems in the area of community dynamics and to                    discover new patterns in succession will be possible.",
