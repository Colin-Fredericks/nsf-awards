 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quite possibly all stars pulsate, though in most stars the                      pulsations are so small and the stars are so distant that the                   pulsations are very difficult to detect.  For example, in the case              of the sun, pulsations have been detected only recently with newly              developed instrumentation, giving rise to the science of                        \"helioseismology.\"  Ther are, however, stars that pulsate rather                strongly.  These stars grow visibly brighter and dimmer, and they               expand and contract.  Some do so with rather regular periods, as                for example the Cepeheid and RR Lyra stars; others are quite                    erratic in their pulsations, such as the RV Tauri stars.                                                                                                        The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with his                   current NSF funded theoretical and numerical study of pulsating                 stars of all types, from Cepeheids and RR Lyra stars to Semi-                   Regulars and the RV Tauri stars.  The computing method will                     consist of a \"judicious mixture of semi-analytical amplitude                    equation formalism and of numerical hydrodynamics.\"  The goal will              be to develop one-parameter families of pulsating star models,                  rather than to study specific observed stars.                                                                                                                   In support of this study, the PI proposes to expand his current                 computer codes to make them more realistic and to interpret                     stellar pulsation in terms of chaos theory.",
