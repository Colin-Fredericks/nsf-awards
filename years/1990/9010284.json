 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing three-dimensional models of complex objects is                   important for many applications.  Unfortunately, the two-                       dimensional nature of displays makes visualization of complex                   three-dimensional objects difficult.  Observers are required to                 develop mental models of three-dimensional objects by integrating               visual information received from two-dimensional views which used               monocular depth cues as coding techniques.  A new display                       technology is currently available that provides the binocular depth             cue of stereopsis.  This cue may be advantageous when few monocular             cues are available in the image.                                                                                                                                The objective of the research is to investigate the relative merits             of monoscopic versus stereoscopic display techniques for presenting             visual representations of three-dimensional objects.  It is                     hypothesized that the effectiveness of both techniques will depend              upon object complexity and the number of monocular cues available.              The research will attempt to determine if a trade-off exists for                using stereoscopic versus monoscopic coding techniques using a                  mental  rotation paradigm.  Images will be created using the                    stereoscopic cue and a variety of monocular coding techniques                   including hidden line removal, shading, texture and rotation.  The              number of monocular cues available in an image will be varied.                  This empirical research will provide needed data on the use of                  stereoscopic displays as a tool for providing three-dimensional                 representations of objects, and provide insight as to whether                   stereoscopic displays are feasible alternatives to high cost                    graphic processing techniques.",
