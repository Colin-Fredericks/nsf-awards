 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. William              Hubbard, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona and              Drs. Andre Brahic and Bruno Sicardy, Observatory of Paris, Meudon,              France.  The objective of the project is a joint effort on the                  reduction and analysis of coordinated observations of stellar                   occultations by outer solar system bodies, particularly focusing                on Saturn and Neptune.  These studies will be used to derive new                results about the ring systems and the atmospheres of these                     objects, which will complement and expand the latest information                from Voyager encounters.  Based on results from the 1989 Neptune                encounter, the researchers will plan further coordinated observa-               tions of future occultation events, as well as theoretical                      investigations of ring dynamics and atmospheric structure related               to the observational data base.                                                                                                                                 The stellar occultation technique is used to probe the structure of             distant atmospheres and rings with a spatial resolution of a few                kilometers.  With the dearth of spacecraft observations of outer                system bodies following Voyager's Neptune encounter, it is                      particularly important to carry out this work.  Neptune's bizarre               ring-arcs were first identified by a collaborative effort of these              investigators, and the recent confirmation of these structures by               the Voyager research has emphasized the value of the proposed                   research.  Also, both groups were highly successful in obtaining                recent stellar occultation observations of Saturn's rings and                   atmosphere, involving a fifth magnitude star, which resulted in                 data of unusually high quality.  Furthermore, the Meudon group                  obtained the first stellar occultation probe of Saturn's satellite              Titan.  Because of the diversely located sites at which data are                obtained, it is important that these two groups have the continued              opportunity to work together closely.",
