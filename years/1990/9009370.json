 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new three terminal device, double                                       heterostructure optoelectronic thyristor                                        (DHOET), will be investigated for picosecond                                    high power switching and for generating short                                   laser pulse with high output power.  The                                        device is developed from concepts of Si                                         thyristors and double heterostructure (DH)                                      lasers and will be based on GaInAsP/InP                                         heterostructures grown by liquid phase                                          epitaxy.  While numerous research works have                                    been reported about Si based thyristors, little                                 has been done as A1GaAs/GaAs and no                                             work has been reported on GaInAsP/InP                                           based thyristors.  The main thrust of this                                      proposed study is to understand the effects of                                  band discontinuities ( Ec, Ev) on the turn-on                                   and turn-off speed of the proposed DHOETs                                       and to explore their unique features as                                         compared to Si thyristors including: (i) much                                   higher device speed, (ii) higher device                                         operating temperature, (iii) higher radiation                                   resistance, and (iv) excellent optical triggering                               sensitivity with InP as the optical window.                                           This research may open up a                                               practically important new research area of III-                                 V-DHOETs for the applications of high speed                                     pulsed power switching and the generation of                                    subnanosecond electrical and optical high                                       power pulses.  Research performed in this                                       project is expected to advance our                                              understanding of heterostructures and will                                      have many other important applications such                                     as the potential of fabricating novel optical                                   amplifiers.",
