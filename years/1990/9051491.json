 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wesleyan will initiate a new undergraduate program, Neuroscience                & Behavior in 1990/91.  Two of the three new courses for the                    program are the focus of this project.  The program is research                 oriented and a key goal is to have virtually all of the 20-25                   senior majors involved in independent research projects.  As                    preparation, sophomores will take a laboratory course wither in                 submammalian neurophysiology or in mammalian behavioral                         neurobiology.  We propose to obtain modern data acquisition,                    storage and analysis equipment for the behavioral neurobiology                  laboratory course.  The equipment will also provide demonstrations              in the introductory survey course, and make possible independent                research for advanced majors.  The equipment includes recording                 modules, an electrical stimulator, a video system, a computer                   workstation for analyzing physiological and behavioral data, and                an optical disk system for mass storage.  Experiments with animals              will involve the chemical and electrical initiation of locomotion,              and single neuron activity associated with head movement, spatial               cognition, and memory.  Experiments with human subjects will                    involve the preparation for locomotion, the generation of eye                   movements, and EEG and cardiac changes during learning.  Each year              the project will directly improve the training of 20 students in                the laboratory course and independent projects and benefit another              30 students through the demonstrations in the introductory course.",
