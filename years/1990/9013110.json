 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues to study coordination problems in                        experimental games.  It evaluates alternative theories of adaptive              behavior by studying the times series of past experiments on                    coordination games and through the design of new games.  It                     examines the ability of evolutionary stability and the genetic                  algorithm as well as individual learning models to explain the                  dynamics of play.  The project also studies the foundations of                  cooperation which pervade much of the prior work on experimental                coordination games.                                                                                                                                             This research has made and will continue to make an important                   contribution to economics.  Coordination games of the type studied              in this project have been used to test theories about                           underemployment equilibria in macroeconoimcs.  In industrial                    organization coordination problems occur in such areas of research              as standardization, the entry of new firms into an oligopolistic                industry, multi-agent incentive problems and network externalities.             The controlled laboratory experiments in this project provide one               of the only ways of testing the wide variety of selection and                   refinement criteria used by game theorists.",
