 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iodine occurs in seawater as iodate, iodide and organic iodine.                 Although iodine is the most abundant biophilic minor element                    and the distributions of its inorganic forms are known, direct                  evidence concerning the processes that may control its                          speciation is largely incomplete.  The uptake of dissolved                      iodine species and the accompanying reduction of iodate to                      iodide by marine organisms may be similar to and/or intertwined                 with the uptake of nitrogen species which is a major                            controlling factor of marine primary production.  Iodide is the                 most abundant inorganic reducing agent in surface seawater.                     The reactions between iodide and oxidizing trace species can                    have geochemically important implications on marine as well as                  global tropospheric chemistry.  The overall goal of this                        project is to understand and quantify the biological and                        biological processes that control the speciation of iodine in                   seawater and the interactions of the iodine system with other                   geochemically important species.  The investigation will (1)                    quantify the uptake of dissolved iodine species by                              phytoplankton, test the interactions between the iodine and                     nitrogen systems in the process and evaluate the possibility of                 using iodate as a convenient analog for studying nitrate                        uptake; and (2) quantify the reactions between iodide and                       hydrogen peroxide in seawater and estimate the importance of                    these reactions to the marine geochemistry of the iodine                        system.",
