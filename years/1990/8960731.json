 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of sensor technology.  The primary objective of this                   research project is research leading to proof of concept of a new               gas sensor technology based on the Kelvin method of electronic                  work function measurement.  The sensitivity of this technique to                adsorbed gases will be augmented by the use of a gold-film active               surface and elevated temperature operation to establish                         selectivity and extend the concentration limits of operation.                   Initially, a prototype sensor will be designed, built, and                      evaluated to determine the feasibility of the approach.  Hydrogen               sulfide will be used in the evaluation because of its importance                as an industrial toxin, its strong interaction with gold, and the               critical need for hydrogen sulfide sensors that continuously                    monitor wide ranges of concentration.                                                                                                                           The successful pursuit of this Phase I activity could lead to the               commercialization of a new class of compact, cost-effective gas                 sensors permitting a degree of control of sensitivity and                       selectivity heretofore not possible.  The potential flexibility of              this technology could enable the development of a broad array of                toxic industrial gas sensors that could penetrate significantly a               market which is currently dominated by foreign interests.",
