 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricane Hugo struck the coast of South Carolina just after               midnight on Friday, September 22, 1989.  The eye of the hurricane               came ashore just north of Charleston, SC and moved northward                    through the state to Charlotte, NC.  Hugo's landfall was near the               Baruch Institute's coastal field facility and the North Inlet                   Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.  The site received                   extensive storm damage and a tidal surge that was 4 meters above                mean high tide.                                                                      Salt marsh ecosystems and their adjacent coastal forests                   have evolved under a regime of gradually rising sea level.  A                   major hurricane such as Hugo may occur only 1-3 times per                       century.  And this kind of disturbance may trigger sudden                       expansion of marsh into forested areas.                                              To assess the short and long term effects of Hurricane Hugo,               researchers at the University of South Carolina will:                                                                                                           1.   Map the spatial distribution and elevation of the storm                         surge in the forested portion of the North Inlet ecosystem.                     And they will gather information on the storm surge height                      and the deposition of Spartina detritus (wrack) and marsh                       mud in the forest floor.                                                                                                                                   2.   Map ground water salinity in forest soils, changes in soil                      and ground water chemistry, and relate this information to                      tree mortality and other changes in vegetation.                                                                                                            3.   Establish study sites where decomposition of wrack and its                      effect on underlying soil can be studied.                                                                                                                  4.   Acquire low altitude, false-color infrared aerial                               photographs and multispectral Thematic Mapper (satellite)                       images to document geomorphic and botanical changes caused                      by Hugo.  Follow-up photographs and satellite imagery should                    be made several times during the next several years to                          detect changes and recovery of the ecosystem.                                                                                                                   Work on effects of large disturbances such as Hurricane Hugo               address important issues about the response, resilience, and                    recovery of complex coastal ecosystems. Information gathered by                 this research should provide data on mechanisms of salt marsh                   expansion and forest recession in response to salinity and wind                 stresses. And the work should provide valuable landscape level                  information on the response of the North Inlet LTER ecosystem to                a major disturbance.                                                            \f    Dr. Gardner is a very experienced and productive scientist                 who is well qualified to conduct and direct this research on the                impacts of Hurricane Hugo on the North Inlet ecosystem. He will                 be assisted by Co-Principal Investigators, Kjerfve, Blood,                      Michener, and Williams. Although the Baruch Institute's field                   facilities were destroyed by Hugo, field research has continued.                In particular, sampling transects and established piezometer                    networks facilitate the objectives of this research.  The                       University of South Carolina has excellent facilities to support                this research effort.",
