 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research considers a variety of interrelated topics of                      current interest in the econometric analysis of time series                     generated by dynamic economic relationships.                                                                                                                    The first area of research concerns the development and                         application of semiparametric and nonparametric methods for                     estimation, inference and prediction in dynamic models. Some of                 the work in this area will include extending existing models on                 business cycle duration dependence through the estimation of                    underlying hazard functions nonparametrically. Applications of                  nonparametric conditional mean estimation to the prediction of                  asset returns and macroeconomic aggregates will be made.                                                                                                        The second area of research deals with the development of                       nonlinear filtering procedures for the analysis of economic time                series generated by a variety of nonlinear models. Many examples                in economics, such as dividend payout behavior by liquidity                     constrained firms and estimation of information flow in financial               markets, do not fit into the easily-handled Gaussian framework.                 An optimal filter for such models will be developed and compared                to commonly used (but suboptimal) filters. Related work in                      investigating the usefulness of such filters in predicting                      business cycle turning points will also be performed.                                                                                                           The final area of research is concerned with the econometric                    implications of policy control of dynamic economic systems, the                 parameters of which are known only with considerable uncertainty.               The integration of Bayesian inference and optimal control theory                should provide insights into the econometric implications of the                tradeoff between optimizing policy and estimation. Initially,                   this issue will be studied through an analysis of the \"Laffer                   Curve\", which makes explicit the tradeoff between revenue                       maximization  in the near term and better information about the                 relation between tax rates and revenue obtained.",
