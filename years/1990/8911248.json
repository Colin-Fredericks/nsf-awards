 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lillian Hoddeson and Dr. Catherine Westfall are undertaking a               pilot study to explore the workings of \"big science\" in American                physics through a critical historical examination of the last 25                years of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), the                  base of the world's highest energy particle accelerator.  Their                 ultimate hope is to examine the effects of institutions like                    Fermilab on scientific research of increased size, scope, and                   cost of facilities and experiments; the changes in experimental                 research resulting from large working teams and long time-scales;               the influence of politics and government control, \"user\"                        orientation of facilities, geographical concentration and                       computerization.  Under this pilot study, they will produce an                  initial overall analysis of the major issues in the full-length                 project and three specific studies: (1) on the construction and                 early research program at Fermilab; (2) on the impact of the SSC;               and (3) on the history of the Collider-Detector Facility (CDF)                  \"experiment.\"  Dr. Hoddeson will focus on technical aspects of                  the designing of large accelerators and detectors, including the                400 GeV syncrotron, the 1000 GeV Tevatron, the CDF detector, and                the SSC, as well as the experimental program after 1980 and the                 impact on Fermilab and high energy physics of the SSC.  Dr.                     Westfall will deal more with the political and technical origins                of Fermilab, construction of the 400 GeV machine, the early                     experimental program (1971-80) and the establishment of the SSC.                This study should greatly enhance our understanding of the                      operation and impact of big science in physics today.",
