 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being supported by the Organic Synthesis                       Program.  Dr. Hegedus will continue his development of                          transition metal based reagents as highly selective synthetic                   tools.  The scientific significance of the research is that new                 chemical transformations of general use for organic synthesis                   will be developed, that new organic compounds with interesting                  physical, biological, and chemical properties will be produced,                 and that efficient synthetic approaches to a variety of                         heterocyclic and carbocyclic systems will be developed.                                                                                                         The overall objective of the research is to develop new                         synthetic methods using transition metal complexes to permit                    new modes of reactivity for organic functional groups.  This                    will be achieved by careful study of the fundamental chemistry                  of the metal-organic species involved, to permit the                            development of useful, new synthetic transformations.  The                      newly developed processes will be applied to the synthesis of                   complex molecules when possible.  Reactive organic                              intermediates such as electron-rich ketenes, chiral enamides,                   highly functionalized chiral quarternary centers, and                           \"push-pull\" allenes, will be made routinely accessible and                      usable for synthesis by generating them from metal complexes.                   The newly developed methodology will be used to synthesize the                  biologically active beta-lactam (+)-thienamycin, chiral                         tertiary alcohols for incorporation into macrocyclic                            antibiotics and polyether antibiotics, triquinanes and                          pyrroloindoloquinones.",
