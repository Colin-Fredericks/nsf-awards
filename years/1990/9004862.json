UCLA is committed to matching more than                50% of the acquisition costs of this equipment.                                      The need to better understand the evolution of the Earth and               its natural resources requires continual advances in the ability                to characterize the geochemical properties of Earth materials,                  and isotope geochemistry in particular has made outstanding                     contributions by permitting age dating of materials and events in               Earth history and the use of isotope tracers for delineating the                transfer of material during both local- and global-scale                        processes. The new generation instrument to be acquired through                 this award will extend existing capabilities in the U.S. for                    isotopic analysis of Earth materials by permitting micron-scale,                in-situ, isotopic analyses with detection limits in the part per                billion range. The instrument will be the centerpiece of a                      facility that will be open to earth scientists outside of UCLA                  and will permit the fullest application of recent instrumental                  developments to a better understanding of the origin and                        evolution of the crust and the genesis of mineral resources.",
