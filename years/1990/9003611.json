 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support development of an interactive multimedia                program for the teaching of Japanese to English speaking scientists             and engineers.  The materials will be contextually grounded in                  situations and settings relevant to individuals going to Japan for              the purpose of collaborative research.  The learner will be                     exposed to interactions, characters, and scenarios in much the                  same way that she/he would experience these occurrences:  randomly              (as the video proceeds forward inviting the user to stop and                    select various options) or selectively (as action attracts                      interest). Interspersed with the \"events\" in a simulation will be               a wide variety of linguistic exercises based on the core conversa-              tions of the textbook, Japanese:  The Spoken Language, by Jorden                and Noda (Yale University Press).  Users will be able to selectively            access linguistic and cultural background information far more                  detailed than what is currently available in any textbook.                                                                                                      There is a critical need for more effective communications between              American and Japanese researchers.  This project will help to                   address that need by integrating state-of-the art technology with               sound principles of language pedagogy to produce a multimedia-                  based program of Japanese language instruction oriented to                      scientists and engineers.",
