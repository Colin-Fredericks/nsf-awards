 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex determination in Drosophila is controlled by a regulatory                   hierarchy that has been well characterized at both the genetic and              molecular levels.  However, as with other regulatory gene networks              that participate in the control of Drosophila development, very                 little is known about either the identify of the genes actually                 involved in the terminal steps of differentiation (sometimes                    referred to as the \"downstream genes\") or about how these terminal              genes are controlled by the regulatory genes immediately above them             in the hierarchy.  The objectives of the work set forth in this                 proposal are to identify as many as possible of the downstream                  genes responsible for the differentiation of sexually dimorphic                 adult tissues in Drosophila, and to investigate the molecular                   mechanisms by which doublesex, the bottom regulatory gene in the                somatic sex determination hierarchy, controls the expression of                 these downstream genes.  We will approach these objectives in two               ways; by isolating genes specifically expressed in the male and                 female genital discs, using sensitive novel cDNA subtractive                    hybridization protocols, and by studying the interaction of the                 doublesex proteins with yolk protein genes as a model system for                the control of downstream gene expression; thus yielding new                    insights into molecular mechanisms controlling differentiation.                                                                                                 It has been known since the 1920s that the determination of sex in              the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is controlled by the ratio                of the number of X chromosomes to the number of sets of autosomes               in an individual.  When this ratio is 0.5 (as in an XY individual),             the individual is male; when the ratio is 1.0 (as in an XX                      individual) the individual is female.  It has not been until the                last decade that the genetic pathway and some of the molecular                  details of this sex determination mechanism have been worked out.               It is now clear that the process of choice whether to develop as                a male or as a female is under the control of a small number of                 genes which interact with one another in a complex fashion.  The                author of this proposal has made previous contributions to our                  understanding of these interactions.  As yet we know very little                about how the choice of sexual pathway is implemented.  This is a               proposal to investigate this unexplored area.",
