Methods will consist of                       ethnographic \"participant-observation\" as a medical worker in                   some clinics, and intensive interviewing.                                                                                                                       This research is important because AIDS is one of the most                      important medical facts of life in the modern world.  Increased                 understanding of how the medical model of the disease is created                and modified in the daily practice of hospitals and clinics will                help us understand how to disseminate accurate understanding of                 the disease in the population at large.",
