 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the State University of New York,                  Stony Brook to establish a summer program designed to immerse a                 small group of undergraduate students in an active research                     environment spanning the areas of behavioral neuroscience,                      psychophysiology and the experimental study of decision, choice and             self-control.  The goal underlying this initiative is to introduce              students who are not currently involved in a laboratory research                program to state-of-the-art psychological research in some of the               most interesting and important areas of experimental psychology.                This program is intended to foster interest in, and an appreciation             of, scientific research, especially for those students who might                not otherwise have an opportunity to participate in this type of                activity.  Students will participate in an intense eight-week                   \"hands-on\" research experience where, in addition to learning                   specific laboratory skills, they will be exposed to all phases of               the research process.  They will also receive academic counseling               and have access to a variety of support services.                                                                                                               Undergraduates will conduct independent research projects in one                of nine active research laboratories in the Department of                       Psychology.  They will be closely supervised by faculty but will                be encouraged to take as much responsibility as possible for these              projects.  To supplement the laboratory experience, a variety of                group activities are planned (e.g., lab visits, lab meetings,                   \"brown bag\" lunches, seminars and a mini-symposium).  These                     activities are designed to facilitate student interactions with the             faculty mentors, as well as provide opportunities to share                      experiences with one another.  Since a positive research experience             may significantly affect a student's decision to pursue a career                in scientific research, it is important that an exciting and                    stimulating environment be created.",
