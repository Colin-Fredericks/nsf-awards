 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although growth is a gradual process, many events leading to growth are         likely to be triggered by rapid changes which take place very early             when growth is stimulated by regulators such as growth hormone (GH).            The PI's laboratory recently found that GH stimulates two growth-               related genes, c-fos and c-jun, in less than 30 minutes of exposure of          cells to GH.  These very rapid changes in gene expression are likely to         be among the initial events triggered by GH in target cells.  Since             these genes are known to act coordinately to activate other genes in            growing and differentiating cells, induction of c-fos and c-jun by GH           would be expected to lead to activation of other genes important in the         effects of GH on differentiation and/or metabolism.  Thus, the overall          objective of this grant is to define the mechanisms for the stimulation         by GH of the expression of c-fos and c-jun, and to determine the                consequences of such stimulation by GH in differentiation of 3T3-F442A          cells.  Whether the effect of GH involves the production of messenger           RNA (transcription) for c-fos and c-jun, and/or whether GH affects the          stability of existing messenger RNA for each of the genes will be               determined.  Whether known regulatory regions on the c-fos gene are             sensitive to GH will be examined.  To determine the importance of GH-           induced expression of c-fos and c-jun in 3T3-F442A differentiation, the         PI will prepare cells which produce too much of the products of these           genes, or cells in which expression of c-fos and c-jun is blocked, and          will examine the consequences of such changes on differentiation.  3T3-         F442A cells are well-suited for these studies, since: (a) GH is a key           factor in promoting their differentiation in fat cells, (b) the gene            products Fos and Jun/AP-1 are known to activate other genes in these            cells, and (c) these cells also exhibit a variety of other responses to         GH.  The results of these studies will provide important new insights           into early molecular events in GH action and into the role of the               growth-related genes c-fos and c-jun in GH action.",
