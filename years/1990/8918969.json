 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the project is to develop a quantitative                    interpretation of a new method for measuring deformability of                   cells in culture.  The method is based on a \"cell poker\",                       which measures the resistance of a cell to indentation by a                     small glass probe.  Initial work will involve theoretical                       studies of small indentations of viscoelastic flat layers and                   spheres.  This treatment will be generalized to include a                       surface membrane and will be extended to large-deformation                      viscoelastic behavior and to the analysis of heterogeneous                      and anisotropic objects which model cell structure.  The                        theoretical work will be validated with experimental                            measurements on layer and spherical globules composed of a                      viscoelastic fluid bounded by a surface tension \"membrane\",                     and spheres composed of an elastic crosslinked matrix.                          Similar measurements will be carried out on actin gels.  A                      new cell poker has been devised that permits fluorescence and                   optical microscopic observations simultaneous with                              indentation measurements to observe strain patterns, deformed                   boundaries, and to select specifically labeled cells for                        measurement.  Finally, these quantitative methods will be                       applied to measurements on cytoplasts, i.e. cells from which                    the nucleus has been extruded, and to isolated nuclei to                        determine separately their contribution to cellular                             mechanical properties.                                                                                                                                          These measurements of cellular deformability will allow                         characterization of the cytoskeleton and how it influences                      the shape of a cell and its cytoplasmic consistency. ***",
