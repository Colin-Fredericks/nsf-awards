 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will measure the isotropy of the cosmic microwave                  background radiation (CMBR) at several wavelengths and angular                  scales using radio telescopes placed at South Pole Station,                     Antarctica.  The wavelengths measured will be 3 mm, 12 mm and                   20 mm, wavelengths that are absorbed by water vapor in the                      atmosphere, and because South Pole is one of the driest inhabited               places on Earth, it is an excellent observing site.                                                                                                             The CMBR is radiation that was produced very early in the                       formation of the universe, and its distribution provides the best               information that can be obtained at the present time about how                  the universe was created.  To date, all CMBR observations have                  shown the radiation to be isotropic, that is, the waves arrive at               Earth with equal intensity from all directions.  It is certain                  that at some level the radiation is anisotropic, and the level                  and angular scale at which the radiation loses its isotropy is                  very important for differentiating between various cosmological                 theories.  This investigator has already made measurements from                 South Pole that are the most sensitive ever made anywhere, and                  the results are very close to ruling out one of the standard                    cosmologies, the so-called \"cold dark matter\" model.",
