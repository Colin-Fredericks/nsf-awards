 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study problems concerning                  manifolds with positive Ricci curvature, harmonic maps between                  spheres, and geometry and topology of manifolds with boundary.                  Obstructions to the existence of metrics on Riemannian manifolds                with prescribed curvature conditions will be investigated.  Dirac               bundles and Dirac operators on manifolds with boundary of                       dimension 4 and 5 will be analyzed.                                                  The mathematical object known as a torus has the shape of an               inner tube and is positively curved on the outer parts, while                   negatively curved around the hole.  As a fact, its total                        curvature is zero.  A long time ago mathematicians learned that                 this meant, with a different concept of distance, the torus can                 appear flat.  The principal investigator will continue his                      research into analogous problems concerning such prescribed                     curvature on higher-dimensional manifolds.",
