 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed research is further to elucidate the                role of insect lectins in the defense response against pathogens.               A galactose binding lectin from Spodoptera exigua (beet armyworm)               will be used in these studies.  This lectin is easily extracted                 from larval hemolymph and has been shown to opsonize potential                  fungal pathogens which have surface galactose residues.                         Monoclonal antibodies against the lectin will be prepared in                    order to localize the molecule in insect tissues.  Light and                    electron microscopy will be used for these studies and in                       experiments using direct probes to localize lectin receptors on                 cell walls of selected microorganisms.  Antimicrobial properties                of the lectin will be assessed as well as the fate of opsonized                 microbes phagocytosed by host granulocytes.  Viability of                       ingested cells will be determined by conventional plating methods               and by use of a methylene blue staining assay.  Finally, the                    distribution of lectin receptors on both immunocompetent and                    immunosuppressed granulocytes will be examined.                                                                                                                 Lectins are specific sugar-binding proteins that have been                      detected in the body fluids of numerous animal species.  Although               little is known about the function of these molecules, it has                   been suggested on the basis of a variety of sketchy evidence that               in insects they may function in defense against bacteria or fungi               by coating the microorganisms and promoting their removal by                    scavenger cells in the insect's blood.  This research will                      examine this hypothesis more thoroughly and should elucidate the                role(s) of lectins in an insect's defense against invading                      microorganisms.",
