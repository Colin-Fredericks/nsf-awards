 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work seeks to examine people's psychological and                           physiological reactions to the extreme stress produced by a                     recent natural disaster, the Bay Area earthquake of 17 October                  1989.  The PI has developed a theory of inhibition and                          confrontation with stressors, which holds that when people                      attempt to suppress reactions to stressful events, when they                    refuse to talk about the event, consciously try to stop                         thinking about it, etc., they put themselves at risk for later,                 stress related reactions, which can include the intrusion of                    debilitating thoughts, autonomic nervous system activity and,                   over time, an increase in health problems.                                                                                                                      In the first study, a sample of Bay Area residents will be                      surveyed repeatedly over the course of a year (via telephone),                  and sequential measures of their reaction to the earthquake                     will be taken.  It is predicted that people will differ in the                  ways they inhibit, or confront, the disaster, and these                         reactions, in turn, will have implications for later physical                   health status.  In addition the researchers will interview a                    subsample of the telephone survey respondents, and take a                       series of noninvasive physiological measures (e.g., blood                       pressure), to determine potential relationships between                         reactions to the earthquake (as evidenced on the survey                         questionnaire) and physiological status.                                                                                                                        Also, approximately 700 Bay Area residents (and a comparison                    group of 350 Dallas, TX, residents) will be surveyed over the                   course of the coming year to determine possible changes in                      people's reactions to, and perceptions of, the disaster;                        comparison of these responses with those of the repeatedly                      measured group will be made to determine the effects of                         multiple testing.  In addition, health status measures also                     will be taken.                                                                                                                                                  Finally, various college and non-college groups who differ in                   terms of their plans to stay or quit the Bay Area also will be                  interviewed, and various health status measures will be                         applied.                                                                                                                                                        The research will attempt to show that the form of people's                     reaction to a disaster, and possibly the reactions they exhibit                 over a period of time following the disaster, will have                         implications for their psychological and physical health.  The                  PI's use of the Bay Area disaster as a natural manipulation is                  a smart and opportunistic attempt to make a positive gain from                  a terrible catastrophe.  A rapid NSF response to this request                   would have been very difficult without the SGER program.  For                   this reason alone, the SGER initiative is to be applauded.",
