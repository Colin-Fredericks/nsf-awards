 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will continue on-going research on the conversion from host to               bacteriophage macromolecular synthesis after infection of E. coli               by phage T4.  Our work still centers on the alc gene, which                     directs the host RNA polymerase away from dC-DNA to the HMdC-DNA                of the phage, but also goes on to explore other aspects of the                  transition.  We will continue in-vivo studies of the interaction                of gpalc with the B subunit of RNA polymerase by using various                  polymerase mutants.  A major project will be purification of                    gpalc from clones carrying the gene.  The protein will then be                  used in several in vitro studies, including: (a) effects of                     purified gpalc on transcription of T7 DNA in vitro; (b) use of                  other templates to study the generality and specificity of                      alc-mediated inhibition; (c) interaction of gpalc with                          termination factors; (d) analysis of proteins bound to DNA or to                transcription complexes; (e) footprinting analysis of gpalc                     binding to DNA alone and in the presence of polymerase.  We will                continue our studies on the effects of gpalc on the host nucleoid               structure, using psoralen binding in vivo.  We will investigate                 other phage-encoded proteins that may be involved in the                        transition from host to phage metabolism, particularly looking                  for alterations in the functional or chemical stability of host                 messenger RNA and factors that change initiation factors or that                bind to host ribosomes, altering translational specificity.  By                 cloning otherwise uncharacterized T4 immediate-early genes in                   tightly-regulated expression vectors, we will look for genes                    affecting host physiology.  We will continue to update the T4                   genomic map, to assemble T4 DNA sequences, and to host the                      semiannual international T4 meeting.",
