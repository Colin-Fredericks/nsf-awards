 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to use computer-aided                           fluorescence microscopy to probe the structure and                              compartmentalization of cytoplasm in living cells.  The research                is aimed at three broad goals:  1, to understand the physical-                  chemical basis for the gel properties of cytoplasm; 2, to measure               the solvent viscosity of the fluid that fills the spaces in the                 gel; and 3, to understand the functional implications of apparent               subcellular variations of cytoplasmic structure that lead to                    compartmentalization of the cytoplasmic volume.  In pursuit of                  the first goal, the technique of fluorescence recovery after                    photobleaching (FRAP) will be used to study the tracer diffusion                of size-fractionated, inert, fluorescent particles both in the                  living cell and in solutions and gels reconstituted from                        biological components.  In order to map solvent viscosity in                    living cells, a novel ratio imaging approach will be employed,                  which has been recently developed by Dr. Luby-Phelps.  In                       addition, the ratio imaging techniques will be applied to the                   study of cytoplasmic compartmentalization during a variety of                   cellular functions.                                                                                                                                             Although it has been studied for over 150 years, the                            submicrosopic architecture of cytoplasm still is not completely                 understood.  From these studies, it is hoped that a \"picture\" of                cytoplasm can be built up that can serve as a framework for                     understanding cellular biochemistry and metabolism.",
