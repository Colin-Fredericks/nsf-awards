 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns several problems which lie at the                   interface of operator theory and function theory.  The first part               of the project involves polynomial approximation directed at                    understanding certain measures on the closed unit disc.  The                    other part of the project involves a study of the composition                   operators on various spaces of analytic functions.  This includes               work on identifying the spectrum of a composition operator,                     continuing work on the study of composition operators on large                  weighted Bergman spaces, and the question of identifying the                    components in the space of composition operators in the uniform                 operator topology.                                                                   This research is in the general area of modern analysis and,               as noted above, lies at the interface of operator theory and                    function theory.  The research involves the study of composition                operators on spaces of analytic functions in one or several                     complex variables and is a central topic in the modern theory of                complex analysis.",
