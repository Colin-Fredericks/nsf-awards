In most natural disasters, there is                                             significant direct impact on human                                              populations:  specifically injuries and death                                   result from the hazard itself, or as a result                                   of the particular hazard's effect on the                                        infrastructure.  While advances in engineering                                  have certainly lessened this impact over the                                    past several decades, there are still many                                      unanswered questions as to the precise cause                                    and severity of injuries occurring during                                       natural disasters.  By applying techniques                                      developed in the relatively new field of                                        earthquake injury epidemiology, the research                                    described in this proposal will enable a                                        detailed epidemiologic study to be made of the                                  injuries resulting from the 1989 Loma Prieta                                    earthquake in the County of Santa Cruz.                                         Preliminary quick-response field                                                reconnaissance - already performed - coupled                                    with comprehensive follow-up data collection                                    and interviews will enable a detailed                                           accounting of all the injuries in the County                                    resulting from the earthquake.  This                                            information will be of significant use for                                      earthquake preparedness and hazard mitigation                                   activities.  In addition, collection of the                                     data will enable the testing of the research                                    methodology for application in future events.",
