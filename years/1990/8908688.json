One of                                      the areas of responsibility of this UJNR                                        panel is to coordinate ongoing tsunami                                          research in Japan and the United States.                                                                                                                        Tsunamis (seismic sea waves) pose a threat to                                   certain coastal areas of the United States,                                     principally to Hawaii and Alaska, but also to                                   the coastal areas of northern California,                                       Oregon, and the Caribbean.  However they pose                                   a significantly greater threat to coastal                                       areas of Japan, especially from earthquakes                                     generated within the Sea of Japan.  It is                                       very much to the benefit of tsunami                                             researchers in Japan and the United States to                                   coordinate their respective research efforts.                                                                                                                   The First U.S.-Japan Workshop on Tsunamis was                                   held in Tsukuba, Japan on May 12-13, 1983.                                      This second workshop is planned for 5-6                                         November 1990 in Hawaii, with a visit on 7                                      November to the National Oceanic and                                            Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Pacific                                       Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach.  The                                       focus for this workshop is on the application                                   of numerical techniques to tsunami hazard                                       mitigation: participants include both                                           researchers and persons responsible for the                                     implementation of tsunami hazard mitigation.                                                                                                                    This action is to provide support for this                                      workshop.",
