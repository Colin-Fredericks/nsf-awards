 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to understand meiosis at a mechanistic level we are                    dissecting a simple meiotic process which occurs in Drosophila                  melanogaster.  This process, known as distributive pairing,                     involves the pairing and segregation of chromosomes in the                      absence of exchange.  We have characterized two loci which                      impair this system, namely the Axs locus, required for                          chromosome pairing, and nod which is essential for a chromosome                 modification event that ensures disjunction.  We have cloned                    and sequenced much of the nod locus and have executed a                         chromosome walk in the Axs region.  We now propose to dissect                   the nod locus by mapping and sequencing seven nod mutations as                  well as nod-cognate clone from Drosophila simulans.  In order                   to ascertain whether the nod+ gene product belongs to a member                  of a known family of proteins or represents a novel function,                   we will determine the primary amino acid sequence of the nod+                   gene product by cDNA sequencing.  We also propose a                             transcriptional analysis to determine when in oocyte                            development the nod locus is expressed.  Antibodies produced                    against the nod gene product will allow us to determine the                     cellular localization of the nod+  protein.  We also propose a                  genetic screen for mutations in loci which interact with the                    nod locus.  Finally, we propose to clone and sequence the Axs                   locus.  The analysis of this locus will provide crucial                         insights into the physical basis of pairing.  These studies                     will provide basic molecular information regarding meiotic                      pairing and segregation.                                                                                                                                        This is a continuation of support for investigation into the                    mechanisms of chromosome pairing, a crucial step in the                         transmission of genetic information from one generation to the                  next.  The work to be done under this award carries to the                      molecular level the genetic analysis begun with the previous                    award.",
