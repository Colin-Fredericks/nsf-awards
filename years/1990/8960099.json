 "awd_abstract_narration": "As switching time requirements and chip size decrease,                          submicron geometries will be an inevitable trend in the                         integrated circuit industry in the 1990s.  In order to                          achieve the required small geometries and high yields,                          stringent demands will be made on resist technology.                            Although there are many electron-beam resists which                             have submicron resolution, none of them totally meet all                        performance requirements.  Due to the inherent                                  characteristics of high glass transition temperature,                           effective adhesion, thermal stability, and dry etching                          durability of aromatic silicon-containing polymer and the                       high radiation sensitivity of chloromethyl styrene,                             copolymers of chloromethyl styrene and several aromatic                         silicon-containing monomers will be investigated as high                        resolution electron-beam bilayer resists.  The resist                           sensitivity is proportional to the molecular weight of the                      copolymer and mutually incompatible with resolution,                            which is a function of polydispersity.  Improvement of                          adhesion, thermal stability, and dry etching durability is                      often at the expense of sensitivity.  Thus, the effects of                      the molecular structure and the synthetic parameters on                         these properties will be studied.  As the lithographic                          process is vital for developing a new submicron resist                          system, the processing parameters will be optimized for                         the chloromethyl styrene and aromatic silicon-containing                        copolymer with optimum molecular design in order to                             obtain a thermally stable and dry etching resistant                             electron-beam resist with high sensitivity and resolution.",
