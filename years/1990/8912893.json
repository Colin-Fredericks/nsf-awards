The investigator plans to                            characterize the size distribution and biodegradability of                                                                                                      organic matter in complex wastewaters as a step toward                          more efficient design of processes that utilize                                 biologically active films.  Initial efforts will be                             concentrated on the dextrans as model carbohydrates and                         albumins as model proteins.  Following development of                           analytical techniques in the laboratory utilizing these                         readily characterized organic compounds, macromolecule                          consumption and production will be studied in complex                           wastewaters obtained from operational wastewater treatment                                                                                                      systems that use a biofilm reactor process.                                                                                                                     Fixed-film, bioreactors are potentially capable of being                        more extensively used in place of or complementary to                           suspended-growth bioprocess systems.  This research offers                                                                                                      the potential of making it possible to design fixed-film                        systems without going through a pilot-plant stage for                           adapting design criteria to a specific wastewater's                             characteristics.",
