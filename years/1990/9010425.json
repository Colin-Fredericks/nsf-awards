 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the antecedents of mood, affect,                and optimism, and the effects of these factors on subsequent                    behavior.  The research is to be undertaken by two of the very                  best investigators in this line of work. Their past research is                 highly respected and widely cited.  The underlying assumption of                the research is that affect, mood, and optimism is tied to the                  individual's perception of the rate at which he or she is                       progressing toward a desired goal.  Developmental and applied                   promises to detail not only the antecedents of mood and optimism,               but also the effects of these transient (in the case of mood) or                chronic dispositional (in the case of optimism) features on the                 behavior of the individual.  The fundamental gains to be realized               in this research are impressive.  Equally impressive are the                    implications of this set of investigations for applied research                 (e.g., on health).  All in all, this set of investigations                      presents an ideal blend of basic, applied, and developmental                    research approaches, all focused on an important topic, by highly               qualified researchers.  The program of research promises to tell                us much of the manner in which personal factors influence the                   fundamental status of the human organism.",
