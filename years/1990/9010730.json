 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to develop realistic, partially              synchronous models of distributed systems and to determine the                  relationships between them.  A variety of partially synchronous models          will be collected by studying real distributed protocols and                    formulating their timing requirements as abstractly as possible.                Application areas include distributed file systems and communication            networks.  Relationships between the models will be determined by               defining simulations between models and looking for problems that               differentiate them.  Timing constraints will be added to distributed            problems (previously studied without them) and the resulting upper and          lower bounds on time complexity will be analyzed.  The first problem            to be so analyzed is that of implementing atomic registers.                                                                                                     The significance of identifying partially synchronous models is that            they are more realistic than the two extreme timing models                      (synchronous and asynchronous) often used.  Understanding the                   relationships between models is important because they indicate                 precisely what time behavior is necessary and sufficient for                    particular properties to hold.  Systems builders can then concentrate           on providing the appropriate time behavior.  Model simulations can              save work and unify results when results carry over from one model to           another.  Studying real protocols and specific problems can lead to             results that are useful in the specific problem domains.",
