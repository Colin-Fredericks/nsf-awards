 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing evidence suggests that democratic countries rarely fight             wars with other democratic countries.  In a world where democracy               seems to be becoming a more common form of government, this evidence            would further suggest that international wars will become less                  common.  Nevertheless, the evidence is not conclusive:                          other influences, such as mutually high levels of income or                     participation in an alliance, may also help to explain the absence of           war between many democratic countries.  Moreover, the theoretical               understanding of why democracies may behave peacefully toward one               another is not yet fully persuasive.  To understand this phenomenon             better, this project examines patterns of war and peace between very            different kinds of units, namely, the usually small ethnographic                units that have been systematically studied by anthropologists.  The            project will scale a representative sample of such societies on a               dimension ranging from hierarchical to participatory political                  systems, and then inquire (with proper controls) whether                        participatory societies have less internal war than do hierarchical             ones, and whether in relations with other societies participatory               societies are less likely to fight other participatory societies than           hierarchical ones.  By establishing these patterns, and the social              processes that promote them, the project should help in understanding           the basis of relations between larger units such as nation-states.                                                                                              The project includes a Research Experience for Undergraduates                   component that involves students in the coding and collection of data           that will be used for subsequent analysis.  The two students should             have an exciting and informative educational experience working on              this inter-disciplinary project under the direct supervision of three           outstanding scholars.",
