 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary purpose of the proposed research is the                        determination of the requirement for acceleration of particles,                 especially electrons during solar flares, which is as yet an                    unsolved problem.  Theoretical studies will be made of the                      interaction of accelerated particles with ambient plasma                        including interactions with particles, waves, and large scale                   magnetic fields.  Comparison with observed impulsive phase                      radiation such as X-rays, gamma rays, microwaves and type III                   radiation is used for constraining the models and for                           determination of the characteristics of the accelerated                         particles. Comparison will be made with both old and new                        observations as they become available during the next solar                     maximum, with the goal of obtaining more realistic models and                   furthering investigation of the acceleration process.  Results                  from this research should have direct application to other areas                of scientific research including solar terrestrial relations,                   magnetospheric physics, stellar flares, gamma ray bursts and                    activity in galactic nuclei.",
