Midwestern State University will initiate an                     8-week residential Young Scholars project for 14 students in                    grade 12 in chemistry.  The Chemistry Department at                             Midwestern State University, which has 11 years experience                      in research projects with high school students, has designed                    eight-week research projects for 14 rural high school                           students with no more than three students to a professor.                       These students will come from within an 80 mile radius of                       Wichita Falls.  They will also receive formal career                            counseling, computer training, minicourses in technical                         writing, research methodology, and special topics in                            chemistry.  Field trips to several outstanding research                         laboratories and participation in two student-faculty panels                    on philosophy and ethics are also included.  Most of these                      activities will continue at M.S.U. on one or more Saturdays                     each month during the academic year.",
