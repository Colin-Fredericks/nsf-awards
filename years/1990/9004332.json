 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reproduction of fish, as in other vertebrates, is controlled by the             brain through the endocrine system.  The pituitary gland plays a major          role in initiating reproductive maturation (puberty), maintaining               production of sperm and eggs by the gonads, and inducing final                  maturation and gamete release (spawning).  In tetrapod vertebrates, two         pituitary hormones regulate reproduction; follicle-stimulating hormone          (FSH), which stimulates early stages of gametogenesis, and luteinizing          hormone, which induces ovulation and corpus luteum formation in the             female, for example.  Until recently, it was generally believed that            the pituitary gland of fish produced only one hormone that controlled           all aspects of reproduction.  It is now established that in salmon              there are two pituitary hormones, gonadotropin I and gonadotropin II,           that may control reproduction.  The proposed research will study the            functions of these two gonadotropins in salmon.  The study will also            address when the two gonadotropins first appear in the pituitary gland          and blood, and how the brain controls their synthesis and release.                                                                                              This work is significant in that it should advance our knowledge of how         salmon reproduction is controlled.  Since it is well-established that           reproduction in tetrapod vertebrates is controlled by two pituitary             hormones, comparison of fish can be made with mammals, birds,                   amphibians and reptiles.  This information should give us a better              perspective on vertebrate reproduction in general.  Futhermore, a               better understanding of the control of fish reproduction will allow the         rational development of techniques to manage reproduction of captive            broodstock in fish aquaculture.",
