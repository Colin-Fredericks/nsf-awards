 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will examine basic processes in forest tree               ecology: dispersal (seeds), and survival of seedlings (as                       affected by fire).  By investigating these life history traits in               longleaf pine populations, this research will provide a number of               new insights.  First, this research will provide important                      information about dispersal abilities of forest tree species.                   There is a gap in knowledge of the amount of seeds that trees                   produce and how far seeds are dispersed.  Second, how patterns of               dispersal; reflect establishment and growth of seedlings will be                elucidated.  It is important to determine what factors play a                   role in the success of forest species from seeds to juveniles to                adults.  Finally, because some forest species, such as longleaf                 pine, can grow better in the presence of fire, it is important to               see if fire plays a role in survival of seedlings.                                   This research has many silvicultural applications.  From                   this study, the optimum distance of seed dispersal can be                       predicted.  This information will be helpful in management of                   pine populations.  Second, the factors influencing survival can                 be determined.  This information will be beneficial in increasing               yields.  Third, the study will shed light on how juvenile                       patterns reflect optimum forest structure, important in the                     thinning and spacing of trees.  Finally, this research will                     provide information about fire effects and growth of forest                     species.",
