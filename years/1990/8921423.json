 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research investigates contemporary economic and                    structural pressures facing many American business firms.  The                  objective of this ambitious project is to examine an inducement-                contribution approach for managing employee-organizational                      relationships.  The link between macro variables (contract versus               mutual investment strategies) and micro variables (individual                   incentives) is implied in the literature, but has not previously                been investigated.  The proposal describes an investigation of the              relations between two types of organizational inducement                        strategies, on the one hand, and three forms of employee                        contributions, on the other.                                                                                                                                    The research is based on a conceptual perspective drawn from the                work of managerial theorists, organizational sociologists and                   psychologists, and institutional economists.  Based on an                       integrative theoretical approach, a set of hypotheses are proposed              for empirical analysis.  The methodology involves a cross-sectional             study of three companies in each of three industries, with an                   average of ten occupational job groups within each company.  The                data collected from the research are likely to have long-term                   significance for both theory and application.  Moreover, the                    project should set the stage for follow-up research in this field               in coming years.",
