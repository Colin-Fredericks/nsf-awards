 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of the computer in the search for new exceptional                      combinatorial configurations, as well as in the proofs of their                 nonexistence, has been increasing over the last few years.  It is now           an indispensable tool in research in this area.  There have been many           attempts to build appropriate software in this direction worldwide,             but none with the range of specific goals proposed here.  The four              areas of interest are: balance designs, Ramsey graphs, perpendicular            arrays and set coverings systems.  Previous research in                         these areas repeatedly called for similar algorithms, which were                implemented in an ad hoc manner, depending on the particular                    situation.  There were even variations of the same algorithm within             the same area.  A principal goal of this one year project is to                 refine, streamline and package the existing algorithms, using agreed            upon uniform data structures.  With these algorithms one can devote             more attention on the theoretical properties of the set systems                 rather than on programming.  Particular attention will also be focused          on finding some new important configuations.",
