 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists              in a joint U.S.-Japan seminar on \"Bioorganic Marine Chemistry,\" to              be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, December 3-7, 1990.  The principal                 areas for discussion are (a) cultured marine microorganisms as                  sources of drugs, (b) isolation, structure determination, and                   pharmacological evaluation of bioactive compounds from marine                   organisms, (c) marine chemical ecology, and (d) synthesis and                   biosynthesis of marine natural products.  The co-organizers of the              seminar are Professor Francis J. Schmitz, Department of Chemistry               and Biochemistry, University of Oklahoma, and Professor Takeshi                 Yasumoto, Faculty of Agriculture, Tohoku University, Japan.  The                field of marine natural products is a flourishing one in which a                wide variety of bioactive compounds with novel structures, many of              them quite distinct from terrestrial natural products, are being                discovered.  Researchers in the United States and Japan are                     especially active in this field, and the seminar will permit                    representatives of several research groups in the two countries to              meet, exchange information, and develop relationships that could                lead to more extensive research collaboration.                                                                                                                  There is considerable interest in exploring the oceans for                      bioactive substances useful as antitumor, antifungal, and                       antiinflammatory  agents, and for other medicinal purposes.  Other              compounds from the sea are finding use as biochemical and                       pharmacological tools for studying mechanisms of action in life                 processes.  There has been recent attention to the role of marine               microorganisms in the production of bioactive compounds, including              marine toxins which threaten human health.  Because of the large                amount of basic and applied research being carried out in the                   United States and Japan in bioorganic marine chemistry, information             and ideas shared at this seminar can be expected to have a                      significant impact on future progress in the field, at both the                 fundamental and practical levels.",
