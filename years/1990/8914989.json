 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. James                Hynes, University of Colorado, and Dr. Daniel Borgis, Laboratoire               de Physique Theoretique des Liquides, University of Pierre and                  Marie Curie, Paris, France.  The objective of the project is to                 develop an improved theory for treating simple proton transfer                  reactions in solution.                                                                                                                                          Protein transfer reactions in solution play a central role in                   chemistry, in particular in acid-base chemistry and enzyme                      catalysis.  However, no comprehensive molecular level description               of such reactions and their rates yet exist.  In part, this is due              to their special character, which includes quantum proton tunnelling            through a barrier rather than classical thermal activation over                 it, and an essential involvement of the surrounding polar solvent               molecules strongly coupled to the proton.  Aided by recent                      advances in theoretical and computer simulation techniques, the                 investigators propose to perform molecular dynamics computer                    simulation of model proton transfer reactions in polar solvents.                Reaction rates will be calculated and the role of solvent polarity              and dynamics, and of certain molecular vibrations, will be                      determined.  Simple yet realistic models will be initially                      employed to clarify the essential reaction features and to                      establish the simulation techniques.  The systems studied will then             progress to even more realistic systems directly susceptible to                 experimental investigation.  Emphasis will be placed on calculating             quantities (e.g. solvent dependence, isotope effects) which can                 guide the interpretation of experiments.  A detailed microscopic                description of proton transfer reactions is expected to result                  from the project.  The proposed study  should provide theoretical               insight into understanding this important reaction class and also               should provide an impetus for new experiments to probe the                      influence on these rates of solvent polarity and dynamics.  The                 project will benefit for the complementary expertise of the two                 investigators in this rapidly developing area of physical chemistry.",
