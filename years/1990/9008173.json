 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work will focus on the structure and function of                   protein-bound covalent phosophorus residues in two                              proteins: Azotobacter vinelandii (strain OP) flavodoxin and                     bovine milk xanthine oxidase.  In the case of flavodoxin, a novel               phosphodiester crosslink between a seryl and a threonyl residue                 has been identified.  Work  over the past project period has                    shown this crosslink appears to have a structural function and                  that cloning the flavodoxin gene and expressing it in E. coli                   results in formation of the flavodoxin without this covalent                    phosphorus residue.  The PI plans to extend these studies to 1)                 identify the sequence location of the phosphate-bridged seryl and               threonyl residues, 2) examine the comparative physical and                      chemical properties of the \"dephospho\" cloned flavodoxin with                   that of the phospho wild-type form, 3) initiate studies to                      characterize the enzyme system responsible for incorporation of                 the phosphodiester linkage into the protein, 4) initiate studies                using site-directed mutagenesis as a probe of protein structure                 and function, 5) identify non-phospho crosslinks suggested to                   occur in Azotobacter  vinelandii  (strain 478) flavodoxin and                   maybe present in flavodoxin isolated from other organisms, and                  6) prepare a polyclonal antibody against a synthetic peptide                    containing a ser-thr phosphodiester linkage to use as a probe to                test whether this linkage occurs in proteins in other organisms.                Previous work in this laboratory (supported by NSF) has shown                   bovine milk xanthine oxidase to contain a phosphoseryl residue                  near the active site Mo center of the enzyme.  Preliminary                      31P NMR and mass spectroscopic data suggest substrate                           turnover results in the incorporation of solvent oxygen into this               phosphorus residue.  Work is proposed to extend these findings to               determine if this phosphoseryl residue is the active site                       nucleophile involved in the mechanism of xanthine oxidation.                    Evidence for covalent 32P incorporation in the related enzymes:                 chicken liver xanthine dehydrogenase and rabbit liver aldehyde                  oxidase will be obtained by cell growth in the presence of 32Pi                 and using antibodies to probe whether synthesized xanthine                      dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase also contain covalently-bound                phosphorus residues.  From this laboratory ENDOR data and recent                ENDOR data published by Bray; evidence is presented to suggest a                phosphorus ligand to the functional Mo center of xanthine                       oxidase.  Further experiments will be done to further determine                 whether this signal is indeed due to phosphorus and whether that                phosphorus is due to the phosphoseryl residue.  The results of                  these studies should expand our understanding of the role of                    phospho residues in protein structure and function and may have                 relevance to a wide range of problems in biochemistry.",
