It is located in the San                   Juan Islands where an unusual diversity and richness of marine                  life occurs.  Research projects conducted at FHL have helped to                 reveal the important ecological relationships which underlie the                health and stability of the marine environment; have determined                 the effects of physical, biological and environmental factors on                eggs, larvae and juveniles of the many invertebrate and plant                   species which reside at the base of the marine food web; and have               led to the development and use model organisms for the study of                 embryos, functional morphology and physiology.                                       This project will fill a major gap at FHL.  The marine                     environment is richly endowed with planktonic fishes.  This is                  especially true in the Pacific Northwest region.  However,                      surprisingly little is known about the identity and role of most                fish larvae in the plankton.  Furthermore, a great deal is yet to               be learned about the physiology and mechanics of adult fish,                    especially non-commercial species.  The project will provide                    funds to construct and equip a laboratory to allow work in these                areas.",
