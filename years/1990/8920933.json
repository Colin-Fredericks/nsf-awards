 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the interactions                      between international trade and economic growth.  Theoretical                   models of the growth process will be developed based on                         endogenous technological progress and the accumulation of human                 capital.  The models will be designed to permit the study of how                international trade linkages and the international dissemination                of knowledge and information affect the incentives of individuals               and firms to invest in new skills and technologies.  This                       research is important because it will provide a better basis for                understanding the role of international trade in promoting growth               and development in the U.S. and other economies.                                                                                                                This project consists of two parts.  The first part is aimed at                 developing a theoretical framework for analyzing the process of                 ongoing product improvements.  The framework will be used to                    study the positive and normative issues concerning R&D rivalry                  between firms in industrialized countries and linkages between                  innovating firms in the developed countries and imitating firms                 in the less developed ones.  The second part is concerned with                  analyzing the process of the international transfer of                          information and technology.  Various mechanisms for technology                  transfer will be investigated including the transfer of knowledge               between trading partners, between subsidiaries of multinational                 corporations, and between the parties of international licensing                agreements.",
