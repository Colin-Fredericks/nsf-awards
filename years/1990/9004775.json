 "awd_abstract_narration": "gonadal (gdl) is a gene that is differentially expressed in the                 male and female germ lines of Drosophila. This proposal describes               experiments that address gdl function in the germ line, sex-                    specific expression of the gdl gene products, and complex                       regulation of the gene during gametogenesis. The specific goals                 of the research are summarized as follows. First, complementing                 genetic techniques will be used to isolate gdl mutant alleles.                  The gdl mutants will then be characterized as to specific                       phenotype, with the overall objective being to determine the role               gdl plays in the male and/or female germ line. Second, Dr. Schulz               will generate antibodies directed against gdl proteins so as to                 facilitate the characterization of the gene products. The                       objective is to determine whether the proteins have common or                   different functions during spermatogenesis and oogenesis. Third,                he will study gdl expression in mutations affecting germ cell                   differentiation. These studies may identify genes that regulate                 gdl and should provide additional information on gene expression                in the early germ line. Additionally, gdl may serve as a                        sensitive sex specific differentiation marker during                            gametogenesis. Overall, the extensive analysis of the gdl gene                  should enhance the current understanding of germ cell                           differentiation in Drosophila.",
