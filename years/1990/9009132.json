Current research on memory                  suggests that repeated questioning about a past event can                       enhance the consistency with which one recalls the event.  The                  PI intends to test various explanations of this finding with                    children, to determine the factors that influence the accuracy                  (or inaccuracy) of children's autobiographical memory.  The                     research has important implications not only for theories of                    memory, but for more practical concerns, as well.  For example,                 it may shed light on issues of the reliability of children's                    courtroom testimony under repeated questioning, etc.  This                      research has the potential to expand our understanding of the                   factors that affect our memories of important life events.",
