 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a fifteen month comparative study of the ecology and               behavior of Macaca tonkeana and Macaca hecki in the narrow                      isthmus of Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.  The isthmus averages                   only 35 km in width, and the ranges of these two species come                   into contact in this narrow area.  The two species are                          morphologically very similar, previously having been classified                 as the same species.  Differences between these two species have                persisted despite the lack of geographical or climatic barriers                 to contact.  This suggests that features of the ecology and                     behavior of the two species may serve as mechanisms to keep the                 two species distinct in an area of parapatry.  The focus of this                investigation will be to identify and examine these mechanisms.                      Knowledge of the presence or absence of ecological and                     behavioral separation between M. tonkeana and M. hecki will                     increase our understanding of the manner in which these two forms               are maintained as distinct entities in an area of parapatry or                  possible sympatry.  This study may contribute to new models for                 understanding and interpreting the maintenance, and ultimately,                 the creation of diversity in the genus Macaca and other closely                 related primates.  The proposed research is relevant to attempts                to understand general mechanisms of diversification in primates                 and other mammals.",
