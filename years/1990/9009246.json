 "awd_abstract_narration": "Admicellar catalysis, a novel technique to enhance reaction                     rates and selectivities. will be investigated.  The hydrolysis                  of ethyl benzoate has been selected as a model reaction.  The                   catalysis by a cationic surfactant adsorbed on porous silica                    will be studied over a range of surface coverages, support                      surface areas, and porosities, and solution pH and reactant                     concentrations.  The objectives are (1) the quantitative                        evaluation of admicellar catalysis, and (2) the clarification                   of the morphology of the adsorbed surfactant aggregates.                                                                                                        Admicellar catalysis is similar in many ways to micellar                        catalysis.  Exploitation of micellar catalysis is discourage                    by the difficulty of product separation from the catalyst.                      The significant advantages of admicellar catalysis are                          expected to include (1) easy separation of the catalyst from                    the product, and (2) enhanced reaction rates and selectivities                  due to the particular characteristics of adsorbed surfactant                    aggregates.  the results of this study may lead to new,                         efficient catalytic processes for production of pesticides,                     pharmaceuticals, and other highly specific reaction products,                   and to new processes for hazardous chemical detoxification.                     In addition, this study should provide new knowledge on                         absorbed surfactant aggregate structures.  This information is                  of great practical importance to the fields of detergency,                      enhanced oil recovery, and numerous other areas.",
