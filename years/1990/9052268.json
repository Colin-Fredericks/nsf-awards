 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent decades increased competition has occurred among                 industries at the international level.  An increase in national                 and regional industrial productivity appears essential in this                  highly competitive climate.  There is a need for new graduates in               engineering and engineering technology to be capable of quickly                 making contributions in industry upon graduation.  This project                 is aimed at providing engineering and engineering technology                    students with educational experiences in computer-based                         industrial measurements and control that will allow them to more                quickly and more intelligently make their contributions.                                                                                                             This project utilizes industrial-quality computers,                        interfacing equipment, and transducers that are assembled in                    order that ten experiments are performed in computer control of                 industrial processes.  At least five third and fourth year                      courses are affected.  The award is being matched by an equal                   amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
