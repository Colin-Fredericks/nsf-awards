 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, organizational ecologists have studied the forces of                  competition and legitimation by analyzing organization's                        founding and failure rates.  At the same time, economists have                  studied how forces of competition shape organizational size                     distributions.  The proposed research will integrate these two                  perspectives by determining whether size gives organizations                    competitive advantages that decrease their chances of failure                   and increase their changes of growth.  The study will also                      address whether changes in founding and failure rates cause                     changes in the level of resources available for organizational                  growth.  Finally, the proposed research investigates how                        historical events have shaped processes of competition and                      legitimation.  Data on banks in Manhattan will be used.",
