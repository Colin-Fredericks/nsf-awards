 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigators, David Hoffman and Joel Spruck, will                conduct research in differential geometry, calculus of variations               and applied Mathematics.  This research has a strong                            computational component, while still addressing problems of                     current theoretical interest.  The computational side two                       aspects: Implementation of algorithms to solve problems in                      partial differential equations (arising from physical problems)                 and scientific graphics.  This research involves collaboration                  with many technical people and scientists from other disciplines,               as well as a large number of students and visitors and an active                research and training seminar.  Critical to these projects has                  been the creation of a computational laboratory, which has become               the core of the Geometry Analysis Numerics and Graphics Center                  (GANG).  Under the technical direction of David Oliver with                     collaboration of James T. Hoffman, senior graphics programmer,                  the laboratory is not only supporting high level scientific                     research, but also producing graphics tools for other sites and                 providing vital technical assistance to mathematicians and                      scientists with the need for aid scientific visualization.                      Among the active research projects are: construction of periodic                minimal surfaces; investigation of block copolymer interfaces                   influenced by boundary constraints; computational fluid dynamics;               computational algorithms for plasma confinement; and theoretical                and numerical investigation of motion by mean curvature.",
