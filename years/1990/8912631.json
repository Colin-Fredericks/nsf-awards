 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Wojciech Szpankowski of Purdue University to            collaborate in computer science research with Drs. Peter Kirschenhofer          and Helmut Prodinger of the Department of Algebra and Discrete                  Mathematics of the Technical University of Vienna.  They are developing         theoretical methods for the analysis of algorithms and data structures,         drawing from several areas of applied mathematics.  They plan to                apply these methods to an in-depth analysis of the average case                 behavior of digital search algorithms.  Collaboration is necessary              because the problems they want to attack require diverse expertise in           several fields of mathematics.  The primary responsibilities of the             Austrian collaborators in this project involve their expertise in               asymptotic approximation and combinatorial analysis, while Dr.                  Szpankowski contributes expertise in stochastic modelling and general           problem formulation.                                                                                                                                            The analysis of algorithms and data structures is a rapidly developing          area in theoretical computer science with a strong impact on practical          problems.  The cost of performance of algorithms, including such                factors as the storage requirements of data structures and the                  execution time of certain subroutines, is usually described in terms            of worst case behavior and average case behavior.  Digital tree                 search is one of the main approaches to data storage and retrieval.             The proposed research on average case behavior of digital search                trees will contribute to improved choice and design of data structures          and the new analytical techniques will have relevance in other areas.",
