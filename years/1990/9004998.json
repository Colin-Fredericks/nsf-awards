 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research address the problem of providing efficient                        transactional access to distributed databases.  A new mode of                   locks, termed ordered-shared mode, is proposed that permits data                sharing in a constrained manner.  A family of locking-based                     concurrency control protocols is developed by using three modes                 of locks: shared, ordered-shared, and non-shared.  The strictest                protocol in this family is the two phase locking protocol for                   databases, while the most permissive recognizes all conflict-                   preserving serializable histories.  This is the first locking-                  based concurrency protocol that recognizes the entire class of                  conflict-preserving serializable histories.  Theoretical and                    empirical studies of these protocols will be conducted during                   this project. The theoretical comparison is based on the analysis               of sets of histories produced by the protocols.  The empirical                  analysis involves building a performance model and a database                   system test-bed.  Distributed database concurrency control                      protocols based on ordered-shared locks will be developed and                   implemented on a distributed database test-bed.  Finally, the                   new mode of locks will be used to develop protocols for database                system recovery, nested transactions, and abstract data types.",
