 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of separations science and in the subfield of               gas chromatography.  The thrust of this activity is the                         evaluation and refinement of a novel gas chromatographic column                 that has (a) a stationary phase of high thermal stability bonded                to aluminum, (b) a gradient of film thickness of stationary phase               that provides both high sample capacity and high resolving power,               and (c) the ability to perform size-exclusion chromatography in                 addition to partition chromatography.  These columns will be                    prepared by anodizing the internal surfaces of aluminum tubing and              bonding stationary phases irreversibly to the anodized layer.                   Control of the depth and diameter of the pores which are produced               in the anodized layer will be achieved by control and variation of              the anodization conditions.  Variation of the film thickness of                 the stationary phase will follow the natural variation of the                   thickness of the anodized layer along the axis of the tube.  The                effective diameter of the pores will be effected through selection              of stationary phases with different molecular dimensions.                                                                                                       The successful achievement of these Phase I goals should provide                proof-of-concept that is necessary for Phase II work.  The                      approach to gas chromatographic column preparation embodied in                  this research could impact significantly on the current                         chromatographic practice.",
