 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Arizona University (NAU) will establish a Program for                  Excellence in Precollege Chemical Education to provide                          comprehensive summer training experiences for l92 teachers of                   general and advanced high school chemistry courses during the                   summers and academic years of l990-1993.  These workshops will be               conducted by experienced, master high school teachers and                       University faculty.  The goals of the project are (1) to                        encourage changes in the methods of high school chemistry                       instruction to show more strongly the application of modern                     technology to the teaching of chemistry and (2) to provide a                    cadre of enthusiastic, well-qualified teachers to teach both                    general chemistry and advanced high school chemistry courses,                   honors, enrichment and/or AP courses.  As a result of these                     workshops, the courses taught by these teachers should have                     sufficient relevance, appeal and challenge to encourage more                    students to enjoy science and to pursue chemistry at the                        postsecondary level.                                                                                                                                            Forty eight teachers per year for each of the four years will be                selected to attend one of two parallel workshops.  One group will               be comprised of those teachers who have an adequate content                     background for the teaching of a first-year chemistry course, but               who lack any expertise in the use of technology and current                     science teaching methods, such as cooperative learning and                      microscale laboratory.  This three-week workshop will stress the                blend of content, technology, and methodology. The participants                 of the second three-week workshop will be selected from among                   teachers who are very well-prepared, content-wise and are                       comfortable with use of technology, but who need an update on                   modern and/or more advanced topics, since they are being assigned               to teach a second-level chemistry course.  NAU has piloted this                 second workshop very successfully in the past.  As a result of                  several surveys taken at NSTA regional meetings, local teachers                 have expressed the need not only for the continuation and                       expansion of these Advanced Chemistry Workshops, but the addition               of the General Chemistry Workshop as described above.                                                                                                           The schools from which the majority of the teachers will be                     selected are in regions serving large numbers of minorities and                 underrepresented groups, both Hispanic and native American.  One                half to two thirds of project participants will come from those                 population groups.  Northern Arizona University has demonstrated                its ability to attract teachers from this region to workshops for               advanced chemistry teachers on the basis of its expertise and                   geographical location.                                                                                                                                          An amount equivalent to approximately 30% of the NSF request is                 being cost shared by the NAU, school districts and grants from                  the Eisenhower Math and Science Education funds of the State of                 Arizona.",
