 "awd_abstract_narration": "People can learn that different events are interchangeable                      because they essentially \"mean the same thing.\"  Such \"stimulus                 equivalences\" are one means by which people can respond                         immediately and appropriately to new situations on the basis of                 learning and experience in other situations.  This characteristic               of behavior is often regarded as special, and maybe unique, to                  human beings.  Is language necessary for this important                         behavioral attribute?  If animals without language can learn                    stimulus equivalences, language is not necessary.                                                                                                               Dr. Zentall, in collaboration with Dr. Peter J. Urcuioli, of                    Purdue University, will examine this question using pigeons as                  the experimental animal.  Well-established training techniques                  and the excellent visual abilities of pigeons make them a most                  appropriate choice.  The pigeons will first be taught that                      certain (visual) stimuli go with other (visual) stimuli.  Later,                they will be tested to see if, as a result of that training, they               have learned that those stimuli belong to the same \"group\" or                   \"class.\"  To do this, they will be taught in a second phase to                  match new stimuli to some of the stimuli with which they were                   originally trained.  Then, their ability to match the remaining                 training stimuli to the new ones introduced in the second phase                 will be measured.  Successful performance during this latter                    (test) phase would show that pigeons, like humans, can form                     stimulus equivalences or stimulus classes.                                                                                                                      If this ability can be established, it would mean that human                    language is not necessary for this important behavioral                         attribute.  It would also encourage scientists to study more                    intensively in the laboratory just how this supposedly special                  human characteristic comes about.",
