 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study shock wave and other                           discontinuous solutions of the equations that govern the flow of                compressible fluids. For example, there are still many unanswered               questions regarding the role that dissipative mechanisms play in                the interaction of two or more shock waves and the long-time                    stability of such waves.  The principal investigators will use                  analytic and asymptotic tools to answer these questions and                     related ones.  In addition to the usual equations of fluid                      dynamics  the principal investigators will study systems of                     equations in magneto-hydrodynamics, the kinetic theory of gases,                and the theory of shallow water waves.                                               Dissipative forces like friction can be small in certain                   problems in fluid dynamics, but their effect cannot be neglected.               For example, the viscosity (internal friction) of a gas is very                 small and yet it affects the large-scale behavior of objects that               move through the gas.  The principal investigators will study how               such small dissipative mechanisms can influence the formation and               propagation of shock waves in gases.  A shock wave is something                 like a sonic boom, and it is an important feature of flows at                   high speeds.",
