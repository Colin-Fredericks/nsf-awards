 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  DNA nucleotide base sequence of a chloroplast gene will               be used to interpret phylogenetic relationships among the                       subclasses of the Liliopsida (i.e., the monocots).  This gene                   encodes the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate                          carboxylase (rbcL), part of the most abundant, and arguably, the                most important protein on earth.  Dr. Michael Clegg, Professor                  of Genetics at the University of California, Riverside, has                     agreed to sponsor this fellowship proposal.  The rbcL gene is a                 particularly appropriate choice because it is ubiquitous among                  photoautotrophs, because it exhibits sufficient divergence for                  use in broad phylogenetic investigations, and because a data base               of rbcL nucleotide sequences already exists which will be used in               conjunction with sequence data.  Contemporary sequencing                        technology permits the analysis of many species in a short period               of time by one investigator, especially in a laboratory in which                sequence analysis is conducted routinely, such as that of Dr.                   Clegg.  Total cellular DNA will be extracted, the rbcL gene will                be amplified in the polymerase chain reaction, and the nucleotide               sequence will be determined by standard techniques.  Sequence                   data will be analyzed to construct statistically supported                      dendrograms,  It is anticipated that this research will require                 two years of work and support:  14-16 months will be spent                      procuring plant materials and determining rbcL gene sequences,                  and the remaining time will be devoted to analysis of the data                  and phylogenetic interpretation.",
