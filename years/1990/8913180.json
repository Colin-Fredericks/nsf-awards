 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fossil vertebrate collections of the Museum of                         Paleontology, University of California, Berkeley, are among the                 world's most important.  These collections comprise more than                   140,000 catalogued specimens, and they provide one of the most                  complete representations of the history of the North American                   vertebrate fauna available today.  The University's Department of               Paleontology has recently become part of a new Department of                    Integrative Biology, and the collections will be moved into                     renovated quarters in the Life Sciences Building, along with the                Museum of Vertebrate Zoology.  Combining the zoology and                        paleontology faculties, and juxtaposing the fossil and Recent                   vertebrate collections, will make the new department a center for               the study of vertebrate evolution.  Dr. William Clemens will                    oversee the transfer of the collections to new compactorized                    storage areas.  Accessibility to specimens will be improved                     greatly, and the new quarters will support many years of                        continued collection growth.                                                         Collections of fossils are the libraries in which the                      history of life can be studied.  Growth and improvement of these                collections is vital to evolutionary studies, and to our                        understanding of the history of life on earth.  The proposed                    collection improvement will benefit paleontologists, geologists,                vertebrate zoologists, biogeographers, and evolutionary                         biologists around the world.",
