 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research applies asymptotic methods, involving expansions                  for large and small values of parameters appearing in                           differential equations, to the analysis of structures of                        flames in real combustible mixtures.  Through                                   nondimensionalization of the conservation equations, large and                  small parameters are identified. These parameters involve                       activation energies leading to activation-energy asymptotics,                   magnitudes of reaction rates leading to Damkohler-number                        asymptotics, and ratios of reaction rates leading to rate-                      ratio asymptotics.  Rate parameters for elementary steps are                    taken from the literature on reaction rate experiments.  The                    identification of limiting values of the parameters simplifies                  the conservation equations and enables solutions to be                          obtained largely analytically without resort to numerical                       integration of the full set of conservation equations.  The                     research will address structural differences between premixed                   flames and diffusion flames for hydrocarbon-oxygen-nitrogen                     systems for systems involving carbon monoxide, hydrogen and                     oxygen, as well as the intrinsic stability and influences of                    strain for these flames.  Special attention will be paid to                     the derivation and application of useful reduced schemes for                    hydrogen-oxygen systems, for systems containing halogens, for                   higher hydrocarbons, and possibly also for methanol.                                                                                                            The methods typically lead to formulas for the quantities of                    interest, such as burning velocities, and the formulas usually                  contain parameters determined by numerical integrations of                      two-point boundary-value problems for ordinary differential                     equations.  Since these differential equations are much                         simpler than the starting differential equations, full                          parametric solutions are obtained, rather than solutions                        restricted to specific conditions.  As a consequence, a better                  understanding of flame structure ensues, the essential aspects                  of the combustion processes are identified, and inessential                     complications that play no significant role are eliminated.",
