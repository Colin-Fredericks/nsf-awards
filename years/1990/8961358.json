The device exploits an innovative concept whereby the                           instrument detects the short wavelength radiation emitted from                                                                                                  ash particles present in the flow due to the combustion                         process.  This is opposed to conventional techniques which                                                                                                      detect long-wavelength infrared radiation, with appreciable                                                                                                     inaccuracy.  Prior thinking in this technology was that                         utilizing shorter wavelengths was not a fruitful direction to                                                                                                   pursue, however, PSI has performed an analysis which reveals                                                                                                    the potential of this approach and has confirmed it with                                                                                                        preliminary experiments.  The project will design and                           fabricate a sensor based on this principle, and the sensor                      will be characterized.  These results will be used to                           determine if the probe is adequate for transient furnace                        control applications.                                                                                                                                           The device to be developed will be of great use in furnace                                                                                                      control applications whereby coal-fired power plant boilers                                                                                                     might operate at optimum efficiency due to direct control of                                                                                                    the combustion process during varying loads, and incinerator                                                                                                    furnaces could be controlled to minimize environmental                          pollution.",
