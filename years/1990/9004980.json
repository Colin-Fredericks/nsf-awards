 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                          Chemistry Program.  It is a continuation of research in the                     same area.  Dr. Hoffman has developed the chemistry of a group                  of compounds that permits the highly flexible synthesis of                      number of important classes of structures such as amino acids                   and heterocycles.  These reactions have the potential to                        simplify the synthesis of otherwise difficultly obtainable                      substances.                                                                                                                                                     The use of 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds in synthesis has                    received considerable attention in recent years.  2-Sulfonyloxy                 carbonyl compounds (ketones and esters) can be prepared readily                 from enol derivatives of carbonyl compounds, and the                            sulfonyloxy group introduces distinct reactivity to the                         product.  Of greatest interest is that 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl                   compounds undergo very clean nucleophilic substitution.  This                   propensity has been exploited in simple 2-sulfonyloxy ketones                   and esters as a means to synthesize 2-substituted ketones and                   unusual amino acid esters.  The planned work involves the                       synthesis of selected, new 2-sulfonyloxy carbonyl compounds,                    and exploits their special reactivity for the preparation of                    densely functionalized products.  Three specific objectives are                 set: a) to develop methodology for the synthesis of chiral                      3-hydroxy-2-nosyloxy esters and their elaboration into chiral                   1,2,3-trifunctionalized compounds, b) to develop the use of                     unsaturated nosyloxy esters for the synthesis of unsaturated                    ester derivatives, and c) to continue studies on the                            electrophilic addition to enamine and enol derivatives of                       2-ketoesters.",
