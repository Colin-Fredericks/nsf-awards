 "awd_abstract_narration": "The unfertilized frog egg is radially symmetric abut its primary,               animal-vegetal axis, but events after fertilization lead to                     completely different developmental fates for various cytoplasmic                regions. The earliest steps in this regional specialization                     probably involve relocalization of components already present in                the egg. The aims of this project are to define the major                       cellular mechanisms whereby such determinants might be localized                in early Xenopus laevis embryogenesis and evaluate the                          developmental importance of those localizations. Two extensive                  rearrangements of the deep cytoplasm during early embryogenesis                 will be examined. The first of these movements occurs during the                first cell cycle, and appears to result from the directed                       translocation of the vegetal yolk mass- a complicated shift of                  ventral egg cytoplasm toward the prospective dorsal side. the                   second movement is an extensive ingression of subcortical                       cytoplasm along cleavage furrows during each early cell division.               These rearrangements will be followed in eggs in which yolk                     platelets in specific regions have been fluorescently labelled,                 to produce a 3-dimensional picture of egg cytoplasmic movements.                The importance of these rearrangements for specification of the                 embryonic body axis will be evaluated by comparing them in normal               and experimental embryos, the latter treated in a variety of ways               to disrupt normal cytoplasmic rearrangements.                                   %%%                                                                             How a radially symmetric egg develops into an adult with a                      dorsal/ventral and anterior/posterior axis is a fundamental                     question of developmental biology. These axes are set up very                   early in development. This study is to examine some of those very               early events that lead to axis formation.",
