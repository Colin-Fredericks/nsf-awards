This proposal plans to                            study the potential role of physiology in                                       \u001areproductive isolation between closely related                                 species.  They plan to use brown frogs, \u001aRana\u001a \u001asauteri\u001a,                       collected from three distinct altitudes in Taiwan                               to examine the potential role of physiology in                                  reproductive isolation to elucidate the relationship                            between speciation and reproductive isolating                                   mechanisms.  This proposal addresses an important                               problem in ecology and evolutionary biology.  The                               findings can have significant implications in                                   evolutionary theory and can advance our understanding                           of general mechanisms of speciation.  The                                       \u001aexperimental design is simple and the species                                  identified is uniquely appropriate to serve as an                               animal model for this study.  Taiwan is an excellent                            site for this study, since this is one of the few                               places where brown frogs are found distributed over                             such a large area and at different altitudes.",
