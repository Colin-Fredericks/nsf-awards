 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is designed to test the hypothesis that melatonin         binds to a cell surface receptor which, through an interaction with the         guanine nucleotide binding protein Gi, decreases cAMP production,               protein kinase activity, and protein phosophorylation to cause                  rearrangement of the cytoskelton and melanosome migration in cultured           amphibian melanophores.  Characterization of the molecular mechanism of         melatonin action in the amphibian melanophore, a simple and well                characterized cellular system with a demonstrable response to melatonin         treatment, will provide an important precedent that may lead to an              understanding of melatonin's mechanism of action in more complex                systems.  The proposed research is based upon the PI's finding that             pertussis toxin prevents melatonin action in amphibian melanophores and         upon an in vitro melanophore culture technology developed by the PI.            In the proposed research, melatonin-induced rearrangements of                   cytoskeletal components will be characterized, by studying fixed and            detergent permeabilized cells treated with fluorescent cytoskeleton             markers.  Melatonin-induced changes in protein phosphorylation will be          evaluated by employing SDS-PAGE to separate proteins incorporating              radiophosphate after melatonin treatment and by employing                       radioenzymatic analysis of protein kinase activities.  This research            will lead to an understanding of the molecular mechanism of melatonin           action which, in the long term, will suggest pharmacological approaches         for correcting biological rhythm disorders or for synchronizing                 biological rhythms to coincide with specific external events.",
