Lutterodt, Department of Mathematics, Howard University,                        and Dr. Patrick W. Darko, Department of Mathematics,                            University of Ghana, to pursue, for a period of 24 months,                      cooperative research on a rational approximation in                             strictly pseudoconvex domains.  They will study and attempt                     to resolve problems which have grown out of attempts to                         extend the generalization of the Montessus de Ballore                           theorem in a ball to other strictly pseudoconvex domains.                                                                                                       The field of several complex variables is a central one in                      modern mathematics with ties to differential geometry,                          physics, geometric measure theory, algebraic geometry, and                      others.  The two collaborators are well suited by training                      and previous research to engage in this research.  In                           addition to the immediate scientific benefits expected from                     this work, this project may help strengthen the research                        efforts in complex analysis at both of the cooperating                          institutions.  The U.S. PI will give seminars at the                            University of Ghana on his recent results in meromorphic                        approximations.  The research and these seminars have the                       potential for strengthening the S&T infrastructure in Ghana                     by stimulating in Ghanaian students an interest in                              mathematics research.  This project is relevant to the                          objectives of the Science in Developing Countries (SDC)                         Program which seeks to strengthen SDC scientific                                infrastructure and increase the level of cooperation                            between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                 counterparts in developing countries through the exchange                       of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques                        and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
