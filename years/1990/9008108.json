This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Donald I. Potter                     will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by                      Dr. Janet M. Hampikian to the CSIRO Division of Materials                       Science and Technology in Melbourne, Australia, to work under                   the direction of Dr. C. J. Rossouw on \"Defects and Locations                    of Reactive Elements in Chromia\" to shed new light on the                       mechanisms causing the reduction in oxidation kinetics of                       chromia-forming alloys due to reactive element additions.                       Many high temperature alloys rely on the formation of a                         protective layer of chromia.  A decrease in chromia scale                       growth, corresponding to an increase in part lifetime, is one                   of the effects of reactive element additions to these alloys.                   This proposal focuses on determining the role that these                        reactive element dopants play in the chromia lattice.                           Specifically, the researchers will establish the type of                        point defect that controls diffusion in undoped chromia, as                     well as the position of the dopants.  To accomplish this,                       they will channel enhanced microanalysis and statistical                        analysis of electron channeling microanalytic data.                                                                                                             The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
