 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional biochemical approaches have been largely unsuccessful               in the study of the membrane-bound enzymes involved in lipid                    metabolism.  The characterization of mutants of Arabidopsis                     deficient in lipid biosynthesis provides opportunities to clone                 the genes involved without first purifying the corresponding                    proteins.  Chromosome walking will undoubtedly be successful, but               this approach requires a very large amount of effort for each                   gene cloned.  This project determines whether any mutants in                    lipid metabolism can be identified in a population of 1,800                     Arabidopsis lines containing stably integrated T-DNA inserts.                   When a mutation is found and shown to cosegregate with the                      kanamycin resistance marker located in the T-DNA, then a                        substantial effort to complete the cloning and characterization                 of the gene is justified.                                                                                                                                       Fatty acid unsaturation is a determinant of the quality and                     economic value of the product from oilseed crop species.  Because               of the importance of unsaturated fatty acids in human health, it                would be advantageous to be able to control the degree of                       unsaturation of the lipids in these species.  A crucial step                    toward this goal is to understand the molecular basis of                        desaturation.  This research provides for this by identifying                   fatty acid mutants to be used for the isolation and cloning of                  genes encoding the enzymes responsible for desaturation.  This                  further allows for the development of strategies to alter                       usefully the fatty acid composition of vegatable oils.",
