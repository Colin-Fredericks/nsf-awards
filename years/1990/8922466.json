 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      John Kessler, University of Arizona and Professor T.J.                          Pedley, Department of Applied Mathematics,  University of                       Leeds, England.  The objective of the proposed project is an                    investigation of the molecular basis of actomyosin-based                        cell motility in non-muscle cells.                                                                                                                              The investigators will focus on individual and collective                       dynamics of swimming organisms, especially algal cells.  The                    geometry of their swimming paths is due to torque exerted by                    gravity and shear, which orient the organisms' bodies.  Cells                   also respond to the direction and intensity of illumination                     and to random impulses.  The physical parameters which                          couple orientation to shear and gravity torques are not                         accurately known.  Magnitudes derived from theory are                           adequate to model the cooperative behavior of large populations                 of micro-swimmers, but there are no direct measurements on                      individual cell trajectories.  Furthermore, essentially                         nothing is known about sensory orientation and its quantitative                 competition with  physical orienting mechanisms.  The chief                     object of this project is to develop an apparatus, from                         design to prototype, for measuring the dependence of cell                       orientation on shear rate on the direction of gravity, and of                   illumination.  This apparatus will be used to provide                           quantitative experimental values for insertion in the                           equations which describe individual swimming trajectories and                   also the patterns which develop as a result of the collective                   interactions of swimming organisms.  This cooperative effort                    will benefit from the complementary expertise of Dr. Kessler                    in physics and the ecology of motile algae, and of Dr. Pedley                   in applied mathematics and physiological flows.  The results                    of this research will find application in the theory of                         active suspensions, in microbial ecology, and in the                            quantification of cellular sensory responses.",
