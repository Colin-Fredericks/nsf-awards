 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to purchase multi-user                             instrumentation for biomolecular processing, purification and                   analysis.  An Automated Laboratory Workstation would assist                     processing DNA sequencing reactions.  A High Performance Gel                    Electrophoresis Unit, a Synthetic Peptide Preparative                           Purification System, and a Biomolecule Preparative Purification                 System would accomplish a wide range of macromolecule                           purifications.  A Solution Analytical Capillary Electrophoresis                 Unit would permit advanced detection of biomolecules for a wide                 range of research needs.  The main users would be researchers in                the Colleges of Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, and Medicine, and               the Arizona Research Laboratories at the University of Arizona.                 The instruments will be housed in the Macromolecular Structure                  Facility established by the Division of Biotechnology.  Skilled                 prsonnel will operate, maintain and train other users.  The                     specific research that would be enhanced by these instruments                   includes:  the molecular biological basis for cell                              differentiation and morphology; plant gene expression; plant                    responses to environmental stresses (salt, low water,,heat); RNA                processing, protein transport and gene expression in chlorplasts;               cyanelle molecular biology; expression of insect proteases                      inhibitors; insect endocrinology; structure/function studies of                 insect proteins; insect protein and lipid biochemistry; total                   immune system evolution; peptide/protein conformational                         constraints and receptor recognition; biopolymer/Ligand                         interactions; and chromatography support design.",
