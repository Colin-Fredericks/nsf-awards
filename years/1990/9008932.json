 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this travel award is to allow three American                     specialists in the tectonics of extreme northern regions -                      Dr. Kazuya Fujita of Michigan State University and Drs. John                    N. Davies and David B. Stone of the University of Alaska at                     Fairbanks - to visit the U.S.S.R. in July 1990 to determine                     the feasibility of conducting long-term U.S.-U.S.S.R. coopera-                  tive research on tectonic rifting and deformational processes                   in northeastern Siberia.  The lead Soviet institution, the                      Institute of Geology of the Siberian Division (Yakut Branch)                    of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Yakutsk, has arranged                      for the American team to make a field trip to one of the                        potential research sites along the remote Indigirka river.  In                  addition to offering the opportunity of visiting previously                     inaccessible research sites, this study could result in                         seismological and paleomagnetic data that could be invaluable                   in supporting or invalidating current models of the tectonic                    evolution of the Arctic.                                                                                                                                        This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                                                                                                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                                                                                                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
