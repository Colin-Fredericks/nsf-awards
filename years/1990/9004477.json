 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tubulin plays a crucial role in morphogenesis as the primary                    component of microtubules.  We propose to address two basic                     questions about these important structural proteins using the four              a-tubulins of Drosophila: are any of the a-tubulin isotypes                     functionally specialized, and what regulatory mechanisms are                    responsible for achieving the correct ratios and concentrations of              a-tubulins isotypes in each cell type?  The multifunctionality of               each a-tubulin isotype will be tested by determining the ability                of one isotype to rescue developmental defects associated with                  mutations in another isotype.  Transgenic strains carrying ectopic              copies of each a-tubulin gene and mutations in two of the a-                    tubulins are available.  An attempt will be made to generate                    mutations in the two remaining genes using P-element mutagenesis                and PCR, an approach that allows the recovery of mutations with no              detectable phenotype.  Regulatory mechanisms operating to maintain              tissue-appropriate a-tubulin pools will be identified by examining              the ability of cells to 1) eliminate misexpressed a-tubulin                     isotypes produced from chimeric genes, and 2) respond to                        overexpression of appropriate isotypes from supernumerary tubulin               genes.  Genes encoding transacting a-tubulin regulatory factors                 will be sought by reverting the female sterility associated with                overexpression of a maternal tubulin.                                                                                                                           The protein tubulin is an important structural component of most                types of cells.  It exists in a number of different forms, some                 present in all cells, others present only in certain specialized                types of cells.  The different forms of tubulin presumably serve                different functions, but very little is known about what these                  functions are.  This is a proposal to investigate the different                 functions of the different forms of tubulin.",
