This conference is                    scheduled to be held June 17-22, 1990 at the Vermont Academy in                 Saxton's River, VT.  The field of retinoid research has expanded                in the last decade to include scientists from diverse areas.  The               major goal of this conference is to provide a common forum to                   scientists from different countries and backgrounds to learn                    about the latest developments in retinoid research and share                    their ideas with colleagues.  This is particularly important for                junior researchers who are finding productive and stimulating                   environments for their future endeavors.  The conference will                   provide a poster discussion session to maximize active                          participation by junior researchers.                                                                                                                            Research on retinoids is important for understanding cell                       communication, development and differentiation, phototransduction               in vision, and regulation of gene expression.  This conference                  will provide the opportunity for researchers working in these                   diverse areas to discuss their common concerns and develop new                  approaches that will increase basic knowledge of the function of                these important biological molecules.",
