 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop an                    understanding of the factors that affect the energy costs of                    existence and costs of transport in six species of ants.  These                 insects have served as an empirical basis for economic models of                foraging and territorial defense; however quantitative tests of                 such models have been limited by the absence of comparative data                on actual energy costs.                                                              Using sensitive computer-assisted sampling techniques                      developed in the laboratory, the investigators plan to measure                  the metabolic rate of individual ants at rest and actively                      exercising.  They will examine the effects on energy cost of such               ecologically relevant variables as 1) body mass, 2) ambient                     temperature, 3) running speed, and 4) load mass and mode of                     carriage.  The first comparative data on ventilation patterns in                exercising insects will be gathered.  The goal is to provide, for               the first time, a comprehensive body of data on the energy                      transactions of an ecologically important group of small insects.               Results of the study will allow ecologists to accurately estimate               energy costs from a few easily measured environmental variables.                Such an ability should encourage more quantitative tests of                     ecological theory based on economic models.                                          In addition to these contributions to basic science, the                   proposed research should have several practical applications,                   The work to date has made several technical advances in the                     analysis of gas exchange in small insects, including the                        development of software and instrumentation.  The detailed                      analysis of gaits in ants may prove useful in small machine                     robotics.  In addition, data from the study will help applied                   ecologists estimate changes in energy flow due to habitat                       alteration in desert ecosystems.",
