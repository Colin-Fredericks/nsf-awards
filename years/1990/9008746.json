 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate large-scale                    \"buffer-focusing\" chromatgraphy in which a precisely                            controlled, internal pH gradient traveling much more slowly                     than the fluid velocity is used to simultaneously concentrate                   and purify dilute mixtures of biomolecules.  The internal pH                    gradient is characterized by a low salt concentration, a high                   buffer capacity, and is produced using multicomponent mixtures                  of common amphoteric and non-amphoteric buffer compounds of                     defined chemical composition.  Each of the buffer compounds                     interacts with the column by adsorption or through acid-base                    reactions.  Reliable methods for producing internal pH                          gradients (e.g., criteria for selecting buffer compounds, type                  of sorbent, starting and final pH, column dimensions, and                       particle size) are to be developed using numerical simulations                  and ancillary experiments.  The use of buffer-focusing                          chromatography to separate model mixtures of proteins is also                   to be investigated theoretically and experimentally.                                                                                                            The results from this work can be used to evaluate buffer-                      focusing chromatography as an efficient, gently (i.e. non-                      denaturing) alternative to conventional large-scale methods                     for concentrating and purifying dilute mixtures of                              biomolecules.",
