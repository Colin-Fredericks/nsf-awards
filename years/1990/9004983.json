 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of these studies is to learn about the control of plant                cell differentiation. Utilizing epidermal cell redifferentiation                into parenchyma during postgenital carpel fusion in Catharanthus                roseus to pursue these studies. During normal floral ontogeny in                C. roseus, approximately 400 epidermal cells are induced to                     rapidly redifferentiate during the postgenital fusion of the two                carpel primordia. Dr. Verbeke has previously reported experiments               involving the placement of water permeable and water impermeable                barriers between prefusion carpels which implicate a diffusible                 agent as the morphogen for redifferentiation. This proposal                     continues Dr. Verbeke's characterization of communication factors               that convey positional information to plant epidermal cells.                    Specifically she will focus on the following questions: 1) Are                  the two carpels producing distinct factors, a combination of                    which are essential for redifferentiation? 2) What are the                      physical characteristics of these factors? 3) What are the                      chemical characteristics of these factors? and 4) How universal                 are the factors?                                                                %%%                                                                             The mechanisms by which patterns of discrete cell types are                     formed in response to their position is a long standing problem                 in developmental biology. A cell that reacts in a special way in                consequence of association with another must do so because it                   acquires \"information\" from that other, information that must be                conveyed through chemical or physical signals. These experiments                continue a characterization of communication factors that convey                positional information to plant epidermal cells.",
