 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops the theory of thermal shock phenomena                                                                                                    induced by a rapidly moving heat source or a propagating crack                                                                                                  tip, (a moving origin) for a two- and three-dimensional                         situations.  The emphases are placed on the effects of a free                                                                                                   surface and an interface between dissimilar materials.  A                       thermal Mach number (M) weighing the ratio of the speed of the                                                                                                  moving origin (v) to the heat propagation speed (C) in the                      solid is introduced to characterize the thermal shock                           phenomena.  Mathematically, M = v/C.  In the subsonic range                     with M < 1, detailed comparisons with the classical diffusion                                                                                                   theory will be made to reveal the limitations of the Fourier's                                                                                                  law in describing the thermal response of the material under                                                                                                    high rates.  At the transonic stage with M = 1 and in the                       supersonic range with M > 1, the salient features to be                         studied include the formation of the thermal shock waves,                       evolution of the heat affected zone versus the thermally                        undisturbed zone in the physical domain, discontinuous                          variations of the thermodynamic quantities across the shock                     surfaces, reflection and refraction patterns of the thermal                     shock waves when penetrating through the material interface,                                                                                                    and the swinging phenomena for the variations of the                            temperature level around the moving origin with the thermal                     Mach number in transition from the subsonic to the supersonic                                                                                                   ranges.  The theory also has direct application to                              thermoelastic displacement potentials and to thermal stress                     fields.  Both temperature- and flux-formulations will be                        examined for the proposed phenomena, and an analytical method                                                                                                   involving the hypo-variable transformations will be employed                                                                                                    throughout the analysis.",
