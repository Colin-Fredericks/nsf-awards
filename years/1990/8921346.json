 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past decade, discussions of the role of government policy                have changed rather dramatically.  At one time, discussions of                  policy held out independent and significant roles for both                      monetary and fiscal policy to influence both business cycles and                economic growth.  In recent years, the role of government policy                in general and monetary policy in particular is seen as much more               limited.  Much of the research on business cycles has been framed               in the context of models where business cycles occur as the                     result of technology shocks in models that are free of                          distortions of any kind.  Thus, the cause of the cycle is real in               origin.  A separate but related strand of literature has examined               the process of growth in a new light, using new techniques, but                 abstracting from any concrete role for government policy.  The                  purpose of this project is to analyze the role of government, ie.               monetary and fiscal policy, in the context of a real business                   cycle model.  In particular, the effects of policy on the                       statistical properties of aggregate time series and societal                    welfare are analyzed.  This research is important because it will               provide a better understanding of the relative roles of real and                monetary factors in affecting economic fluctuations and long term               growth.",
