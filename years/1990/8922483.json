 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solid state                   chemistry between Dr. Juana Acrivos, San Jose State Univesity                   and Dr. Y. W. Liang, Director, IRC Laboratory for Supercon-                     ductivity, Cambridge University, U.K.  The project involves the                 investigation of the effects that the composition (as varied                    by intercalation) has on the properties of low dimensional                      solids.                                                                                                                                                         The objective of the research is to prepare new materials                       with special properties.  The products obtained by interca-                     lation reactions are usually materials containing the same                      element with multiple valence; this property is evident in                      electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance                       (NMR), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements and                     electronic and vibrational spectra.  For superconductors, the                   investigators have developed a new technique of rf power                        dissipation measurements.  The systems under investigation                      include metal in ammonia solutions near the metal to insulator                  transition and compounds containing the same element in at                      least two different valence states.  Of great interest today                    are the low dimensional superconducting solids containing the                   same element in multiple valence states, e.g., intercalated                     layer materials where there is partial charge transfer from                     the host to the adduct, one dimensional organic conductors                      and ceramic high temperature superconductors.  All these                        materials are important in the elucidation of the role that                     structure plays on oxidation-reduction mechanisms.  These                       materials are used for developing high duty batteries,                          catalysts, solid lubricants and new types of conductors. The                    project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the                    two investigators and well as their past history of fruitful                    collaboration. Dr. Acrivos is considered one of the world                       leaders in research on the chemistry and electronic properties                  of low-dimensional solids.",
