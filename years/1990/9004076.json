 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will expand upon his recent                     discovery of new homotopy-theoretic structures on complex                       surfaces.  This interdisciplinary project involves the use of                   algebraic topology to understand the structure of the solution                  space of certain systems of nonlinear partial differential                      equations which appear naturally in differential geometry and                   mathematical physics.  Additionally, he will investigate several                problems involving iterated loop space structures.                                   Two shapes are homotopic if closed loops on them have                      identical collapsing properties.  For example, a circle and the                 shape of a solid coffee mug (with one handle) are homotopy                      equivalent.  But if the mug were to have two handles or no                      handles, it would not be homotopy equivalent to a circle.  This                 concept has been explored by mathematicians for over a hundred                  years, but its use in problems related to mathematical physics                  has been a recent phenomena.  The principal investigator will                   contribute to this growing interdisciplinary activity.",
