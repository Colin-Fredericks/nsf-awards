 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution acquired a Fourier                        Transform Infrared (FAIR) Spectrometer which markedly improved                  the instructional program in Chemistry at the college.  The                     improvements included:  (1) doubling the number of experiments                  using infrared spectroscopy in the curriculum.  The new level of                exposure to infrared spectral interpretation has been ideal for                 the training of students in this key technique.  (2) For the                    first time, students have been able to learn and use the                        important concepts of signal averaging and Fourier transform                    spectroscopy.  (3) The purchase of diffuse reflectance sampling                 accessory for the FAIR allowed easy and rapid study of solid                    samples with infrared spectroscopy.  (4) The excitement of modern               scientific instrumentation has been transmitted to introductory                 level students, both majors and non-majors.  These efforts have                 built on the department's successful incorporation of advanced                  instruments in first year courses, and have extended to courses                 which had no usage of modern instrumentation.                                                                                                                   The curricular improvements include all branches of chemistry,                  and have benefitted students ranging from precollege level to                   senior chemistry majors doing independent research projects.                                                                                                    The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
