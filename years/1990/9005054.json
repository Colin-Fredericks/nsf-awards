 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous studies of the Miocene Hawthorn Group of the Florida                   Platform indicate that phosphogenesis occurred primarily during                 the early to early middle Miocene.  The timing of Phosphogenesis                appears to be synchronous with a global positive excursion of the               carbon isotopic composition (delta13C) of seawater.  Preliminary                examination of the Hawthorn in northeastern Florida shows that                  these sediments are rich in phosphorite, dolomite, silica and                   other minerals indicative of intense upwelling, but contain                     little organic carbon or pyrite.  Burial of isotopically light                  carbon by deposition of organic-rich, continental margin                        sequences in the SE U.S. during the early Miocene likely resulted               in a global increase in the delta C of seawater.  Multiple                      reworking and supergene weathering from subaerial exposure after                the middle middle Miocene oxidized and removed most of the                      organic carbon and diagenetic pyrite.  Rapid oxidation of the                   buried organic carbon resulted in the delta C of seawater                       returning to its pre-excursion value.  We will test this                        hypothesis by determining the mechanism and timing of                           phosphogenesis, the timing of sediment oxidation, and the                       relationship of these events on the Florida Platform to global                  sea-level changes and variations in the delta C and delta O of                  seawater during the Miocene.  The research program relies on                    integrating the seismic sequence stratigraphy, sediment                         mineralogy and texture, and elemental and isotopic composition of               the phosphorite and associate minerals.  The Sr isotope                         stratigraphy of the Hawthorn sections will be compared to the                   delta C, delta O, and Sr isotope stratigraphy of the Miocene                    sediments from the southwest Pacific (DSDP Site 588).",
