 "awd_abstract_narration": "In higher plants, the mechanism by which potassium is                           transported across the plasma membrane is uncertain.  Results                   from electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest a                     model in which a proton pump (H+ -ATPase) generates a proton                    electrochemical gradient which drives potassium uptake                          through potassium carriers and channels.  By isolating and                      characterizing mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana with altered                     potassium transport, this model is being tested.  Preliminary                   experiments indicate that cesium is a phytotoxic competitive                    inhibitor of potassium uptake in A. thaliana seedlings.  From                   100,000 M2 seed, several dozen cesium-resistant A. thaliana                     mutant plants were isolated and many display a defect in                        potassium transport.  The mutants showed two broad phenotypic                   groupings, one which is pleiotropic in that potassium and                       phosphate transport are both affected, and a second in which                    a specific alteration has occurred in the affinity of the                       transport system for potassium.  The second set of mutants is                   being characterized genetically.  In order to clone and                         sequence genes encoding plasma membrane potassium                               transporters, a chromosome walk to loci of uptake mutants                       with altered affinities for potassium is being performed.                                                                                                       Potassium plays a special role in the life of plant cells.                      The accumulation of high concentrations of this ion drives                      the uptake of water without an increase in cell volume                          because the plasma membrane is restrained in its expansion by                   a rigid cell wall.  Thus, the main function for accumulated                     potassium appears to be the generation and maintenance of a                     large turgor pressure.  In higher plants this pressure plays                    an especially important role in providing the driving force                     for erect plant growth through cell elongation.  The                            concentration of potassium in the cytoplasm of cells is                         maintained even when the extracellular concentration is                         reduced to extremely low levels.  It has long been recognized                   that the generation and maintenance of this large potassium                     gradient requires metabolic energy.  This research explores                     the molecular mechanism for potassium transport across the                      plasma membrane of plants in order to gain a better                             understanding of how this important plant mineral functions                     in plant growth and development.***//",
