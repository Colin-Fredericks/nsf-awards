 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of mini-supercomputers provides theoreticans with                       computing performance equal to that of large mainframe                          computers.  Theoretical chemistry computations give both a                      quantitative description of the energetics and rates of                         elementary chemical reactions and also provides a qualitative                   understanding of the fundamental factors governing chemical                     changes.  Most of these studies would not have been possible                    before the acquisition of the mini-supercomputer because the                    cost on the central mainframe computers or the computer time                    required would have been prohibitive.  The applications of                      mini-computers are found in Theoretical Studies of Chemical                     Reactions.                                                                                                                                                      This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University                   to acquire a new departmental computer system.  The areas of                    chemical research that the acquisition will impact are the                      following:                                                                                                                                                      1.  Carbon-Hydrogen Bond Activation and the Agostic Hydrogen                                                                                                    2.
