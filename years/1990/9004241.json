 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cordillera Darwin complex in southern Chile exposes high               grade metamorphic rocks in close proximity to rocks of                          considerably lower grade across the Beagle Canal.  Recent models                suggest that the high grade rocks form the core of an extensional               \"metamorphic core complex\" and their exposure was accommodated by               large-scale tectonic denudation.  This project is a continuation                of a petrographic and age dating effort to test this model by                   assembly of PTt paths and radiometric dating techniques.  Data                  collected so far are consistent with the proposed structural                    models, but are not sufficiently robust or abundant to                          unambiguously constrain them.  The purpose of this renewal is to                document additional PT paths from both high and low grade                       localities and to collect age data to constrain particularly the                early cooling history.  Results are expected to place tight                     constraints on the pressure (depth), temperature and time                       evolution of this area that will allow a thorough test of the                   extensional core complex theory.",
