 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hawaiian Islands possess one of the most distinctive                   floras in the world.  Because of its rich biodiversity and                      extreme geographic isolation, the Hawaiian archipelago is often                 praised as an ideal locality in which to study the patterns and                 processes of organic evolution.  However, much of Hawaii's unique               flora is endangered because of habitat conversion by humans and                 introduced animals and through the invasion of alien, weedy plant               competitors.  Fragmentation of forest habitat in particular may                 reduce the effective number of mature plants able to reproduce in               the wild.  There is a critical need, therefore, for studies which               not only address evolutionary questions but also obtain data                    useful to the wise stewardship of Hawaii's plant resources.                          In a project relevant to the conservation biology of native                Hawaiian ferns, Dr. Thomas Ranker of the University of Hawaii                   will employ enzyme electrophoresis to describe levels and                       patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations of 24                species of native Hawaiian ferns.  Levels of outcrossing and                    inbreeding among the tiny gametophytes of these species will be                 analyzed by examining natural stands of fern sporophytes as well                as by sampling natural and laboratory populations of selected                   gametophytes.  For species of the endemic genera Adenophorus and                Sadleria, gametophytes will be grown in the laboratory and tested               for factors affecting reproductive capacity and outcrossing                     behavior.   Comparisons will be made between wide-ranging, common               species and narrowly distributed, rare ones, and correlations                   sought with amounts of genetic variation and apportionment of                   this variation within populations or among scattered populations.               These data are pertinent to management decisions regarding                      effective population sizes for maintaining genetic variation and                overall diversity in the Hawaiian fern flora.",
