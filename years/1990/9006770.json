 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies have made progress in determining how, when,                and to what extent zooplankton, especially calanoid copepods, use               taste to discriminate between food particles which differ in                    nutritional quality.  The first goal of this proposal is to                     develop mechanistic models of algal consumption which integrate                 the effects of taste and size selective feeding.  The second goal               is to use Diaptomus and Daphnia as models for testing the                       implications of contrasting feeding modes for grazer-                           phytoplankton interactions and zooplankton competition.                              These basic problems will be attacked using field and                      laboratory experiments representing a range of time scales and                  degrees of experimental control.  Food selection experiments will               focus on a new question: concentration-variable selection and                   ingestion of large, difficult-to-handle phytoplankton by                        behaviorally flexible grazers.  Both short and long-term grazer                 manipulation will be used to compare and contrast the impacts of                grazing by Diaptomus and Daphnia on natural phytoplankton                       assemblages.  The possibility of positive interactions through                  complementary feeding niches (\"indirect mutualism\"), a                          potentially important stabilizing factor in zooplankton                         communities, will be tested for the first time through growth and               competition experiments with Diaptomus and Daphnia.//",
