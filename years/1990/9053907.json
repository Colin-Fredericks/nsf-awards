The institution has an excellent track             record of faculty research on technology aids for the disabled and              an information dissemination regarding science education for the                disabled.  The State Department of Public Instruction has a network             of regional education centers to promote support services to local              schools.  An additional network, in place, is the Rural Education               Institute at the University.  The strengths of the project are its              innovation and its potential for dissemination and replication.//",
