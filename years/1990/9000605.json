 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large size and rapid growth of kelp is due, at least in part,               to their ability to optimize growth under a variety of light                    conditions through changes in photosynthetic performance.  This                 feature may be most pronounce in one arctic species, Laminaria                  solidungula, which increases its annual production by more than                 half over 8-months of continuous ice cover when irradiance levels               are lowest.  Reported open-water saturation irradiance in this                  occurs during the summer, a period of minimal growth, when                      dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations are lowest.                   The project will test the hypothesis that photosynthetic                        sensitivity in L. solidungula increases considerably during the                 ice-covered period, and that ambient increases in DIN, not low                  levels of irradiance, are primarily responsible for seasonal                    changes in the plant's photosynthetic performance.  Several                     photosynthetic parameters will be calculated from photosynthetic                irradiance (P-I) curves derived from radioactive carbon uptake                  and oxygen flux measurements, and the light harvesting                          characteristics of entire plants incubated in situ in Beaufort                  Sea.  In the lab, photosynthetic parameters of individuals grown                under different conditions of light and DIN over a four-month                   period will be compared to specifically address the role of these               factors in regulating winter photosynthesis at low light levels.                In addition, the photosynthetic response of L. saccharina, which                is common in temperate regions but is relatively rare in the                    central Alaskan Beaufort Sea, will be compared to that of L.                    solidungula.  Studies of photosynthesis in both species under                   natural conditions of light and nutrient limitation will enhance                our understanding of photoadaptation and will greatly improve                   our ability to accurately model kelp production from measurements               of in situ irradiance.",
