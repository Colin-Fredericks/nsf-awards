 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Richard N. Zare is supported by a grant from The                      Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study state-to-state                 reaction dynamics using a combination of molecular beam and                     laser spectroscopic techniques.  This research is of                            fundamental importance in understanding the physics underlying                  simple chemical transformations at the molecular level.                                                                                                         The objective of Zare's research program is to obtain quantum                   state-specific information on the dynamics of elementary                        gas-phase chemical reactions.  This is accomplished through the                 synthesis of molecular beam and laser spectroscopic methods.                    Beam techniques permit the study of isolated molecules and the                  investigation of reactive encounters, one collision at a time.                  Laser techniques permit the preparation of reagents (state                      selection) and the interrogation of reaction products (state                    detection).  Special emphasis is placed on experiments that use                 a tunable infrared source or stimulated Raman pumping for                       preparing reagents in individual rovibronic states and use                      tunable UV sources for the quantum-state-specific detection of                  molecular and atomic products.  State-to-state information                      gathered in this manner enables chemists to understand how                      reactions occur by relating detailed observations to scattering                 calculations carried out on realistic potential energy surfaces                 that describe the forces experienced by reagents and products                   during a chemical transformation.",
