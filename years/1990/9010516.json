 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop semi-parametric                      methods for the estimation of sample selection models.  These                   methods will allow for the simultaneous estimation of choice                    equations and outcome equations.  In addition to the estimation                 of the two equations sample-selection models, the estimation of                 more complicated sample-selection models will also be considered.               All of these models have certain features in common, but they                   also have structures of their own.  Such structures impose                      specific identification restrictions on the models.  This project               will develop semi-parametric estimation methods which explore the               systematic structures of the models.  Some of the systematic                    estimation methods to be investigated are the semi-parametric                   likelihood methods.  Monte Carlo experiments will be performed to               investigate the small sample performance of the proposed                        estimators.   This research is important because sample-selection               models have many important applications, such as in the analysis                of job-search behavior, and the methods to be developed will                    permit for better estimating these and other models.",
