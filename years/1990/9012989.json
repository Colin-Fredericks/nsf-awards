 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research supports a project               to implement the Number Field Sieve, the newest method for                      factoring large integers. The principal investigators are                       Professor Robert Robson of the Mathematics Department and                       Professor Walter Rudd of the Computer Science Department at                     Oregon State University, and Professor Joe Buhler of Reed                       College. The Number Field Sieve has a predicted running time that               is so much better than that of the previously known methods of                  factoring that the Principal Investigators believe that they will               be able to factor numbers in the 145-digit range, far larger than               has been possible up to now.                                                         Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                  the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                    mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                     furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the               fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most                recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                  appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory. In                  particular, the difficulty or ease of factoring large numbers has               turned out to have a direct application to the security of                      public-key codes.",
