 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Lie groups and Lie                     algebras of Professor Ronald Irving of the University of                        Washington. Dr. Irving's project is to study certain algebraic                  topics underlying recent work in the representation theory of                   complex semisimple Lie algebras and real reductive Lie groups.                  Many important representations in Lie theory have finite length                 and lie in categories of finite length modules. These categories                carry a great deal of additional algebraic structure, such as                   translation functors or a filtered character theory. Professor                  Irving will study these features and their consequences in                      greater detail.                                                                      Any time there are operations that may be undone as well as                done, there is a group present. Groups were first studied                       systematically in the last century, and when the Norwegian                      mathematician Sophus Lie showed that group theory applied in a                  very natural way to the study of differential equations, the                    strength and significance of group theory became recognized by                  all mathematicians. The work supported here is a modern                         continuation of that first pioneering work of Lie.",
