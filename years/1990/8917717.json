 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Van Altena will continue his Southern Proper Motion (SPM)                   program.  These are second epoch observations, the first epoch data             were obtained between 1965 and 1974, which are taken at the Yale                Southern Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina.  The goal of the                project is to determine the absolute proper motions of stars with               respect to faint galaxies.  The 20-year difference in the two data              sets should result in highly accurate measurements of proper                    motions.  The absolute proper motions will be used to determine the             absolute magnitudes of RR Lyrae stars, corrections to the constants             of precession, a fixed reference frame for the HIPPARCOS                        astrometric satellite, Oort's constant B, and to study the local                structure of the Galaxy.                                                                                                                                        The problems associated with establishing an inertial reference                 frame have occupied astronomers for millenia.  With the passage of              time and improvements in measurement techniques, it was discovered              that the stars are not fixed in the sky and that it is necessary                to separate the motions of the stars from that of the Earth's pole.             This separation is currently made through the observation of Solar              System objects such as the Sun, the planets, and minor planets.                 However, some of the Solar System observations are made in modes                that differ significantly from those used in normal stellar                     observatons, and this difference may compromise the connection                  between the dynamically defined reference frame and the stellar                 frame.  As a result, astronomers are left with star streams, moving             groups, and non-circular motions in the Galaxy to complicate the                stellar motion model and the derivation of the corrections to the               constants of precession.  The initial impetus for determining                   proper motions with respect to faint galaxies was to determine the              corrections to the constants of precession and thereby improve on               the system of the fundamental catalogs.",
