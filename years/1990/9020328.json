 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a detailed,                        quantitative, experimentally verified model of the chip breaking                process using high pressure, two-phase coolant.  The chip control               system injects this high pressure, two-phase stream of cutting                  fluid into the chip formation zone.  The fluid stream breaks the                forming chip into short segments.  While this process is                        relatively simple in practice, the details of it are not known.                 The research is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding                 of this new chip control scheme by postulating an appropriate                   model.  The analytical model will relate the chip breaking                      process to machining and chip control system conditions.  The end               result of this research will be an experimentally verified model                which can be used to predict broken chip length given work                      material properties, cutting conditions, and coolant and coolant                flow characteristics.                                                                Further, the experimental work will include measurements of                machined surface finish and cutting tool wear.  These results                   will be useful in themselves and will also indicate the extent of               the effects of the chip control system on the chip formation                    process.",
