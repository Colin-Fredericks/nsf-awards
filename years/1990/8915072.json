 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research on the geophysics of                   Argentine and Antarctic margins to be conducted by John                         LaBrecque of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory at                       Columbia University and Marta Ghidella of the Antarctic                         Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  This work will extend                    studies of the pre-Jurassic reconstructions of the conjugate                    margins of the Antarctic Weddell basin and the southern edge                    of South America.  The procedure will be to compare magnetic                    and gravitational anomalies on both sides of the South                          Atlantic in Africa and South America to define the                              reconstruction of the prerift continent.  Current information                   suggests that the Weddell and South American margins are                        conjugate rift margins but data is lacking for the Weddell                      side.  This study will help provide such data through dipping                   seismic reflector measurements which can indicate thick                         accumulations of volcanically thickened oceanic crust.  These                   will be correlated with high amplitude magnetic anomalies.                      The results will be shed further light on the theory of the                     breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana.                                                                                                                         In this study, the U.S. side will benefit from logistic                         support in Argentina, access to new data sets, and general                      advancement of geophysical science.  They bring advanced                        scientific computing and improved instrumentation as additional                 benefits to the collaboration.  The result will be an                           expanded data base for this sector of the southern oceans and                   encouragement for the U.S.-Argentine joint geophysical effort                   in Antarctic research.",
