 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his important work on                  the partial differential equations that arise in various areas of               continuum mechanics.  In particular, he will apply advanced                     mathematical tools to study the general theory of multiphase                    thermomechanics as it relates to interfacial dynamics and                       phenomena involving melting and freezing.  He will also                         investigate some unusual partial differential equations that are                found in flows through porous media and in biological dispersal.                The work of the principal investigator concerns the development                 and study of mathematical models that attempt to describe such                  complicated physical phenomena as the growth of crystals with                   facets and corners, the evolution of a melting-freezing wave, and               more generally the creation of ordered structures in media                      through the action of curved fronts that move through the media.                As an example, think of trying to describe quantitatively what                  happens if you draw a hot wire through a block of ice.  It is a                 complicated process involving melting and re-freezing,  which is                difficult to study because the boundary between the melted and                  unmelted ice is so sensitive to the temperature of the wire and                 other factors.",
