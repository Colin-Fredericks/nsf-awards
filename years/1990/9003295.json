 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Human Genome Project burst upon the scene in the 1985.  Since               then, it has been a major topic of debate among life scientists.                The Genome Project is often touted as the first foray into Big                  Biology -- a biological equivalent to the Apollo and Manhattan                  Projects.  While much of this is mere hyperbole, proposing to                   examine human genetics at the cellular, organismal, and population              levels is nonetheless audacious.  The specific components of genome             projects -- genetic maps, physical maps, DNA sequence information,              and tools to produce and analyze these -- will be useful for the                future study of human biology and pathology.  The techniques and                instruments will be applicable to the study of all organisms.                                                                                                   The debate about genome projects has had the feel of historical                 importance since its inception.  Those arguing for and against it,              but particularly the proponents, have self-consciously placed the               Project in a prominent position among the landmarks of biology.                 Whether it belongs in this pantheon remains to be seen, but the                 quality and intensity of debate and the extraordinary power and                 character of the advocates makes the Human Genome Project a                     wonderful case study in how a scientific project is placed on the               national agenda, and what transpires once it is there.                                                                                                          The Genome Project is thus and ideal opportunity to document the                life sciences in transition from pure cottage industry to a mix of              Big and little science.  If the Project proves as important as some             believe it will, then document its early history will be of immense             interest to future historians, sociologists, philosophers, and                  political scientists, not to mention medical doctors and                        scientists.  If the Project fails to meet expectations, then it                 will be a conspicuous failure and its early history will still be               of great interest.                                                                                                                                              Dr. Cook-Deegan, former Executive Director of the Biomedical Ethics             Advisory Committee, along with Doris Goldstein, Director, and Anita             Nolen, Archivist, of the Kennedy Institute Library of Georgetown                University, will assemble a comprehensive bibliography and create               an oral history resource focused on the early history of the Genome             Project.  Because of the evanescence of documentation and memory                of the individuals involved, it is essential to move quickly now.",
