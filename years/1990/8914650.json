 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aconitum noveboracense is a rare plant that is federally                   listed as Threatened.  This study will examine the way in which                 its life history, population dynamics and genetic structure                     interact to influence the viability of the small populations in                 which it exists.                                                                     Three to six years of demographic data have been gathered                  for ten Aconitum populations.  These data will be incorporated                  into a model that simulates population dynamics and determines                  the probability of long-term survival of each population.  The                  population genetic structure of twelve Aconitum populations will                be characterized using ribosomal DNA and random single copy                     genomic probes.  A second model, simulating population viability                based upon genetic criteria, will be used to analyze these data.                Both models will be analyzed to highlight the factors that are                  most important in regulating population viability.                                   In addition to providing basic information on population                   genetic variation, this study will compare the predictions for                  population viability generated by demographic and genetic                       models.  This approach provides an empirical basis from which to                examine the strengths and limitations of existing theoretical                   models. At the same time, it provides a basis for making                        management recommendations for Aconitum populations.  This                      combined study of population dynamics and genetics will enhance                 our understanding of the role each plays in preserving rare                     species.",
