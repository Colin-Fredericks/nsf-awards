This is a targeted topic under the general category of Arctic                   Research under the Memorandum of Understanding between NSF                      and the Soviet Academy of Sciences for basic research                           cooperation.                                                                                                                                                    This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
