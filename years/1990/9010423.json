The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Robertson P. Dinsmore is fully qualified to               direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing similar activities.                                                                                                                                  The R/V KNORR is undergoing a major overhaul/refit/upgrade                      including lengthening by 34 feet, replacement and modernization                 of the propulsion system and refurbishment of interior services                 and surfaces.  This effort is being funded by the Navy through                  the Office of Naval Research.  The NSF contribution will complete               the project by supplying funds for the scientific upgrade of the                R/V KNORR.  This includes modifications to the existing ship                    controls to allow precise dynamic positioning, installation of a                fully integrated winch readout system, a modern workboat which                  will also serve as a rescue boat, two new cranes and a                          hydrographic boom for handling scientific gear, the refurbishment               of the ship's hydrographic winch, installation of modern echo                   sounding systems and an uninterruptible power supply for                        scientific instruments.",
