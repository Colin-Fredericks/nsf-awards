 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two.year collaborative project between                                Jill Bechtold of the University of Arizona and                                  Huang Keliang of Nanjing University to study                                    physical conditions in the early universe.  The                                 project is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese State                               Education Commission.                                                                                                                                           The absorption lines observed in the spectra of                                 very distant quasars provide a powerful probe of                                intervening gas along the line of sight.  The high                              luminosities of quasars enable astronomers to study                             the Universe at great distances and hence at epochs                             when the Universe was about 20 percent of its                                   current age.  This was a period when many important                             events took place .. the formation and rapid early                              evolution of galaxies, the beginnings of the                                    collapse of large structures such as clusters of                                galaxies and superclusters, and the rapid turn.on                               of quasars themselves.  Some quasar absorption                                  lines are caused by clouds in the interstellar                                  medium of normal galaxies; others by intergalactic                              clouds in the interstellar medium of normal                                     galaxies; others by intergalactic clouds that                                   probably represent pre.galactic or proto.galactic                               material of primordial metal abundance.  In either                              case, quasar absorption lines provide direct                                    information about the physical conditions in                                    objects in the early Universe that are too faint to                             study any other way.                                                                                                                                            This goal of this project is to analyze the most                                detailed optical spectra of quasar absorption lines                             obtainable with currently available telescopes and                              instrumentation.  The spectra were obtained with                                the echelle spectro\u001ag.raph at the 4 meter telescope                             at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.",
