This study will be important                                                                                                  to the development of methods for long-term storage of frozen                                                                                                   organs, organs to be used for transplantation of other                          purposes.                                                                                                                                                       The method to be employed involves the correlation of the                       structure of the mammalian tissue after freezing to the                         perfusion treatments prior to freezing and the thermal history                                                                                                  during freezing.  Freezing and thawing will be performed under                                                                                                  a range of controlled thermal conditions with a special                         \"directional solidification: apparatus developed by the                         authors.  The structure and chemical composition of samples                     will be assessed with Low-Temperature, Scanning Electron                        Microscopy, High Voltage Electron Microscopy, and X-Ray                         Microanalysis.  As an outgrowth of a recent expedited award,                    the PI's will perfuse biological organs, specifically heart,                    kidney, and liver, with antifreeze glycopeptides, and study                     the role of this promising substance on the processes of                        tissue freezing.  The experimental results will be used to                      develop mathematical models for the process of the freezing of                                                                                                  tissue.",
