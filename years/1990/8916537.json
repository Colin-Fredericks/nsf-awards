 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range goal of this research is to discover the                         biochemical mechanism of the regulation of lysosomal enzyme                     sorting.  One of the most important steps toward this goal is to                determine the underlying sorting mechanism in the organism.  This               laboratory has recently cloned and sequenced a complete cDNA copy               of the Dictyostelium mRNA which encodes beta-hex, a lysosomal                   enzyme.  The organism has been transformed with a vector designed               to express the beta-hex and other coding sequences, and                         transformants overproduce active enzyme.  Mutational analysis has               begun and a beta-hex-invertase fusion has been prepared for use                 in testing candidate signals.  These clones and vectors will be                 used to determine the sorting signal which directs the protein to               lysosomes.  The most likely signal is either a modified N-linked                oligosaccharide, which is the signal for sorting of lysosomal                   enzymes in mammalian cells, or an amino-terminal polypeptide                    sequence which is the sorting signal for yeast vacuolar proteins.               The immediate aims of this proposal are:  1. To evaluate the role               of N-glycosides in the sorting of beta-hex.  Potential                          glycosylation sites in the coding sequence will be altered, the                 mutated insert will be expressed in Dictyostelium, and the                      sorting of the altered protein will be determined.  2. To                       evaluate the role of amino-terminal domains in the sorting of                   beta-hex.  Two approaches will be taken.  In one, selected                      protions of the amino-terminal coding sequence will be deleted                  and the deleted insert will be subjected to the analysis                        described above.  In another, a signal-reporter fusion system                   will be developed to search for or to confirm potential signals.                The amino-terminal region may also contain information which                    directs intercalation of the protein into membrranes.  Removal of               this information may have indirect effects on sorting.                          Therefore, the planned analysis will include an evaluation of the               effect of deletions and fusions on the membrane intercalation of                the protein.                                                                                                                                                    The study of mechanisms by which lysosomal enzymes are sorted is                a topic of intense scientific interest because of what it can                   teach us about the relationship of protein structure to protein                 transport into specific cellular organelles.  Also, in complex                  organisms, lysosomal enzyme sorting is closely regulated during                 development because these enzymes serve a key role in molding of                embryonic shape.  Dictyostelium discoideum is the simplest                      organism in which such regulation is known to occur. Study of                   this organism thus offers a particularly interesting system in                  which to study the molecular mechanisms of lysosomal enzyme                     sorting in  cells.",
