This survey series collects information on the demographic,                     educational, and employment characteristics of experienced                      scientists and engineers.  The initial survey was conducted in                  1982 and was based on a sample of respondents to the 1980                       Decennial Census who reported occupations in science and                        engineering.                                                                            The National Science Foundation is the principal agency in              the Federal Government for data on the U.S. population of                       scientists and engineers.  The Scientific and Technical Personnel               Data System (STPDS), maintained in the Division of Science                      Resources Studies, is the primary means for collection of this                  information.  In addition to the National Survey of Natural and                 Social Scientists and Engineers, the STPDS comprises the biennial               Survey of Recent Science and Engineering Graduates, the biennial                Survey of Doctorate Recipients, and the Science and Engineering                 Tabulating Model, a computer model used to integrate survey                     results.",
