 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, located on                      Maine's Boothbay Harbor, has been a center for marine research                  since 1974.  The Lab is best known for research on marine                       phytoplankton.  In addition to hosting both resident and visiting               researchers, the Lab is the site of the Provasoli-Guillard Center               for Culture of Marine Phytoplankton, the MacIsaac Flow Cytometry                and Cell Sorting Facility, and a remote sensing laboratory.  Dr.                Robert Andersen, a staff research scientist at Bigelow Lab,                     proposes acquisition of a transmission electron microscope (TEM)                for the Lab.                                                                         Acquisition of the proposed TEM would have a substantial                   impact on both the quality and quantity of research accomplished                at Bigelow Lab.  The closest electron microscope is currently in                Orono, Maine, a two hour drive from the Lab.  This distance                     discourages many visiting scientists from initiating research at                the Lab, and hinders those researchers working there.  The                      Culture Collection at the Lab is an important international                     systematic resource, and the presence of a TEM would facilitate                 an immediate high level of research activity.  Bigelow Lab has an               excellent reputation for supporting visiting scientists with                    facilities and instrumentation.  The proposed acquisition of a                  multi-user TEM would benefit a wide range of marine biologists,                 oceanographers, microbiologists and evolutionary systematists.",
