 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effects of electron transport dominate semiconductor                            device behavior.  The main objective of the proposed                            research is to develop a comprehensive, physically                              accurate transport model, which is suitable for                                 efficient numerical evaluation.  The model will                                 integrate two approaches for characterizing electron                            transport:  the Legendre polynomial technique, and                              the energy transport method.  In addition to                                    determining current densities and electric potentials,                          when fully realized, the model will allow for rapid                             calculation of the electron distribution function                               throughout a device.  Initial studies will focus on                             numerically solving the homogeneous Boltzmann                                   transport equation, using Legendre polynomials, while                           incorporating the effects of phonon scattering, one                             non-parabolic conduction band, and impact ionization.                           The model will then be used to calculate currents                               generated by ionization in MOSFETs.  Next, the                                  effect of several conduction bands will be introduced.                          Finally, the effect of nonlinear electron-electron                              scattering will be accounted for by using Fokker                                Plank formulation.  Spatial dependence will be                                  obtained by evaluating the energy balance equation to                           determine the space-dependent average electron                                  energy.  The space-dependent distribution function                              will then be determined by simultaneous solutions of                            the energy balance equation and the homogeneous                                 Boltzmann equation.  This study will facilitate a                               better understanding of the physical phenomena                                  which affect submicron device operation, and is well                            suited for applications in CAD.",
