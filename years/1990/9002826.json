 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nets are widely used in the theory of concurrency.  One evident reason          for that is the convenience of visualizing the communication structure          of systems.  Nets seem to cover almost any situation which involves             \"sharing\" or communication.  For an engineer it could mean sharing of           component terminals by connecting them electrically; a mathematician            can consider sharing of variables in a system of equations or sharing           relations when they are composed.                                                                                                                               This is a research program into semantics of concurrent systems which           are based on the net concept.  Hopefully the expected results will              provide a reliable basis for design of such systems and reasoning               about them.  As a byproduct one can expect also more insight into the           semantics of nets in other \"sharing situations\".                                                                                                                Fundamental research will be carried out on semantics and proof                 theory of networks of dataflow and other concurrent processes,                  emphasizing \"causal\" semantics to support refinement and atomicity of           process behavior.  The work will be carried out by Professor Boris A.           Trakhtenbrot of Tel Aviv University in collaboration with the                   Principal Investigator.",
