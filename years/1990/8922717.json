 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns equations whose evolution may be                     modelled on the interaction of coherent analytic structures which               range from vortices to multi-phase or multi-similarity wave                     packets to cavitating and collapsing filaments to monopoles.  The               detailed structure of these objects, which can be determined from               asymptotics or geometry or by using the analytical properties of                integrable systems, provides a precise description of the                       mechanisms which give rise to complicated and often chaotic                     dynamics.  In  current and future work, as more modern geometric                and analytical techniques are integrated into the program the                   studies will be extended to systems modelled on non-classical                   geometric structures, statistical ensembles of classical                        structures, spatially extended defect patterns, and topologically               complicated states such as knotted filaments in fluid dynamics or               monopoles in non-abelian gauge theories.  The mathematics                       involved in these studies covers a broad spectrum, from the                     theory of integrable and almost integrable systems and rigorous                 analysis in pde's to the more intuitive ideas best understood in                a geometrical setting.  In many cases, specifically in the                      investigations in convective patterns and optics, real                          experiments are used as a guide to develop and check the validity               of models.  In all cases, each theoretical investigation is                     accompanied by extensive numerical experiments.",
