 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal the PI seeks an image analysis system with                     associated software for automatic analysis of images of                         various liquid-liquid and solid in liquid particulate                           dispersions.  In several outlined related projects the image                    analysis will include the analysis of size and shape of                         particles, fractal structure of the dispersion, particularly                    near the point of complete coalescence or phase inversion, and                  so on.  Such analysis will be crucial input to a theoretical                    framework which seeks to use fractal-theories concepts in                       conjunction with scaling ideas to characterize the behavior of                  dense coalescing dispersions, and address the problem of has                    inversion.  In a second project the image analysis of polymer                   particles is designed to investigate the effectiveness of a                     novel technique of preparing non-spherical polymer particles                    of precisely controlled sizes and shapes for a variety of                       fundamental and practical applications.                                                                                                                         The proposed image analysis system with its capability for                      automatic analysis meets most adequately the requirements of                    fast image processing of large volumes of images obtained                       photographically and by a video recorder in our research.  It                   also facilities direct transmission of data to a mainframe                      computer for the data processing required for the solution of                   critical inverse problems.",
