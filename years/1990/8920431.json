 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will examine how mate choice by females                   affects the evolution of male courtship behavior.  It focuses on                an unusual form of courtship, lek mating, in the sage grouse (a                 gallinaceous bird).  Leks are groups of males that cluster their                territories at sites visited by females for mating.  Female sage                grouse show relatively unanimous preferences for particular males               within a lek.                                                                                                                                                   Two specific ways in which female preferences might cause leks to               form will be investigated in the field.  First, if some males are               inherently more attractive to females than others, leks may form                because less-attractive males settle around more-attractive                     individuals to increase their access to females.  Second, if                    females use prior experience to locate a mate, males may settle                 preferentially at sites where many females have mated in the                    past.  Previous studies have provided evidence that female sage                 grouse base their choices both on characteristics of males and on               prior breeding experience.  In this study, Dr. Gibson will test                 how these patterns of choice affect male territorial settlement.                He will do this by removing from leks males whose own (and whose                neighbors') attractiveness is known, and then monitoring changes                in territory occupancy and mating success among the remaining                   males.                                                                                                                                                          The study will provide specific answers to questions about the                  formation of leks, and will be of more general significance for                 understanding how female choice affects the evolution of male                   courtship behavior.  Because the sage grouse is an upland game                  bird of some economic importance, data from the study will also                 be of value to state wildlife agencies in managing local                        populations.",
