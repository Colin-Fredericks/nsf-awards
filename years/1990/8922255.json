This equipment is maintained for use on or in                       association with the R/V ENDEAVOR, a research vessel owned by                   the NSF and operated by the university.  A substantial part                     of the ship's operating schedule during 1990 is in support of                   NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumentation will                      also increase the capabilities of the ship and of the                           University to support research and engineering activities.                      The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                   -Computer terminal for displaying real-time data as it is                        being collected,                                                               -Fluorometer for measuring chlorophyll and other optical                         properties in the water column,                                                -CTD pressure gauge, to enhancement obtaining detailed                           profiles of seawater conductivity and temperature as a                          function of depth,                                                             -Towed vehicle and digital modem for a side scan echosounder                     system for collecting data on seafloor bathymetry and                           sedimentary profiles,                                                          -Radio ethernet link for enhancing scientific data transfer                      and communications amongst the technical support group and                      scientific users of the ship, and                                              -Dead Weight tester for testing the tolerances and                               calibration of instrumentation before taking them to sea.                                                                                                      The instrumentation described above will increase the                           capability of the organization to support NSF-sponsored                         research and engineering projects.",
