 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study transport phenomena in symplectic                       mappings of four or more dimensions.  The goal is to partition                  phase space into regions bounded by partial barriers through                    which flux occurs.  A candidate for such a region is a resonance,               defined as a volume in the neighborhood of an elliptic point; its               boundary will be obtained from limits of librational periodic                   orbits.  Resonance volumes will be computed and we will                         determine whether resonances partition phase space.  The                        correlation function for orbits in the neighborhood of a                        resonance boundary well be studied to determine whether the                     series for the diffusion tensor converges.  Transport will be                   defined in terms of the flux across resonance boundaries,                       including branching ratios for transitions from one resonance to                a neighboring one, as well as  drift along a commensurability                   channel.  To compute the latter a restricted symplectic map will                be introduced  and studied.   Numerical techniques will include                 frequency filtering and finding periodic orbits.",
