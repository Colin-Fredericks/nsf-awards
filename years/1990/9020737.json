It                      will involve assessment of the \"state-of-the-                                   science/engineering\" associated with biodegradation,                            photodegradation and recycling of plastics.  The project                        will involve interviews with academic researchers, persons                      associated with the plastics industry, and governmental                         agencies concerned with the use and regulation of                               technologies involved in the management of waste plastics.                                                                                                                                                                                      Results of this project are expect to provide a basis for                       determination of future research needs.  The three                              undergraduate students who will be working on this project                      are Emin Abufele, Jodi Pisinski and Christ Sparages.                            Faculty advisors in addition to the Principal Investigator                      include WPI Professors Rollings and Ljungquist.  This                           project is jointly supported by the Environmental Systems                       component of the Environmental and Ocean Systems Program                        and by the Biotechnology Program in the Division of                             Biological and Critical Systems.",
