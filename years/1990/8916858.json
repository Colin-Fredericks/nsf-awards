 "awd_abstract_narration": "This a proposal to continue and expad our isotopic and trace                    element studies of a variety of mantle and mantle-derived rocks                 as tracers of the composition and evolution of the lithosphere                  and upper mantle, and of petrogenetic processes such as melting                 and magma transport.  Our work is centered around isotopic                      studies of Sr, Nd and Pb on the one hand and U, Th series                       isotopes on the other, and the associated trace element                         concentrations which are measured in concert with the isotope                   ratio determinations.  In addition, we discuss plans to add a                   number of important large ionic radius and high field strength                  elements to our capabilities using ICP-MS.  Our investigations                  are varied and have both regional and more uniersal goals.  In                  the most general sense, the work proposed is inteded to further                 our knowledge of the composition and evolution of the lithosphere               anduppermost mantle in both continental and oceanic settings, and               to help nderstand factors such as the timing of magma transport                 and the mechanisms of chemical fractionation during magmagenesis.               Using isotopes as tracers we will also attempt to follow the                    earliest stages of continental crust formation in an accreting                  island arc terrane.  Specific material we will investigate in                   pursuit of these goals incluse lavas from the Sylhet and Deccan                 Traps of India; mantle xenoliths from alkali basalts in Incia,                  China, Western North America and oceanic islands in the South                   Pacifice; a sequence of plutonic rocks from Luzon in the                        Philippines; island arc lavas from the Aleutians, ridge basalts                 from the Pacific and the Mariana Trough back arc basin.",
