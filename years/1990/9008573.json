A workshop program will be formulated to rivet                          attention of research communities on the directions for new                     research in emerging technologies for advanced constructed                      facilities.  The topic areas to be examined include new                         materials, smart structures, super large-scale structures,                      underground facilities, structural evaluation techniques,                       experts systems, etc.                                                                                                                                           Considerable common interests exist in these areas for                          possible joint research efforts in developing new frontiers                     of construction and natural disaster mitigation measures in                     connection with the new constructed facilities. At a time when                  there is a great urgency to revitalize the U.S. technology in                   construction and to restore the industry's competitiveness and                  leadership, the collaboration with Japan and Korea, both                        leaders in the field, is both timely and strategically                          meritorious.                                                                                                                                                    This effort will lead to a comprehensive future research                        agenda in advanced constructed facilities research and                          practical ways to implement these programs by way of                            international cooperation.",
