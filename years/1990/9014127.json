 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the development of faster and more               accurate analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog data converters.               The converters studied are of the interpolating type, which                     effectively trade conversion speed for accuracy.  That is, in                   interpolating type converters, the use of a multibit (rather than               a single-bit) front end in an interpolating converter can lead to               a higher resolution for a given speed or a higher conversion speed              for a fixed resolution.  However, a multibit front-end requires an              analog component accuracy which cannot be achieved without                      complicated and expensive trimming and or randomizing techniques.               A novel digital self-calibration and correction technique which                 achieves the requisite accuracy of the multibit system without any              trimming or randomizing, using only a simple additional digital                 stage is being developed in this research.  The work involves an                architectural study of the novel system, development of the circuit             blocks needed and design, fabrication and testing of several fully              integrated converters based on the novel principle.  This new                   approach should lead to faster and or more accurate converters than             any of the currently available ones.  Such converters will lead to              further developments in important applications such as digital                  radio and television, digital audio, ISDN, radar, etc.",
