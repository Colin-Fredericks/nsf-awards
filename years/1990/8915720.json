 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sediment transport is a ubiquitous oceanographic process.                       Theoretical models and limited laboratory studies indicate that                 sediment transport influences the quantity and quality of organic               matter supplied to benthic deposit feeders, but the magnitudes                  and directions of the influences (i.e., positive or negative) in                the field are essentially unknown.  If sediment transport acts to               enhance food resources, the response by deposit feeders might be                manifested as increased individual growth rates, by accumulation                of energy storage products, or by increased reproductive output.                Conversely, negative responses in these properties should be seen               if sediment transport adversely affects food resources.  Such                   responses might occur singly or in various combinations.  Methods               to measure these parameters in animals collected from the field                 are needed in order to provide realistic tests of hypotheses                    about the effects of sediment transport on the energetics of                    deposit feeders and ultimately, on population dynamics.  To begin               moving in this direction, Drs. Taghon and Prahl will determine                  how nutritional status, growth rate, and reproductive condition                 of several species (including echinoderms, polychaetes, and                     molluscs) vary under different laboratory feeding regimes.  They                will measure changes over time in 3 properties to evaluate their                use in tracking the response of deposit feeders to sediment                     transport:  the accumulation or use of lipid stores (index of                   nutritional status), RNA:DNA ratios (index of growth rate), and                 reproductive condition.",
