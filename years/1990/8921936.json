 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Reynolds and Seely are examining the history of American                   engineering education from the early 19th century through the                   present.  Although engineering educators have studied the                       state of engineering education in particular eras (indeed,                      hardly any profession has studied its educational apparatus                     as frequently), no interpretive history of engineering                          education exists.  Using archival collections, interviews with                  engineering educators, and an enormous secondary literature                     contained both in engineering periodicals and published                         monographs,  Drs. Reynolds and Seely are preparing a synthetic                  history of engineering education.  They see several common                      themes running through the history of engineering education.                    Their examination of these continuities and the different                       responses of engineering educators to them provide the basic                    framework for the study.  Examples of these continuities are                    the struggle to train engineers within a four-year curriculum                   and the associated tensions between practical and general                       education.  Other continuities include debates over the place                   of research and graduate programs, the role of industry,                        government, and professional societies in engineering                           education, and the ways educational institutions should                         respond to changing engineering \"manpower\" concerns.  Although                  technology and society have changed significantly over the                      past century and a half, the similarities between the problems                  faced by contemporary engineering educators and those of the                    past are such that an historical perspective is important.",
