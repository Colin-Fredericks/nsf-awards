 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on judicial careers and behavior is a relatively young                 specialty in social science that so far has focused mainly on                   trial and appellate court judges.  The nation's lowest courts,                  district courts, have been the least studied despite their                      numbers and significance to ordinary citizens.  The office of                   lower-court judge is a powerful position that is central to the                 functioning of the legal system.  Traditionally, it has been a                  male semi-profession but recently a growing number of women have                been entering this field.  An understanding of judicial attitudes               and decisionmaking in this non-traditional occupation has both                  theoretical and practical potential.                                                                                                                            This project involves an analysis of the occupation of the lower-               court judge in terms of work demands and the enactment of and                   adaptation to the job.  A random sample of female and male judges               in both rural and urban counties in Pennsylvania will be studied.               Central to the analysis will be (1) a description of the social                 backgrounds of job occupants and gender differences; (2) gender                 differences/similarities in work history and career paths leading               to and away from the judge role; and (3) gender                                 differences/similarities in judicial attitudes and orientations.                Using a combination of face-to-face interviews, courtroom                       observations, and analysis of archival data describing caseloads                and community characteristics, a theory of the minor judiciary                  will be built and refined.  The opportunity to assess gender-                   based differences in work orientations and behavior in an                       identical job for men and women office-holders provides a unique                perspective.                                                                                                                                                    This study will yield an extensive and rich data base on the                    minor judiciary.  In addition, it will contribute to the sparse                 literature on judicial careers, gender and work, and men and                    women in elective offices.  Applying theory and research on                     gender and work to the work experiences of lower-court judges                   will offer not only a fresh approach to theory building in the                  area but also a broader view of judicial careers and behavior                   that should add significantly to our understanding of the                       judiciary.",
