 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants display a remarkable diversity of mating systems.                   Plant species that have mixed mating systems (e.g., both self-                  fertilize and outcross) provide a special opportunity for                       studying how natural selection molds the mating system.  Some                   controversy surrounds this issue because different theoretical                  models make different predictions concerning which factors are                  important.  The proposed research will use the common annual,                   Impatiens capensis, to examine whether inbreeding depression                    increases or decreases with a history of inbreeding in a                        population.  Using electrophoresis, the investigator will analyze               the sources of inbreeding and genetic structure in several                      natural populations.  This information will be compared to levels               of inbreeding depression and genetic load in each population                    derived from competition experiments.  This should reveal whether               the genetic load increases due to drift and mutation, or is                     purged via selection when inbreeding occurs.                                         The results of this research should help determine which                   possible genetic effects steer mating system evolution.  In                     addition, it should identify the sources and consequences of                    inbreeding in natural populations.  This information will help                  illuminate the genetic hazards faced by the small populations of                rare and threatened species and may help guide artificial                       selection and plant breeding in agricultural programs.",
