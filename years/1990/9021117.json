 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the second                largest professional society of computer and information                        scientists and engineers in the United States.  ACM has an                      international membership of approximately 80,000.                                    The project is expressly designed to address a well                        documented lack of information concerning the nature of                         disability in science and engineering professions.  ACM will                    utilized the information resulting from the assessment in                       attracting individuals with disabilities to the computer and                    information science profession in general and ACM membership and                participation in particular.  They will use the information to                  plan the development and modification of member policies to                     increase the quality of service for disabled members.  Potential                specific results include:                                                            * Improved planning for conferences, symposia, and workshops               to ensure equal opportunities for professionals with                            disabilities, both ACM members and nonmembers, to participate.                       * Determine alternatives for regular member services                       including publications to make them more accessible to members                  with disabilities.                                                                   *Identify means to attract more individuals with                           disabilities to the computing professions in general and ACM                    membership in particular.                                                            The project is directly related to the interests and                       objectives of the NSF Computer Information Science and                          Engineering Directorate in that CISE represents the computing                   profession within NSF and is particularly interested in                         furthering opportunities for professionals with disabilities in                 computer and information science.",
