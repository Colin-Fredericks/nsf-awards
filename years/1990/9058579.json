 "awd_abstract_narration": "One goal is to incorporate the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) into                 the molecular dynamics simulation package being developed by                    Charles Peskin and Tamar Schlick at the Courant Institute.  In                  such particle simulations, the greatest computational burden has                classically been that of evaluating the self-consistent                         electrostatic field induced by all of the partially charged                     individual atoms.  This is precisely the problem addressed by the               FMM.  The hope is that certain inaccuracies in molecular dynamics               calculations can be eliminated, yielding more physically                        reasonable results.                                                                                                                                             The second major area of research is potential theory for the                   heat equation.  Earlier work, in collaboration with John Strain,                has yielded a scheme for the rapid evaluation of heat potentials.               It is planned to devote substantial research time over the next                 few years to the examination of extensions of this scheme as well               as its ramifications.  The combination of potential theory and                  integral equations may provide a fundamental change in the way                  heat equations are solved, since spatially complex and time-                    dependent domains are handled without additional difficulty.  It                also appears likely that the method will extend in a natural way                to variable coefficient and nonlinear parabolic partial                         differential equations.                                                                                                                                         The third area of research is phase separation in material                      science.  A new integral equation-based scheme has been                         constructed for the Laplace equation in multiply connected                      domains.  It is planned to incorporate this method into a model                 of \"Ostwald ripening,\" which follows the dynamic motion of the                  interface between two phases.  This requires the solution of                    Laplace's equation at each step.",
