 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Martin Kirk has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                        Fellowship in Chemistry.  Dr. Kirk's doctoral degree was from                   The University of North Carolina under the supervision of                       Professor William Hatfield. Dr. Kirk intends to continue                        research at Stanford University under the sponsorship of                        Professor Edward Solomon.  Dr. Kirk's area of research will be                  physical-inorganic studies which relate the activity of                         transition metal ions in protein active-sites to their geometry                 and structure.  Long range, he will study biomimetic manganese                  complexes related to the oxygen-evolving centers in                             Photosystem-II. His postdoctoral studies on the behavior of                     iron-sulfur clusters related to ferridoxins will facilitate his                 future research.                                                                                                                                                The Postdoctoral Fellowships in Chemistry Program is viewed as                  an important infrastructural program designed to broaden the                    knowledge and experience of new Ph.D's and attract them into                    meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research and                        teaching.",
