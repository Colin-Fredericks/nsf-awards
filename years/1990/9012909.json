 "awd_abstract_narration": "A singular implicit differential equation is an implicit ordinary               differential equation of the form F(y',y,u,t) = 0 where y is a vector           valued function, the Jacobian Fy' is a singular matrix, u is a vector           valued function, and t is time.  Such implicit systems frequently               arise in a variety of control problems in flight control, robotics,             and contact or constrained problems in mechanics.  In addition,                 implicit differential equations occur in the solution of partial                differential equations by the method of lines and in many circuit               models.  Singular systems are frequently called differential algebraic          equations (DAEs) or discriptor systems.                                                                                                                         It is proposed to develop methods for analyzing nonlinear implicit              differential equations and computing their solutions.  These results            will also be of interest when the state equations exist, but the                sparsity, nonlinearity, or dependence on parameters of the equations,           make the original implicit system preferable to a lower order, but              non-sparse, (or difficult to compute local) explicit state system.              The numerical computation of control theoretic information directly             from the original equations will be investigated as part of the                 proposed research.",
