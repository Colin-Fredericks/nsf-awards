 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the behavior of interest rates,                  inflation, asset returns, and the relations between these                       variables and business conditions.  Research on the term                        structure of interest rates will examine the information                        contained in U.S. government bond yields about future interest                  rates, inflation, and real bond returns.  Research on corporate                 bonds and stocks will examine common factors in the variation                   through time in their returns.  An important part of this work                  will be to relate the short-term and long-term behavior of                      interest rates, inflation, and asset returns to measures of                     business conditions.  The goal of project is a better                           understanding of the links between financial markets and the real               economy, eg. output, investment, employment, etc.  Understanding                these links takes on even greater importance with the increasing                globalization of financial markets, investment decisions, and                   output decisions.",
