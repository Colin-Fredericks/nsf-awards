 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for a liquid scintillation (LS)                  system to provide new and important technical capabilities in                   the principal investigator's (PI's) research programs.                          Specializing in mass transfer through membranes and porous                      media, the principal investigator is currently focusing her                     research efforts in two areas:  (1) percutaneous absorption of                  solutes, and (2) in-place remediation technologies for vadose                   zone soils.  The ability to measure concentrations of                           radiolabelled compounds will greatly expand the scientific                      issues which can be studied in these two programs.  Although                    LS counting is essential to the research endeavors described                    here, the extent of use on a given research project makes                       justification of its purchase as dedicated instrument on                        single research proposal difficult.  Consequently, the                          proposed instrument will be made available for campus wide                      use.  Presently LS counting is not available at the Colorado                    School of Mines (CSM).  The proposed LS system will provide                     many important new research opportunities for other                             researchers at CSM.  As with many other analytical                              instruments, the demands LS capabilities certainly will grow                    once an instrument is available on the CSM campus.",
