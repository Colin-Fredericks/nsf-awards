 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will develop, test, and document a model                  for school-wide change in the teaching of elementary and middle                 school mathematics, with the goal of promoting instruction that                 is consistent with the California Mathematics Framework and the                 NCTM Standards.  Led by project staff and sixteen teachers                      serving as \"math leadership candidates,\" five elementary                        schools and four middle schools in California will conclude a                   five-year staff development program that was begun with state                   and local funding.  Each summer, the mathematics leadership                     candidates will attend one-week institutes to prepare them for                  their leadership roles.  All teachers in the participating                      schools will, at district expense, take a one-week course on                    mathematics content and methodology offered by Marilyn Burns                    Associates.  During the academic years, the mathematics                         leadership candidates will meet regularly with project staff                    and will provide monthly inservice sessions to the entire staff                 of the participating schools.  Products of the project will                     include a Mathematics Leadership Guide.                                                                                                                         The California State Department of Education, the Alameda                       County Office of Education, and the participating school                        districts are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal to                   88% of the NSF award.",
