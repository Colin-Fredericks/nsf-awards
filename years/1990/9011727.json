 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunity for Women Career Advancement Award is                 in the general area of organic chemistry.  Dr. Leah L. Frye of                  the Chemistry Department of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute                    will synthesize a series of biomimetic potential ion channels.                  Once a macromolecule which will facilitate ion transport across                 phospholipid layers is prepared, systematic modifications of                    its structure will be performed to ascertain what the optimal                   locations of heteroatom-containing functional groups                            (potentially metal binding sites) are for ion transport and how                 the rate of transport is affected by different functional                       groups.  A crown ether will be used to construct the central                    core of the macromolecule and cholesterol, attached by ester                    bonds, will be used for six side chains.                                                                                                                        This award will enable Dr. Frye, building on her experience in                  organic synthesis, to develop expertise in evaluation of ion                    transport across lipid bilayers.  If this initial project is                    successful, many additional projects will become viable and                     Frye will have established a new direction for her research                     career.",
