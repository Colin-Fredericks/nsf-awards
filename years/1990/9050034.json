 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computer Equity Expert Project, which builds on a                      completed NSF-funded pilot project, is designed to train 200                    computer, science, and mathematics education specialists                        throughout the U.S. to become trainers of teachers.  The focus                  of the training is on techniques to overcome gender biases in                   the teaching and use of computers in science and mathematics                    at the middle school/junior high school level and to attract                    more girls into fields which utilize computers.                                      Teacher Trainer participants will attend a five-and-a-                     half-day seminar on either the East Coast or the West Coast                     followed by field experience training teachers in their home                    states.  The trainers will also attend a two-day follow up                      session which will be held between four and six months after                    the initial seminar.  Networking activities will be planned                     at the seminars and will be a major ingredient of the follow                    up sessions.  The network which is formed will be utilized to                   continue the training of teachers after NSF funding expires.                    Cost sharing for this project in the amount of $90,000 is 9.8%                  of the NSF contribution.",
