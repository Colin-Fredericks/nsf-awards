 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within the past decade it has become apparent that there are                    numerous non-lymphocytic cytokines that have profound effects                   (either directly or indirectly) on virtually every aspect of                    vertebrate defense responses.  These mediators, which include                   interleukin 1 alpha and beta, tumor necrosis factor, transforming               growth factor beta, chemotactic factors, colony stimulating                     factors, interferons alpha and beta, interferon beta 2 (IL-6),                  and others may also play a role in normal physiological processes               related to growth, development aging, and homeostasis in general.               The objectove of this symposium is to bring together the                        outstanding international junior and senior scientists working in               the general area of the biology and biochemisry of non-                         lymphocytic cytokines to discuss the following topics:  1. the                  molecular biology, biochemical characterization and biological                  properties of the various non-lymphocytic cytokines, 2. their                   synthesis, processing and release, 3. the physiologic and                       pharmacologic actions of these cytokines at the molecular,                      cellular, tissue, organ system, and organism levels, 4. the                     biochemistry of cytokine receptors and post-receptor events, 5.                 the interactions of non-lymphocytic cytokines including various                 feedback loops (both positive and negative) and potential                       synergistic actions, 6. the practical applications of cytokines                 and agents that affect their synthesis, release, or actions.                                                                                                    This symposium will promote the interaction and exchange of                     information among investigators actively pursuing this important                and rapidly developing subject.",
