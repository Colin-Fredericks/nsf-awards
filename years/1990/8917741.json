 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aims of this research are to the structure and                     function of endonuclease III of Escherichia coli and to                         identify endonuclease III - like enzymes in other organism.                     Three major approaches to study the structure and function of                   endonuclease III will be used.  Firstly, site directed                          mutagenesis will be employed to alert a small number of                         specific amino acid residues suggested from previous studies                    to play a major role in enzyme activity and the mutant                          enzymes will be examined using biochemical techniques.                          Secondly, the binding of endonuclease III to damaged DNA will                   be studies using synthetic oligonucleotides containing a                        unique damaged base of AP site.  Footprinting experiments                       and chemical protection experiments will give information                       about specific binding of enzyme to DNA, about specific                         contacts with bases and phosphate backbone and will allow an                    estimate of the binding constant of the enzyme to damaged                       DNA.  Thirdly, endonuclease III will be crystallized and the                    three-dimensional structure of the protein will be determined                   by X-ray crystallography.  If possible, the enzyme will be                      co-crystallized with one or more of the synthetic                               oligonucleotides mentioned above for X-ray analysis.                            Antibodies will be used as a means of identifying                               endonuclease III-like enzymes in E. coli and other organisms.                   The cloning, nucleotide sequencing of the genes for these                       enzymes and purification of these enzymes will yield useful                     information about the conservation of the Fe-S center and                       residues or domains that seem to be critical for enzymatic                      function.",
