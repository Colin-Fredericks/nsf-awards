The objective of the conference is                       to bring together researchers and practitioners in the                          multidisciplinary fields of design and productivity aspects                     of advanced manufacturing systems involving CAD, CAE, CIM,                      Parametric Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Robotics,                      and Factory of the Future.  The Indian organizer is Dr. R.                      Sagar, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of                     Technology, New Delhi.  The sponsors, in addition to the                        IIT, Delhi include the International Society for                                Productivity Enhancement (USA), the IIT, Madras, the                            IEEE-Delhi Section and the Department of Electronics of the                     Government of India.  Approximately 150 U.S. scientists                         have submitted papers for presentation in the conference.                                                                                                       Scope:  This conference is a first attempt at bringing                          together interdisciplinary branches of engineering and                          science to address issues of productivity, thus                                 implementing the concept of concurrent engineering and                          synchronous manufacturing.  The objective of scientists                         from developed and developing countries is to generate                          ideas to foster the growth of industry and related research                     activities in participating countries.  The conference is                       planned to be one of the largest of its kind in the world                       both in scope and number of participants.  It is likely to                      lead to increased Indo-U.S. cooperation.",
