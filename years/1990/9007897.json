 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to test whether leaf-                 decomposing fungi short-circuit phosphorus mineralization in a                  phosphorus-depauperate tropical rainforest.  A microcosm                        experiment is planned to determine if fungi can export 32P from                 partially decomposed leaves into fresh litter.  Fungal transport                from old litter could explain previously observed increased in P                above 100% of the initial amount during early stages of leaf                    decomposition.  If mineralization of phosphorus from litter is                  bypassed because of internal recycling by decomposer fungi the                  availability of P to plant roots may be restricted.  In some                    phosphorus and nitrogen depauperate ecosystems, nutrients                       sequestered in fungal biomass may become available to higher                    plants when fungal populations crash.  Future objectives will                   include the determination of timing of nutrient mineralization                  from fungal biomass as it may be controlled by wetting and drying               cycles and fungivorous microarthropods.                                                                                                                         Results of this research should have implications for the                       management of tropical forest ecosystems as well as for the                     fundamental ecological understanding of those systems.  The                     principal investigator is well motivated and supported by                       knowledgeable colleagues.  Institutional facilities and                         accommodation are adequate to the research.",
