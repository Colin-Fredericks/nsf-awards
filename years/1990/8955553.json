In SANDALS-TEAMS, students in Baltimore City public and private schools         sample college life and engage in laboratory activities and research.           Biotechnology is the theme of courses in microbiology, biochemistry,            chemistry, mathematics, computer science, field/career experiences, and         workshops in academic skills.  Students work for three weeks in public          or private research facilities, and apply scientific methodology to             research a topic in biotechnology related to coursework.  Participants          earn $50/academic week, and $75/research week.  A follow-up program             provides academic and motivational reinforcement activities.  SANDALS-          TEAMS is a cooperative venture of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland         and the Baltimore City Schools.  There is a $25 application fee.",
