 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Mathematical Behavioral Sciences.  The faculty                group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators               who come from a diverse set of disciplinary backgrounds, but who                share a common interest in the use of mathematical models in the                study of cognition and related phenomena.  The research programs                in which trainees will participate are aimed at investigation of                axiomatic and foundational issues, and at modeling behavioral                   phenomena from psychophysics, decision making, cognition processes              and social networks.  The funds will provide stipends for graduate              students and postdoctoral fellows, will defray part of the cost of              the trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend                   scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring             visiting faculty from other research and academic institutions to               provide specialized seminars and coursework.                                                                                                                    Traditionally, the study of behavior has been undertaken by                     investigators in a number of distinct disciplines, often defined                by the subjects with which the behavior deals.  Thus there are                  important behavioral aspects to the study of economics, political               science, sociology, anthropology, risk management and decision                  science, among others.  Because of the considerable specialized                 knowledge required by each discipline and the differing arenas in               which the behavior may occur, it has been difficult for                         investigators to identify underlying commonalities in behavior                  patterns.  Increasingly, the use of mathematical models is                      providing an important approach for identifying such commonalities              and for providing a means for applying principles recognized in one             discipline to the problems of another.  The training program funded             by this award will produce researchers able to bridge disciplines               and to bring the full power of mathematics to bear on a large                   variety of problems in the social and cognitive sciences.",
