 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal in restructuring Bowdoin's Modern Physics laboratory is to             increase active and thoughtful participation of students in the                 laboratory experience through involvement in the design,                        construction, and execution of lab experiments.  The new lab                    experiments are designed to achieve this goal for a broad range of              students with differing career goals, at the level appropriate to               each student. This constraint has led to the choice of a lab                    structure with three levels of experiments, varying their degree of             sophistication and instrumentation.  For more efficient use of                  resources these experiments have been created using some common                 equipment where possible.  The major instruments used are PC-based              plug-in multichannel analyzers, scintillators and scintillation                 counters, X-ray diffractometers, photomultipliers, time-to-amplitude            converters, as well as germanium, silicon, and sodium-iodide                    detectors.  These are being used in various experiments involving               nuclear decay machanisms, gamma-rays, X-rays, and other decay                   products such as positrons or muons.  This project is a necessary               step in achieving the goal of providing excellent preparation for               those considering further graduate study, as well as cultivating and            encouraging students to major in physics who may follow other career            paths.  The college is matching the award with an equal amount of               funds.",
