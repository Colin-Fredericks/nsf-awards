 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments to determine the compositions of pyroxenes in the                   assemblage enstatite + diopside + forsterite + anorthite will be                performed in the systems CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO at temperatures from                 925oC to 1175oC, and pressures of 5000 and 7500 bars.  Results                  from these experiments will be combined with results obtained                   earlier in this experimental program at atmospheric pressure, and               at 2500 and 5000 bars.  The experimental data will be used to                   construct and to constrain empirical and thermodynamic models of                subsolidus pyroxene phase equilibria, which may then be applied                 to methods of estimating temperatures and pressures of                          equilibration of felspathic, mafic and ultramafic rocks.                        Pyroxene compositions will be reversed, both in terms of Ca/Mg                  ratio and Al contents by approaching the equilibrium compositions               from starting compositions with both higher and lower values.                   Experiments will use vanadium pentoxide as a high-temperature                   solvent to promote grain growth and chemical equilibration;                     several lines of evidence developed earlier in this experimental                program demonstrate that this technique produces negligible                     effects upon the equilibria under investigation.  Analysis of                   compositions and phase assemblages will be performed                            petrographically, by electron microprobe, and powder X-ray                      diffraction, supplemented by scanning and transmission electron                 microscopy and single crystal X-ray diffraction as required.",
