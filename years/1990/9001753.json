 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on two kinds of nonclassical states is proposed. The                  first are states whose phase is correlated with their ampli-                    tude.  States of this kind can be detected by measuring their                   noise after they have passed through a Kerr medium. The                         objective is to develop a formalism for describing the                          phase/amplitude correlations for such states. The second set of                 states to be studied are the so called squeezed states. In                      particular, those states which are squeezed in the mode ampli-                  tudes (quadratic squeezing). Three basic forms of quadratic                     squeezing have already been examined and it is proposed to                      study the nature of mixed forms of these states. Here,                          non-linear interactions can transform different types of                        quadratically squeezed states among themselves. These trans-                    formations will be studied in some detail in the proposal.",
