 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oxygen limitation is a major obstacle in antibiotic                             fermentations that utilize the aerobic bacteria                                 Streptomyces.  Current methods to increase oxygen transfer                      to Streptomyces include improved bioreactor design and                          modified culture media.  A novel approach to the problem of                     oxygen transfer is the development of strains that can                          obtain oxygen from the medium more efficiently.  The current                    proposal is directed towards the development of a                               genetically modified strain that expresses a bacterial                          hemoglobin-like protein.  This protein was originally                           discovered in the aerobic bacteria Vitreoscilla, and                            apparently enables the cells to survive in a oxygen-poor                        environment.  When Vitreoscilla hemoglobin was expressed in                     the bacteria Escherichia coli, the recombinant cells                            demonstrated higher growth and respiration rates, and grew                      to higher cell densities.  The gene encoding this protein                       will be introduced into Streptomyces coelicolor, which                          produces the antibiotic actinorhodin.  The recombinant cells                    will then be tested for their growth and respiratory                            properties, and actinorhodin production.  The demonstration                     of enhanced growth, respiration, and/or actinorhodin yields                     in this system will have broad implications not only for                        antibiotic fermentations but for any bioprocess system that                     involves aerobic cell culture.",
