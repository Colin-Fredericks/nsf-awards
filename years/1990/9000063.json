 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of deforestation on the extinction rates of plant                   species in tropical rain forests are well documented.  Less is                  known about the impact of deforestation on the loss of genetic                  variation within tree species because there is not enough                       information about the amount and patterns of spatial distribution               of genetic variation in natural populations.  Genetic variation                 is considered to be important in the long term survival of                      populations.  Thus, information about the amount and patterns of                genetic variation within and among populations is central to the                design of appropriate measures to conserve tropical tree                        populations.  Equally important is to understand the genetic                    factors, such as mating systems and the level of gene exchange                  among populations, which greatly influence the distribution of                  genetic variation.                                                                                                                                              Many tree species in tropical rain forests have low population                  density.  Small populations may lose genetic variation, and may                 also be subject to inbreeding depression (deleterious effects in                reproductive output due to mating among close relatives).  Thus,                it is paricularly important to study factors regulating genetic                 variation in species that typically occur in low densities.  The                objectives of this research are to 1.  analyze the amount and                   patterns of genetic variation, 2.  estimate effective population                size, 3.  measure the rate of outcrossing (or inbreeding), 4.                   determine the level of gene exchange among populations, and 5.                  examine the effects of density on the level of inbreeding and                   reproductive output in natural populations of tropical lowland                  rain forest trees.  The field work will be conducted at the La                  Selva Biological Field Station of the Organization for Tropical                 Studies in Costa Rica, and the laboratory work at the University                of Massachusetts at Boston.",
