 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maternal aggression, which has been observed in a variety of               mammals in both naturalistic and laboratory settings, functions                 to protect the home and young as well as to disperse adults and                 juveniles.  While much is known about the physiological                         determinants of other aspects of parental behavior and other                    forms of aggressive behavior, comparatively little is known                     concerning the biological basis of maternal aggression.  Yet,                   females mammals exhibit dramatic changes in their aggressive                    behavior toward conspecifics during pregnancy, postpartum estrus,               and lactation.  Dr. Svare has shown that females are aggressive                 during pregnancy, become docile during postpartum estrus, and                   then become intensively aggressive during lactation.  He will                   determine the role of steroid hormones in the stimulation and                   inhibition of these behavioral changes.  Dr. Svare will                         systematically examine aggressive behavior and steroid hormone                  (estradiol, progesterone, testosterone) concentrations throughout               pregnancy and early postpartum period.  He will then use this                   information to construct a schedule of exogenous hormones to                    reproduce the specific behaviors.  The results will enhance our                 knowledge of the biological basis of female aggressive behavior                 and may ultimately prove important for understanding the                        behavioral changes that frequently occur in human peripartum                    females.",
