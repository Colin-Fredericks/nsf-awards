 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor P.B.Armentrout is supported by the Experimental                       Physical Chemistry Program.  He is studying a number of                         molecular systems used in the production of catalytic materials                 and very short lived chemical species known as reaction                         intermediates. This research is done by a technique called                      flowing afterglow mass spectroscopy.                                            In this work,the flowing afterglow source is designed to                        provide ionized species which are thermalized and hence have                    well characterized internal energies. The samples used in this                  work are coordinatively unsaturated transition metal centers                    and are extremely short lived; as a result, they are detected                   by a guided ion beam mass spectrometer. These transient species                 are important reaction intermediates in many commercial                         catalytic processes.",
