 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Martin Uman of the University of              Florida in collaboration with Professor Carlo Mazzetti of the                   University of Rome and Professor Carlo Nucci of the University of               Bologna, Italy.  The investigators intend to develop the best                   possible lightning return-stroke model with which to calculate                  lightning-induced voltages on power lines; and to test and                      improve, given the electric and magnetic fields from the return-                stroke model, the available power line coupling models in order to              arrive at an optimum one.                                                                                                                                       Due to the large diffusion of sensitive solid state electronic                  devices in control and regulation systems of power and telecom-                 munications lines, the problem of induced voltages by nearby                    lightning strokes is of increasing concern.  In this work,                      experimental data on lightning-induced power line voltages and                  associated electric and magnetic fields from nearby natural                     lightning and from artificially initiated lightning (via rocket                 triggering), will form the bulk of the data base.  The collabora-               tion, which will involve theoretical studies done in cooperation                with Swiss researchers, will complement both experimental and                   theoretical research performed at the University of Florida.",
