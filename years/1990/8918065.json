 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ruminants are a diverse and important group of mammals,                comprising 35 genera in nine families, including bovids (goats,                 sheep, cows), cervids (deer, elk) and giraffids.  These and                     several extinct groups of ruminants are represented in the fossil               record, but the detailed morphology of their cranial bones has                  not been studied in detail.  To date, most comparative research                 on the classification and evolution of fossil and living                        ruminants has been based on post-cranial skeletal remains                       (especially features of the limbs) and teeth.  Dr. S. David Webb                proposes an ambitious study of cranial morphology of                            representatives of living and fossil ruminant groups, for the                   purpose of reconstructing their evolutionary relationships.  The                results of his analysis will be compared and integrated with                    results based on non-cranial data, and several varieties of                     molecular data, including mitochondrial DNA sequences.                               The proposed research has wide implications.  A synthesis of               new and existing data will help to crystallize the most precise                 picture of ruminant evolution to date.  A robust family tree for                adaptation, biogeography, functional morphology, and                            biodiversity.  The results of this research will find a wide                    audience among comparative anatomists, mammalogists, and                        evolutionary biologists.",
