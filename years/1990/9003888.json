The objectives of the research are to use these records                         to:  (1) conduct a comprehensive building performance                           study for the time-varying nature of vibration periods                          and damping, and (2) estimate the maximum story drift, a                        crucial quantity for the assessment of possible building                        damage.                                                                                                                                                         A well established system identification method, improved                       in accuracy and efficiency in a related research program                        supported by the National Science Foundation, will be                           used for the parameter identification in this research.                         The identification of the vibration period and damping                          will be carried out for about 40 building records.  The                         story drift estimation requires the development of a new                        method and will be carried out for selected buildings.                          The time-varying nature of the building period, damping,                        and story drift will be used to assess and calibrate the                        building damage state.  The information obtained will                           form the basis for a building performance evaluation                            procedure.                                                                                                                                                      Based on the findings of this research, a procedure of                          post-earthquake building performance evaluation using                           strong motion records will be recommended for future                            applications.",
