The program will                   consist of a coordinated, four-course sequance, three                           mathematics content courses and one course on mathematics                       learning and teaching.  The mathematics courses will be based                   on the NCTM Standards (1989) and the instruction in these                       courses will provide the prospective elementary teachers with                   the constructivist model of teaching.  The coordinated course                   sequence will make the connection between the development of                    subject matter knowledge and the development of pedagogical                     knowledge in mathematics.  In addition, CEM will study the                      nature of prospective teachers' learning, development, and                      attitudes as they participate in the new program.  A new                        instrument to assess the subject matter knowledge of                            elementary teachers in mathematics will be developed for the                    project.  The research component of the project will evaluate                   and document the new model and contribute to the knowledge                      base for future teacher preparation efforts.  Faculty from                      the mathematics department and                                                  from the mathematics education department will work jointly in                  developing the program.  Consultants who are leaders in                         mathematics, mathematics education, and teacher education will                  advise the project.  Classroom teachers will participate in                     planning courses and in providing classroom expertise to the                    preservice teachers during the methods course.  The instructional               model developed by the project and the research findings will be                disseminated to the statewide network of Commonwealth campuses                  and teacher centers in Pennsylvania.  The University's cost                     sharing will be 17% of NSF's contribution.",
