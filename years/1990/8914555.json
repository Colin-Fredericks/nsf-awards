 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. John                 Fischer, University of Pennsylvania and Dr. Patrick Bernier, Groupe             de Dynamique des Phases Condensees, University of Science and                   Technology of Languedoc, Montpellier, France.  The objective of the             project is to carry out NMR, X-ray and neutron scattering studies               of the local structure and staging transitions in doped polymers.                                                                                               The investigators propose a coordinated program to elucidate the                evolution of novel short and long range atomic correlations, as                 alkali metals are introduced into polyacetylene.  In particular,                Drs. Fischer and Bernier will examine:  1) the possibility of                   metallic rather than purely ionic character of the inserted alkali;             2) novel and complex phase equilibria vs. doping concentration,                 analagous to \"staging\" in layer intercalates and 3) a first                     measurement of the Q-integrated partial phonon density of states                using incoherent inelastic neutron scattering.  The contributions               of the two investigators are complementary in three important                   categories:  materials synthesis, measurement capabilities and                  theoretical expertise.  Dr. Bernier and his group have extensive                experience with electrochemical doping by alkali metals, the                    preferred method for studying in situ the evolution of properties               with doping.  Dr. Fischer's strength is in the vapor and liquid-                phase alkali metal doping of carbon-based synthetic metals.  The                results of this research may provide valuable new information on                the structure and electronic properties of doped polymers, with                 important implications for future materials research.",
