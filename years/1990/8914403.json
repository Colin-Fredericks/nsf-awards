 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Clouthier is supported by a grant from The Experimental                     Physical Chemistry Program to study the high resolution spectra                 of small transient molecules and free radicals produced through                 high temperature decomposition in an expanding jet.  The                        results of this work have a direct impact on many areas of                      applied research and engineering including energy conversion,                   fuel utilization, coal gasification, and chemical vapor                         deposition techniques used in the semiconductor industry.                                                                                                       Dr. Clouthier has developed a new technique which he calls                      pyrolysis jet spectroscopy, in which precursor molecules,                       entrained in a high pressure stream of inert gas, are pyrolyzed                 just prior to expansion through a nozzle into a vacuum chamber.                 The short contact time and expansion cooling allow the                          observation of the rotationally cold spectra of even very                       short-lived and reactive species.  He plans to apply this new                   technique to the study of several transient species including:                  dichlorocarbene, formyl cyanide, thioacetaldehyde, thioacetone,                 selenoformaldehyde, and a series of alkyl metal compounds                       thought to be important intermediates in the chemical vapor                     deposition process used by semiconductor industries.",
