The symposium will be held in conjunction with the 200th                        National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in                            Washington, D.C. on August 26, 1990.  The symposium, sponsored                  jointly by the Committee on Professional Training of the                        American Chemical Society, the National Science Foundation, and                 the American Chemical Society Education Division, will examine                  the feasibility and vitality of non-traditional approaches to                   teaching introductory chemistry.  The outcome of the event is                   anticipated to be a heightened awareness of the advantages of                   new approaches and stimulation for curriculum development.                      Publication of the proceedings of the meeting will reach those                  colleges and universities that graduate more than 90% of the                    nation's chemistry bachelors degrees.",
