 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fruiting plants that rely on frugivorous birds for seed                    dispersal may experience important fitness consequences resulting               from neighborhood influences on bird foraging movements.  Birds                 respond to spatial patterns of fruit resource availability; thus                these patterns will influence seed deposition patterns.                         Neighborhood effects on seed dispersal have not been studied.                   This research examines these effects on a tropical mistletoe                    species in pasture trees at Monteverde, Costa Rica.  Neighborhood               effects from the individual plant perspective, on three stages                  of dispersal; bird visitation, behavior during visits, and post-                visitation movements, using an array of high and low density host               and mistletoe neighborhoods (ca. 1 ha) will be determined.                      Mistletoes provide good systems for examining seed dispersal                    because bird deposition of seeds can be observed directly, and,                 as parasites, they have unique dispersal requirements.                               The study system provides a unique opportunity to examine                  these effects because of the arrangement of hosts and mistletoes                at the site.  The study will also enhance general knowledge of                  these little-studied tropical species.  Disturbed habitats, such                as the proposed site, are of increasing importance in the                       neotropics with the continuing loss of forests, and an                          understanding of ecological interactions in these habitats is                   likewise of increasing importance.  Mistletoes can be serious                   pests in deforested areas where mostly susceptible trees are left               standing; thus, this study is of both basic and applied                         interest.",
