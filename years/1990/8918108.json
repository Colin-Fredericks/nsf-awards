 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are found widely in plants, animals          and protozoa.  The structure and basic mechanism of function of                 eukaryotic cilia and flagella is common among these wide variety of             organisms.  This proposal is aimed toward understanding the mechanism           and regulation of eukaryotic flagellar movement.  The specific aim is to        determine how the dynein mechanochemical cycle regulates movement.  The         approach taken is to develop the use of compounds with specific effect          on dynein kinetics to study their effect on movement.  One compound             already identified for this study is the two-substituted ATP analog, 2-         C1 ATP.  In contrast to previously studied ATP analogs, 2-C1 ATP is a           surprisingly good substrate for dynein ATPase activity and supports             axonemal movement.  This and other analogs will be used to determine how        effects on dynein affect axonemal movement by studying their effect on          steps in the dynein-microtubule ATPase cycle and dynein-mediated                microtuble sliding.  This approach will allow elucidation of which step         in the dynein mechanochemical cycle may be associated with paramenters          of movement.                                                                                                                                                         Ciliary and flagellar motility is a fundamental kind of motility           which is critical to the lives of all kinds of eukaryotic organisms.            The simple protists, and spermatozoa, are propelled by this mechanism.          In higher animals, cilia are used move mucus to                                 better understand the molecular aspects of this remarkable                      biological function.",
