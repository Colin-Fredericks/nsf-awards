 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to advance the Baikal project by concentrating on                    characterization of the 150 samples currently in hand.  No travel               to the USSR is planned under the aegis of 1990-91 funding.  If                  results of our analytical work warrant additional field studies                 and collecting, we will formulate a new proposal based on these                 results.                                                                        The SMU portion of the project will focus on obtaining K-Ar                     dates, and on mineral chemistry.  The new dates are essential,                  because we intend to evaluate the geochemical variations among                  lavas in a temporal-spatial framework.  We have found the Soviet                dates to be completely unreliable.  I will contract for                         approximately 20 dates on whole-rock basalt samples.  As the                    whole-rock geochemistry and isotopic analyses will be done at                   Washington University, it is appropriate that the mineral                       chemistry work be done at SMU.  I will perform microprobe                       analyses of phenocrysts, xenocrysts, and xenoliths.                             The budget includes funds for travel to St. Louis in order to                   allow us to get together after the sample characterization phase,               integrate our data, and arrive at interpretations of the results.               Dr. Sergey Rasskazov, with whom we are collaborating, has been                  invited to spend a month in the laboratories of Luhr and Bowring                during late 1990 in order to maintain project momentum and                      facilitate cooperation.",
