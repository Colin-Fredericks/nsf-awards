 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sensitivity and selectivity of resonance-enhanced multi-                    photon ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy for detecting various                    chloro-ethylenes in a helium bath has been demonstrated in a                    previous grant.  Research is to be continued to determine the                   limits of the technique for gas samples containing more                         representative exhaust products.  REMPI will also be used to                    measure chlorinated flame radicals as a means to develop                        plausible chemical mechanisms for the production of toxic                       chlorinated hydrocarbons.  This data, coupled with the                          detection sensitivity studies, will assist in the selection of                  appropriate combustion surrogates for continuous incinerator                    monitoring.                                                                                                                                                     An issue central to the development of safe incineration of                     waste and hazardous organic materials is the control of                         emissions of undesirable chlorinated hydrocarbons.  Research                    is proposed to improve our ability to measure trace                             concentration of various CHCs, which attacks the problem at                     two levels:  providing high sensitivity continuous stack gas                    monitors, and sophisticated analytical techniques for                           laboratory measurement of flame radicals critical to                            unraveling toxic CHC species formation mechanisms.",
