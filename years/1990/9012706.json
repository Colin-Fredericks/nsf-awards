 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the PI plans to examine regional labor markets in              Japan, Great Britain and the United States and their response to                macroeconomic shocks.  He first plans to investigate adjustment of              real wages, unemployment or migration rates in response to shocks.              The effect of cultural and institutional factors that has an                    impact on labor market behavior will be mitigated by doing                      comparisons across regions within the same country.  The second                 part of the analysis will be an attempt to cast some light on the               causes of these differences in response patterns.  The PI will                  conduct some preliminary tests for the causes of the regional                   differentials by examining the roles of unions, housing markets,                industry structure, education or skill differentials and other                  factors.  After isolating which hypothesis appear to be most                    promising, he intends to develop a full proposal and test a                     theoretical model about why regional markets may vary in their                  responses to these shocks.  The investigator plans to link this                 work to current research on efficiency wages and insider-outsider               models of the labor market which have been used to explain                      aggregate unemployment and real wage movements.",
