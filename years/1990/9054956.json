 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER proposal will make it possible to sustain an effort by                precollege classroom teachers to investigate diagnosis of students'             knowledge and reasoning in physics and mathematics, especially as the           results of the diagnoses are used to guide subsequent instruction.              The project is an example of a practical interaction between research           on teaching and learning.  Development of instructional materials and           teacher development.  The investigators will revise and use an                  diagnostic teaching system (begun under an earlier private sector               grant) to build a knowledge base of student thinking from which                 interrelationships between thinking in various topic areas within               physics and between thinking in  physics and in mathematics.  The               assessment of student thinking will guide revision of instructional             materials and activities to make them more relevant to students'                initial conceptions and reasoning.  Four teachers, including the two            PIs, will interact as peer mentors addressing questions relevant                instruction.  Expected products include a publication on diagnosis of           student thinking in physics and mathematics and a paper about                   collaboration among peer teachers as a framework for developing more            reflective practitioners, for developing the teacher as researcher.",
