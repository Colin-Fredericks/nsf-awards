 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a clearly established need to perform work,                            remotely, in the undersea environment.  Typical tasks to                        be performed will range from observation and inspection to                      servicing defective undersea equipment, or recovering a                         lost item.                                                                                                                                                      While part of the work site may be structured, the                              environment is unstructured (the ocean).  In addition, the                      structured part of the work site may be damaged or in                           unknown condition.  This lack of structure, as well as the                      non-repetitive nature of the tasks, require constant                            adaptation to the environment.                                                                                                                                  This program involves research in the area of                                   teleoperation with the feedback delay that occurs with                          surface-based teleoperation in untethered submersibles.                         The delay in obtaining position and force feedback from                         remote slave arms makes operation extremely difficult.  A                       novel combination of graphics and manipulator programming                       will interface the teleoperator master arms to a graphics                       display of the remote environment.  The operator's actions                      will be monitored to provide both kinesthetic and visual                        feedback and to generate symbolic motion commands to the                        remote slave.                                                                                                                                                   The research will be performed jointly and in connection                        with, the French LAAS Laboratory in Toulouse, France.",
