 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent excavation and survey work by Drs. Edward Schortman and                  Patricia Urban in the Naco valley in Honduras has indicated the                 presence of a complex prehistoric polity which reached                          florescence in the late first and early second millennia A.D.  At               the central site of La Sierra, investigators noted 38 monumental                platforms in the core area and 468 constructions overall which                  date to the Late Classic period.  In the surrounding region, they               located a large number of sites, all of which are significantly                 smaller than La Sierra itself.  On this basis they suggested that               the site represents the capital of a state level polity which                   encompasses the entire valley and possibly extends beyond these                 physiographic limits.                                                                                                                                           With National Science Foundation support the team will continue                 their research in the Naco Valley.  Their goal is to understand                 the political mechanisms which permitted stratification and                     centralization to develop.  They believe that the economic system               was controlled by the elite and organized in such a way to                      maintain this domination.  This extended both to local craft                    production as well as importation of specialized commodities.  To               test this idea they will excavate a series of household groups                  both within and beyond La Sierra to determine the range and                     intensity of craft activities performed in different portions of                the polity.  These data will be correlated with site location in                relation to La Sierra and other indicators of household prestige.                                                                                               The research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  increase our understanding of how complex societies are                         developed, maintained, and eventually collapse.  The diachronic                 data which such archaeology can provide will shed a new light on                mechanisms of political control.  Secondly, the project will                    provide data from a relatively unknown area and these will be of                interest to a large number of archaeologists.  Finally, this                    project supports research at an undergraduate institution and                   will provide students firsthand exposure to the practice of                     science.",
