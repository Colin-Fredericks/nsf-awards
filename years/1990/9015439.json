This is one of               eleven winners under that competition.  This project is to develop a            system that allows rapid prototyping and evaluation of                          collaboration support structures.  It operates in the context of a              data browsing and information system based on the Trellis model of              hypertext.  Trellis uses a formally defined concurrent process                  model (nets) to implement hypertext.  This approach provides                    parallel automation semantics on tip of the features of the                     commonly used annotated directed graph.  A Trellis document has a               well defined and analyzable formal structure, and the concurrency               aspects of nets give Trellis the capability of managing groups of               interactive agents within the structure of a linked document.                   Trellis documents not only represent relations among information                elements, but also serve as the basis for construction of high-                 level cooperative process descriptions in which the agents of                   computation are coarse grained and of moderate speed and number.                This corresponds to groups of people interacting cooperatively on               the solution of a problem involving the browsing and manipulation               of information.                                                                 This project integrates collaboration support methods into                      hypertext documents and browsing.  The unique features and                      capabilities of the Trellis hypertext model, coupled with the                   proposed formal extensions and analysis techniques, make this not               only technically feasible, but especially appropriate and succinct.",
