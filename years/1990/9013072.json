 "awd_abstract_narration": "The muonic molecular ions having He as a nucleus do not                    form bound states.  However, their resonant states play a role                  in  muon catalyzed fusion.  They are considered scavengers of                   muons.  At very high densities these resonances may enhance                     the stripping of muons from muonic He when its kinetic energy                   has been slowed down after (dt\u001a) or (dd\u001a) fusion.  Quantitative                 investigation has been slowed down because very little is known                 about these resonances.  A variational method, developed for                    the accurate determination of the (dt\u001a) bound state properties,                 is well suited for studying these resonances.  Excellent                        resonance energies and widths have already been computed for a                  number of resonant states of (dt\u001a)+ below the n=2 threshold of                  (d\u001a) and (t\u001a).  Preliminary calculations indicate the existence                 of similar resonances in (.d\u001a)++ and (3Hed\u001a)++.  The proposed                   research will provide accurate positions, widths and other                      properties of all these resonances.",
