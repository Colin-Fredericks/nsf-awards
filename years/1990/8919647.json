 "awd_abstract_narration": "The greatest uncertainty of carbon budgets in forest                       ecosystems appears to be in the magnitude and factors                           controlling partitioning of carbon to above- versus belowground                 production.  Dr. Gower, Running, and Gholz propose to measure                   key carbon budget indices at four forests of widely contrasting                 climate (each with control and fertilized stands).  Their                       analyses will concentrate on relative carbon budgets of the                     contrasting sites, produced by identical measurements, rather                   than a detailed carbon budget on one site.  They will estimate                  above- and belowground net primary production and indices of                    canopy photosynthetic production and stem, branch, and root                     respiration losses of conifer forests in Oregon, Montana,                       Wisconsin and Florida.  An established ecosystem process model                  that calculates water, carbon and nitrogen cycles in forests                    will be used to integrate field data, interpolate between                       measurement periods and evaluate their hypotheses on variable                   carbon partitioning patterns in diverse climates.  Detailed                     data from an on-going intensive study at the Florida site will                  be used to place their relative budgets into context.  Results                  should provide improved fundamental understanding of                            environmental controls on forest productivity, allowing better                  projections of forest responses to perturbations such as air                    pollution and climate change.",
