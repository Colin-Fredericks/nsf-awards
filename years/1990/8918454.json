 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rust fungi are plant pathogens that are responsible for                several economically important diseases of pines and their                      conifer relatives.  The taxonomy and phylogeny of rust fungi are                controversial because the organisms are small, with few                         discernible morphological differences, and they have complex life               histories with several spore-bearing stages.  Dr. Thomas Bruns of               the University of California-Berkeley will use modern molecular                 techniques to investigate evolutionary relationships among rust                 fungi of the major family Melampsoraceae.  He has developed                     methods that allow specific amplification of DNA from small                     amounts of fungal material, even from preserved specimens, and                  with this refinement plant-host DNA will no longer interfere with               the study of the fungus.                                                             Selected nuclear and mitochondrial genes of numerous species               of rust fungi will be analyzed for their nucleotide sequences,                  and these will be compared using computer programs to generate a                likely phylogenetic framework for related species.  The phylogeny               thus constructed for the fungi will then be compared to current                 notions of pine species phylogeny to test the idea that fungal                  parasites and host pines have evolved in association                            (\"coevolution\") through geological time.  In addition, the                      molecular analyses will provide unique genetic markers of                       individual rust-fungus species, valuable for purposes of accurate               identification in other taxonomic and ecological studies.",
