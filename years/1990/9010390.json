 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop an approach to                      better design of systems for decontamination of                                 groundwater than is now generally in use for remediation                        of aquifers contaminated by seepage from hazardous wastes                       sites.  The procedure being developed in this project is                        directed toward optimizing the number and location of                           wells and for determination of the pumping rates to be                          used during the remediation process.  It will also include                      an algorithm for including installation and construction                        costs in the economic description of the proposed system.                                                                                                       The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord                      with the NSF Program Announcement:  Research Initiation                         Awards, NSF 88-99.  Results are expected to provide an                          approach that can be used to improve the engineering                            design of systems for decontamination of groundwater                            aquifers.  It is expected to have an advantage over                             procedures now being used for determination of the number,                      location and pumping rates of remediation wells.  Results                       of this research may also be applied to engineering design                      of systems to protect aquifers from potential                                   contamination by seepage from hazardous waste disposal                          sites.",
