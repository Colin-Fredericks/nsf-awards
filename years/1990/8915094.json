 "awd_abstract_narration": "In studies of midwater trawl samples, large numbers of endemic                  bathypelagic calanoid species have been found in the Antarctic,                 all of which were more abundant than the cosmopolitan species                   found in the same area.  These findings are contrary to the                     general perception that the bathypelagic calanoids are are                      cosmopolitan and rare because of the uniformity of physical                     condition and the scarcity of available food in deep waters                     throughout the world's oceans.  A possible explanation is that                  the Antarctic bathypelagic endemic species are those adapted to                 euthrophic conditions of the Antarctic, whereas the                             cosmopolitan species are those adapted to oligotrophic                          conditions.  The study  proposed here is to test the hypothesis                 by investigation of the   deep-living calanoids concerning                      their morphology, geographic distribution, and relative                         abundance at many different locations of the world's oceans.                    Both eutrophic upwelling and oligotrophic oceanic areas will be                 examined for comparison of the effect of general productivity                   of overlaying surface waters.  The calanoid genera selected for                 the study are Euchaeta, Pseudochirella and Onchocalanus.  These                 genera have already been studied in the Antarctic and found to                  be important constituents of the bathpelagic calanoid                           assemblage, with many endemic as well as cosmopolitan species.                  The samples for the study will be selected mainly from midwater                 trawl collections available at the Smithsonian Oceanographic                    sorting Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The                    study will accomplish two objectives:  1) Answering the                         question of whether the bathypelagic calanoid assemblages                       comprise, as in the epipelagic communities, eutrophic endemic                   species confined to waters of high productivity and                             cosmopolitan oligotrophic species ranging widely in the world's                 oceans. 2) Clarifying the systematics and biogeography of some                  bathypelagic calanoid taxa, important but poorly known groups                   in the zooplankton.",
