 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a systematic and integrated petrographic,                          hydrologic, and hydrochemical study of carbonate cementation in                 the Ocala and Suwannee Limestones of the upper Floridan aquifer                 in southwestern Florida.  The objectives are to determine (1) if                cements are forming and if so, why, (2) what is the source of the               cements, and (3) how the cementation history of these rocks                     relates to hydrogeochemical history of the aquifer.  Work                       includes evaluation of the distribution, nature, and geochemical                signatures of the aquifer cements and the relationship of these                 attributes to the hydrology and hydrochemistry of the aquifer.                  The diagenetic products will be characterized by standard                       petrographic techniques, and microprobe and isotopic analyses.                  The hydrology and hydrochemistry will be investigated using                     existing data.  Groundwater flow paths, flow volumes, and                       chemical mass fluxes will be calculated.  Chemical evolution                    along flow paths will be compared to the traversed geology and                  cement geochemistry.                                                                 The result of this study will be an actualistic, predictive                model of carbonate cementation in a modern, regional carbonate                  aquifer.  The results will tell what happens diagenetically,                    where, and why.  This will be the first comprehensive                           investigation of a modern, regional, confined aquifer with                      respect to cementation.  As such, it will serve as a test of the                ideas and models derived from the many examples of carbonate                    cementation in ancient regional aquifers.",
