 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major area of research of this grant is wave                                scattering from rough surfaces with emphasis on                                 numerical studies of rough surface scattering                                   models with the objective of developing a                                       surface scattering model that accurately predicts                               acoustic wave scattering, first from the ocean                                  surface and later from the ocean bottom.                                        Ultimately, what is needed is a model that will                                 work for the most general type of boundary                                      condition and that can be used for                                              electromagnetic waves as well as acoustic and                                   optical waves.  This is a very difficult problem                                which researchers have been working on for                                      decades.  It is only with the recent introduction                               of high-speed computers and workstations that                                   a solution has become practicable.  In particular                               investigation into such problems as the detection                               of ship wakes and the estimation of wave height                                 and direction will be carried out.  Co-                                         investigators will include a physical                                           oceanographer, a signal processor, a fluid                                      dynamicist, a fluid experimentalist, and                                        acoustician, a surface scattering modeler and are                               currently searching for a remote sensing                                        experimentalist and an image processor to fill                                  positions in the electrical engineering                                         department.",
