 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is on physical design and synthesis of IC's, and on reliable           IC designs.  Theory of VLSI design model and methodologies is being             used to understand layout problems for complex IC designs.  Research            problems being addressed include:  multi-layer routing, pin assignment,         placement of flexible modules, module orientation, and placement of             standard cells.  Two approaches to reliable designs are being                   investigated.  The first is to identify minimal sets of redundant               elements that are needed to replace defective elements in both                  homogeneous and non-homogeneous arrays.  The minimal sets are called            minimum covering sets.  Second is an effort to develop a general model          for fault coverage problems in reconfigurable chips.  The model is              capable of capturing a large class of possible relationships between            redundant elements and defective elements.",
