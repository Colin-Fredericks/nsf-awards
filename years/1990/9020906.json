This two year               project is approved by and reporting to the Center's Industry                   Advisory Board.                                                                      The research is 1.) developing the guidelines for designing                or modifying a part to comply with a proposed new method for easy               and reliable recognition of an isolated object on a flat surface,               by a robot fitted with a retroreflective vision sensor; 2.)                     designing and modifying specific components, suggested by the                   interested member companies of the Material Handling Research                   Center of Georgia Tech, using above guidelines; 3.) conducting                  experiments in part recognition and handling using an IBM robot,                IBM AT, and Georgia Tech's Landmark Tracking Camera with                        retroreflective vision sensing; and 4.) developing preliminary                  metrics to compare alternate designs of a part on the basis of                  recognizability and cycle time for handling by going through the                iterative procedure of guidelines, design, test and metrics.                         The researcher is competent and has the facilities available               to perform the research.                                                             The Program Manager recommends Tuskegee University be awarded              $100,000 for two (2) years.",
