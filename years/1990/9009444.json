This project involves extensive measurements                                    of long-period microtremors in the San                                          Francisco basin.  Microtremors, or                                              microseisms, are small tremors or vibrations                                    of the earth that are generated by natural                                      occurrences such as the pounding of surf on                                     the shore, or road traffic.  They can be                                        detected only by sensitive instruments and                                      are not associated with earthquakes, but may                                    be used to understand better the process of                                     ground shaking due to earthquakes.  The aim                                     is to investigate the use of long-period                                        microtremors in the San Francisco basin to                                      identify \"critical\" structures having a                                         natural frequency of vibration close to that                                    of the predominant motion of the basin.                                                                                                                         The program consists of three phases: (1) The                                   measurement of long-period microtremors at                                      approximately 30 locations within the basin,                                    with some of the sites coinciding with the                                      locations were strong motion records were                                       obtained during the Loma Prieta earthquake,                                     (2) processing these data, and (3) analyzing                                    these data and comparing them with the strong                                   ground motion records obtained during the                                       Loma Prieta earthquake.  Special emphasis is                                    being given to the Marina district which                                        consists of very soft sediments and in which                                    considerable damage occurred.                                                                                                                                   All recorded data are being stored on floppy                                    disks, which will be available upon request.                                    In addition, the records will be accessible                                     through electronic mail.",
