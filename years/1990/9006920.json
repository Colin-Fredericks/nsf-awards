 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports Organization of the topical meeting on Integrated           Optics, Monterey, CA, July 30 - Aug. 1, 1990.  This topical meeting             will highlight the area of Optoelectronic Integrated Circuits (OEICs),          which are circuits that monolithically integrate optical and                    electronic components on a single semiconductor chip.  OEICs represent          a device technology which has the potential to make a major impact in           future telecommunications and computing systems requirements.  There            are major challenges in materials growth and device fabrication that            are presented by the integration of very different devices on a single          chip.  The Japanese have made significant advances in this technology,          particulary because of the strengths of their leading industrial firms          active in optoelectronics, whereas in the United States the efforts             have been very fragmented.  The goal of this topical meeting is to              bring together researchers and students working on OEICs, from                  industry, government labs, and academia, to discuss the latest                  developments in the field, to assess the potential of the technology            and the problems related to fabrication, and to stimulate the creation          of collaborative efforts.  The meeting will focus on materials and              fabrication issues as well as systems applications.",
