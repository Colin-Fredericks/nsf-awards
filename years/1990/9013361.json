Parametric theories of grammar must be                       compatible with the varieties of language in a diglossia, and                   statements of the variation in a diglossia should also integrate                with the parametric properties of grammatical theory.  As an                    approach to this problem, this research proposes a notion of                    \"functional articulation\", which allows a formal theory of                      grammar to be informed by language use patterns, by associating                 different grammatical features with different communicative                     attitudes.  This notion will be developed in a detailed study of                Sinhala diglossia.  Sinhala has been chosen since it exhibits                   theoretically significant differences between its two main                      varieties, and intermediate varieties of language required to                   test hypotheses based on functional articulation.  The study will               examine samples of the language found in a wide range of contexts               (e.g. textbooks, newspapers, broadcast news, advertising,                       personal and formal letters, sermons, speeches, literatures,                    etc.).  Comparison and cross-referencing of selected texts will                 be facilitated by HyperCard.  The distribution of several                       grammatical features over the different contexts will be analyzed               in terms of their functional correlates and current grammatical                 theory, focusing on the relationship between agreement and case.                The study will address the implications of functional                           articulation for modern theories of grammatical universals, and                 the implications for other diglossic language situations,                       education, and language teaching.",
