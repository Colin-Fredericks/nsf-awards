 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to improve the modeling of urban                 traffic congestion, with an emphasis on the travel decisions made               by commuters traveling by automobile.  The ultimate goal is to                  construct a practical and theoretically sound simulation model in               which road pricing and other policies can be evaluated.  This                   research builds on earlier work in which roads are modeled as                   bottlenecks with fixed flow capacity.  Six extensions of this                   model will be pursued: 1) Incorporating directly the arrival time               preferences  of commuters by modeling the interaction between                   workers in the city center.  Staggered working hours and                        flexitime policies are considered as ways of spreading out                      commuting trips and reducing congestion, 2) Evaluating the gains                from tolls and capacity expansion using more realistic models of                traffic flow in which flow is density-dependent, 3) Investigation               of the circumstances under which traffic flows become                           hypercongested, 4) Addition of a parking module to the bottleneck               model to determine the effect of parking fees and walking time on               trip time decisions and to improve the understanding of the                     interaction between parking congestion and moving-traffic                       congestion, 5) Analysis of simple road networks, 6) Evaluation of               the welfare effects or route guidance systems, whereby real-time                information and advice is provided to drivers on traffic                        conditions.  This project is important because it will enhance                  our ability to plan and more effectively manage our                             transportation system.",
