 "awd_abstract_narration": "Haught will continue her investigation of the degree                       structures induced by strengthenings of Turing computability.                   These strengthenings are obtained by placing size restrictions on               various aspects of a Turing calculation.  In particular, she is                 interested in truth table reducibility, weak truth table                        reducibility, and polynomial-time bounded Turing reducibility.                  She plans to develop technical methods for solving structural                   questions about the degrees, and to analyze the degree structures               in terms of the proof techniques which are appropriate to the                   structures.  In this way she hopes to uncover heretofore hidden                 connections among the various degree structures.                                     Other aspects of the project are a continuation of Haught's                study of the interactions between model theory and recursion                    theory in the setting of reverse mathematics, and an                            investigation of the properties of introreducible sets, but the                 major effort will be invested in understanding what it means for                a proposition to be unprovable, making use of the various                       idealizations of computability cited above.",
