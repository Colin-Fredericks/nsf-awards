 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will continue the measurement of trace atmospheric                   gases that are considered to be important to the formation of the               annual antarctic ozone hole and also are important for controlling              the Earth's radiation balance.  Two techniques will be used.  At                McMurdo, in conjunction with the New Zealand Antarctic Research                 Program, infrared absorption measurements using the sun as an                   infrared radiation source will continued during the time of the                 ozone hole, as they have for the past few years.  A new instrument              has been installed at South Pole that will measure emitted                      atmospheric infrared radiation in the winter (polar night) as well              as absorbed solar radiation in the summer.  This instrument will                be operated every day.  In both cases the wave number region to be              covered will be 750-4000 inverse centimeters.  The gases that                   should be detected include hydrochloric acid, nitric acid,                      nitrogen dioxide, chlorine nitrate, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone               and the chlorofluorocarbons 11 and 12 (F11 and F12) during the                  time of the ozone hole and the total column abundances over South               Pole of nitric acid, ozone, water vapor, F11 and F12 on a                       continuous basis for the entire year.                                                                                                                           The measurements are not only important for achieving a better                  understanding of the stratospheric chemistry that causes the ozone              depletion but also for determining how radiatively important trace              species (RITS) are affecting the Earth's climate.                                                                                                               This research is jointly supported by the Atmospheric Chemistry                 and Polar Aeronomy and Astrophysics programs at NSF and also by                 the Upper Atmospheric Research Program at NASA.",
