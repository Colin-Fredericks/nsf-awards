 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Outreach Network will provide school                  children, teachers, and the general public with highly                          accessible interactive exhibits dealing with popular topics in                  science and technology.  The network, initiated as a                            partnership between regional science centers and public                         libraries, will be modeled after the highly successful                          statewide Oregon Library Exhibits Network established in 1987.                  Through this smaller network, the Oregon Museum of Science and                  Industry, a nationally recognized pioneer in science exhibitry                  and outreach programming, circulates small hands-on exhibits to                 rural population centers through installations in public                        libraries, where school groups and families have free and                       convenient access.                                                                                                                                                   This national dissemination project will be initiated in                   five regional sites across the country (Colorado, Minnesota,                    New York, Tennessee, and Oregon) to further establish the model                 in rural, inner-urban, economically disadvantaged, and                          culturally diverse regions.  With support from both the NSF and                 the regional networks, The National Science Outreach Network                    will design and duplicate six exhibits for circulation to                       dozens of local communities in each designated region.  Over                    the next seven years, over six million individuals, many of                     whom do not currently frequent a local science center, will be                  introduced to popular science in a non-threatening, resource-                   rich setting.  This will encourage further exploration and                      possible future visits to an accessible science center, and                     ultimately establish an ever-expanding network of museum and                    non-museum partners providing science and technology learning                   opportunities to millions of individuals each year.",
