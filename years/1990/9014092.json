 "awd_abstract_narration": "The earliest known remains of anatomically modern humans occur in               Africa.  These remains are associated with people practicing                    Middle Stone Age (MSA) activities.  The most intensive research                 on MSA peoples has been in the Cape Province of South Africa, but               remains also have been uncovered in the Katanda area of the                     Semliki Valley in eastern Zaire.  The Katanda sites are                         associated with fish remains, which suggest that aquatic                        resources may have been used much earlier than is evident at the                South African sites.  One of the Katanda sites also has yielded                 six barbed bone points, which are estimated to date from about                  40,000 years before the present, the earliest known record of                   complex bone technology.  This grant will permit further                        excavation of paleosol-related remains at the most productive of                the Katanda sites.  It also will permit surveying and mapping of                the paleosol horizon along a roughly three kilometer exposure in                order to place the archaeological findings in a broader regional                context, and it will enable use of dosimeters and additional                    samples to determine more accurately the age of these MSA                       horizons.                                                                                                                                                       This project will expand on the work of previously sponsored                    excavations from a very promising site, which already has shed                  new light on Middle Stone Age peoples in central Africa.  This                  work will contribute to our knowledge about the specific features               of this site, and it also will contribute to our more general                   understandings of the processes by which evolution of modern                    humans was related to the development of new technologies and the               exploitation of new environments and food sources.",
