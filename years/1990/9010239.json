 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are the synthesis of                        digitally implemented demodulator architectures which achieve                   near ideal coherent digital communication performance in the                    frequency nonselective slow fading channel.  Coherent digital                   communication performance provides a 3 dB improvement over the                  most commonly utilized fading channel demodulation architecture,                differentially coherent detection.  Digitally implemented                       architectures are the best method of achieving this coherent                    performance since they possess many practical and theoretical                   advantages.                                                                          The first stage of this project focuses on the development                 of generalized algorithms for carrier estimation and symbol                     demodulation.  This work is developing phase estimation                         algorithms optimized for the fading channel and a carrier with                  frequency uncertainty.  In the second phase symbol timing                       estimation and joint phase and symbol timing estimation on the                  fading channel is being investigated.  The work will help produce               modems with near optimal performance on the fading channel with                 many practical advantages.",
