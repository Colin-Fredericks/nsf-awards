 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                     chemistry and in the subfield of mass spectrometric studies of                  gas phase metal ion molecule chemistry.  Professor Ben S.                       Freiser will study new methods for the production and                           characterization of the reactions taking place between metal                    ions and organic molecules in the gas phase, using Fourier                      transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry.  The                       results of these studies will advance the means to describe the                 relationship between the chemistry of small metal clusters                      (groups of a few atoms) and organic species.  This is of                        relevance to photographic processes, catalysis, atmospheric                     chemistry and processing in microelectronics.                                                                                                                   Continuation of previous work will include the development of a                 new pulsed supersonic ion source for creation and studies of                    cluster ions of particular stabilities.  Studies of mixed metal                 dimers and trimers reacting with simple hydrocarbons will be                    extended to more complicated cluster species as they can be                     produced in the laser vaporization/supersonic expansion source.                 Thermodynamic stabilities (i.e. so-called endothermic reactions                 thresholds) will be determined for particular metal                             cluster-hydrocarbon reactions, for example hydrogen                             abstraction, with the FTMS as the coincident detector of                        multiple products.  This latter feature is an important point                   in the study of these reactions.",
