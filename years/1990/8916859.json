 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work involves a new approach for the determination of                  absolute magnetic paleointensity.  Principally, the method                      deviates from that of the classical Thellier approach in that not               one, but several sub-samples are utilized per determination.                    Each specimen is heated only twice to an individually-assigned                  temperature.  Thus, the primary advantage of the method over the                Thellier is that progressive physicochemical alteration due to                  serial heatings is held to a minimum.  Indeed, an initial study                 utilizing the new method suggests that it can furnish reliable                  results when the Thellier approach may fail.  As has been the                   case with past research in Undergraduate Institution (RUI)                      grants, the project will be assisted by several undergraduate                   physics majors.  Past experience has shown that the majority of                 students which have assisted in paleomagnetic projects at Cal                   Poly successfully continue their academic careers at graduate                   institutions in geophysics or physics.",
