 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of both field and laboratory research intends                 to determine whether damage-induced changes in oak leaf traits                  have a net negative or positive influence on the gypsy moth (GM).               Previous work demonstated that damage-induced increases in leaf                 phenolics can depress larval growth and adult fecundity by 30% or               more (Rossiter et al. 1988).  Thus tree responses could have a                  negative impact on GM populations.  Phenolic levels even lower                  than those exhibited by induced tree leaves strongly inhibit                    infection of GM larvae by the Gypsy Moth Nuclear Polyhedrosis                   Virus (GMNPV).  Hence, the possibility exists that induced                      \"defenses\" in oaks actually benefit the GM.  These studies are                  designed to compare these two effects and provide information                   allowing us to infer the net influence of induction - positive or               negative - on the GM.  The project team will use GM larvae to                   generate damage-induced changes in leaf traits, rear larvae on                  induced and control leaves, and assess the influence of these                   diets on GMNPV effectiveness.  The results will permit a                        comparison of induction's ability to reduce fecundity with its                  impact on mortality in GM populations, and will clarify the                     relationship between hostplant chemistry and the success of this                forest pest.  Results will contribute to ecological theory on                   pathogen/plant/animal interactions and will be of immediate                     interest to forest managers.//",
