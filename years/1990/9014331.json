 "awd_abstract_narration": "Short term load forecasting is an important and complex task requiring          in-depth understanding of the technique and the system.  Many                   statistical and expert system based techniques produce fairly accurate          forecast.  However, most statistical techniques are computationally             burdensome as these methods need updating with changing conditions.             Expert systems are more adaptable to changing conditions, but it is             not always easy to express the available expertise (knowledge) in               clear quantitative terms, often leading to inconsistent rules.                                                                                                  The objective of this research is to develop a new load forecasting             technique which combines the capabilities of both the expert systems            approach and the statistical techniques, but avoids their drawbacks.            Expert systems approach is adopted to utilize the available body of             knowledge to form a subset of historical data which are most pertinent          to the forecast point.  The priority vector method, explained in the            proposal, is applied to quantitatively express any qualitative factors          involved in the process.  This approach is fundamentally different              from the others, because we create subsets of historical data                   according to the conditions at the forecast point, instead of the               traditional approach of analyzing the whole historical data set.                Further, the updating function becomes automatic in our technique               since the subset of data is continually reconstructed and the                   relationships redetermined to match each forecast point.                                                                                                        The development of the technique in its simplest form is outlined and           the application is demonstrated in weekly load forecast.  We have               identified and briefly discussed the areas which need further work to           make the model sophisticated for better performance, and to extend it           to perform interval forecasting.",
