 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Education Board (MSEB) is a board of the              National Academy of Sciences (NAS) enabled to coordinate and assist the         process of mathematics education reform in the United States.  MSEB is          charged with building alliances, promoting cooperation, and encouraging         national, regional, and local projects.                                                                                                                         The MSEB will pursue the following goals to provide:  (1) leadership of         continuing efforts to improve mathematical sciences nationally; (2)             coordination among existing mathematics education projects; (3) service         to localities and states, through assistance in determining curricular          goals and higher standards for all students, and improving teacher              preparation; (4) recommendations of ways to strengthen weak parts of the        infrastructure of mathematics education; (5) information to increase            public understanding of the rapidly changing missions and character of          the mathematical sciences; and (6) advice to federal, state, and local          agencies on long-range goals and needs in mathematical sciences                 education.                                                                                                                                                      In order to pursue these goals, the present proposal will fund five             major initiatives (Leader Initiative):  school mathematics projects,            college/university projects, state and local networks, minority                 programs, and general outreach.  NAS currently supports the executive           director and staff of MSEB, NSF will support the five major initiatives         plus policy formation, strategic planning, and project creation by the          Board and its working committees.  Support for project implementation is        obtained through separate grants from foundations and agencies both             private and public.",
