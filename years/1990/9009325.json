 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a honey bee colony, the workers are physiologically capable of               laying eggs that develop into males, but in colonies with a queen               nearly all reproduction, both males and females, is through the                 queen.  This seemingly conflicts with the genetic interest of                   individual workers, who are more closely related to their own                   sons than to their mother's sons, and might thus gain greater                   evolutionary fitness by laying eggs themselves.  Dr. Visscher's                 research will examine what interactions underlie the lack of                    worker reproduction, and will test the hypothesis that this                     colony-level cooperation in reproduction is the result of mutual                \"policing\" by sister workers.  \"Policing,\" or bees preventing the               reproduction of their sisters in favor of their mother, may raise               the costs and lower the potential benefits of attempting personal               reproduction, so that the inherently conflicting interests of                   workers are realigned.  This \"forced cooperation\" in turn would                 facilitate further evolution of cooperative behavior, enhancing                 selection for workers to increase their inclusive fitness by                    increasing colony resources through cooperation, rather than                    manipulating colony resources toward their personal reproduction.                                                                                               Honey bees are of economic importance as producers of honey and                 especially as pollinators of many agricultural crops.  Dr.                      Visscher's research will contribute to knowlege of their                        reproductive biology, which may prove useful in bee breeding or                 in genetic control of honey bees with undesirable traits, such as               Africanized honey bees.                                                                                                                                         This research also will contribute to the general theory of                     social behavior.  Understanding how genetic conflicts among                     individuals in an insect society are resolved will shed light on                how highly cooperative social behavior has evolved.",
