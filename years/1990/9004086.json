The New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ), located                                     at the northern edge of the embayment, is                                       well known for its seismically active buried                                    faults.  The earthquakes that occur in the                                      NMSZ are characterized by a long recurrence                                     period and low seismic wave attenuation (the                                    effect of an earthquake is felt at large                                        distances from the epicenter).                                                                                                                                  The damaging effects of earthquakes are                                         intimately associated with the dynamic                                          properties of the surficial soils, most                                         notably the stiffness and damping properties.                                   These properties are a major component to                                       regional seismic risk assessment studies.                                       The damage is most often a result of                                            amplification of the ground surface shaking                                     as a result of the coincidence between a                                        natural mode of the soil profile and the                                        dominant frequency of incident seismic waves;                                   or of the liquefaction of water-saturated                                       granular deposits near the ground surface.                                                                                                                      The dynamic soil properties for the data base                                   come from several sources: the laboratory                                       test program; data and soil samples provided                                    by local sources; and field work to collect                                     special soil samples.  The data have many                                       applications in earthquake hazard mitigation,                                   including the design of earthquake resistant                                    structures, the retrofit of existing                                            structures, and revision of the current                                         building codes for the urban development                                        projects in the Mid-south.",
