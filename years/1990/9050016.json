 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's focus is the development and evaluation of five                   units that integrate mathematical content and pedagogical                       strategies in mathematics.  The units are designed to                           illustrate topics in mathematics (distributivity, functions,                    Pythagorean theorem, basic combinatorics, and applications of                   modeling) that are central to the current secondary school                      mathematics curriculum, while offering excellent vehicles for                   illustrating new thrusts outlined by NCTM Standards.  These                     units will provide preservice teachers with opportunities to                    see connections between a variety of mathematical topics and                    their applications; to experience the learning of mathematics                   with an eye toward structuring that mathematics for teaching;                   and to construct a vision of mathematics as a human activity                    built from reflection, activity, and modification of                            perceptions.                                                                                                                                                    The activities of the project will involve developing the                       units taking into consideration significant content at the                      secondary school level and elements of problem posing,                          problem solving, various mathematical representations and                       pedagogical approaches, and available technology where                          appropriate.  The units will be field tested at three                           American universities and will be reviewed by outstanding                       teachers, teacher educators, and mathematicians. Reports will                   be written on the impact of the units on the preservice                         teachers' conceptions of mathematics and the teaching of                        mathematics as they engage the units.                                                                                                                           The units will be developed by an international team of                         mathematics educators and mathematicians, all experienced in                    writing materials for perservice teachers.                                                                                                                      The cost sharing has been negotiated to the level of 26.7% of                   the funds requested from NSF.",
