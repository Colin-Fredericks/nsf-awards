 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical sediments dominated by iron(III) oxides are a                          manifestation of the unique combination of abundant free oxygen                 and liquid water found in the surface and many near-surface                     environments of Earth.  Research performed in this laboratory has               shown that the stable isotope ratios of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon             in certain iron(III) oxides contain information on ancient                      temperatures, sources of water and organic contributions to aqueous             carbonate systems associated with iron(III) oxide precipitation.                In addition trapped CO2 abundance data from geothites may be related            to ambient CO2 partial pressures at the time of mineral formation.              The oxygen isotope systematics of ubiquitous phosphate-iron(III)                oxide pairs will be studied to determine if they contain                        information on paleotemperatures.  Knowledge obtained from this and             our previous studies of iron(III) oxides will be applied to                     isotopic, chemical and attendant petrographic investigations of                 Phanerozoic oolitic ironstones, recent bacterially mediated                     iron(III) oxide precipitate and Late Precambrian banded iron                    formation(BIF).  Fe(III) carbonate abundance and carbon-13                      variations in a Late Ordovician weathering surface could provide                knowledge of ambient CO2 partial pressures and the role of organic              matter in this ancient environment.  Oxygen, hydrogen and carbon                abundance and isotopic data from tropical oolitic ironstones that               date from global \"greenhouse\" and \"icehouse\" intervals in the                   Phanerozoic will be obtained.  The ancient tropical temperatures                and sources of water will be compared for the deposits that                     represent these putative global climatic extremes.  Oxygen isotopic             measurements of a Late Precambrian quartz-hematite BIF should                   provide insight into the depositional environment of this deposit.              Paleoclimatic data of the type to be obtained in this research are              essential to an ultimate understanding of the possible link between             global tectonics and the types of climatic regimes that could                   produce apparent tropical continental ice sheets in the Late                    Precambrian or polar ice sheets in the Late Ordovician.",
