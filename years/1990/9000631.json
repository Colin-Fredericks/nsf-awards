 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the relationship                     between the spectrum of the Laplacian of a manifold and the                     geometry of that manifold.  This will include an investigation of               the relationship between the spectrum and geometric properties                  such as diameter and injectivity radius, as well as a trace                     formula for Riemannian manifolds.  The project will include a                   study of eigenvalue estimates in the context of obtaining                       finiteness and compactness results for isospectral manifolds.                        The problems to be addressed in this project are extensions                of Mark Kac's famous question, \"Can you hear the shape of a                     drum?\"  Mathematicians would ask if the spectrum of sound                       frequencies radiating from a drum can be used to distinguish                    between different shaped drums.  In two dimensions these                        frequencies can be used to make such distinctions, but in higher                dimensions they can not.  The principal investigator will study                 whether or not other mathematical distinctions between objects                  other than their exact shapes, can be determined by an analysis                 of their sound spectrums.",
