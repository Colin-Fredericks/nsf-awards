 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator intends to extend the investigation of the                     principal-agent model in the context of oligopolistic firms that                contract with retailers.  The retailers provide services to the                 (oligopolist) firm in the form of advertising, maintenance or the               provision of warranties. Because the firm cannot observe the                    level of effort that the retailer expends, nor does the firm                    have direct access to information about demand and retailing                    cost, the problems of moral hazard and adverse selection can be                 studied. Some important questions in industrial organization are                studied in the context of this model. Specifically, it will look                at how the form of competition among retailers affects: the                     willingness of the firms to delegate decisions to the retailers,                the incentives of firms to monitor their agents, the marketing                  efforts of agents and the profits of firms and retailers.                                                                                                       In the context of this same model, the issue of vertical                        restraints are analyzed. The study will see how the restraint                   selected depends upon the degree of differentiation among                       products, the relative efficiency of retailers and firms, and the               relative precision of the information known only to the                         retailers.",
