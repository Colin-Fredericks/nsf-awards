The traditional                                                 approach (gain scheduling) is an                                                arduous, multi-step process: multiple                                           linear controllers are employed in an                                           ad hoc fashion requiring substantial                                            manual adjustment.  Although an                                                 extensive and well-developed theory                                             exists for linear systems, a similarly                                          effective theory for nonlinear control                                          system design remains elusive.  A                                               further difficulty arises after the                                             control system has been designed.                                               Because the physical models used                                                during the design process rarely                                                accurately reflect the actual plant                                             dynamics, extensive on-line manual                                              tuning of the nominal control system                                            is required to ultimately achieve                                               satisfactory performance.                                                                                                                                       Artificial neural networks (ANNs)                                               offer unique capabilities that may be                                           exploited to overcome the limitations                                           of conventional nonlinear control                                               system design methods; namely, the                                              inability to accommodate spatial                                                nonlinearities and adapt to time-                                               varying dynamics.  The potential                                                benefits of practical neurocontrol                                              systems apply to a wide assortment of                                           complex nonlinear systems and                                                   processes; these include atmospheric                                            and underwater vehicles, manufacturing                                          processes, and robotic systems.  For                                            such applications, a neurocontrol                                               system might be used advantageously to                                          synthesize the required nonlinear                                               feedback control law automatically,                                             objectively, and near-optimally (given                                          the appropriate reinforcement).  To                                             fully realize the potential benefits                                            of this approach, new conceptual and                                            empirical tools for designing and                                               analyzing ANNs for feedback control                                             will have to be developed.                                                                                                                                      The main objective of this project is                                           to develop the techniques, algorithms,                                          and theory required to  implement ANNs                                          for the control of complex multi-                                               input/multi-output systems having                                               spatial nonlinearities and time-                                                varying dynamics.  An important                                                 underlying is to develop a sound                                                theoretical framework that may be used                                          to refine, formalize, and extend                                                research results in this area.",
