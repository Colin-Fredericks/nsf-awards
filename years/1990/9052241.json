 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern methods of data acquisition and analysis are being provided              to undergraduate physiology laboratories. This equipment is not only            enhancing existing laboratory experiments, but is also increasing the           number of experiments performed while providing quantifiable data and           access to software commonly used in scientific analysis.                        Physiological transducers are attached to a commercially available              data acquisition system that is connected to a personal computer.               Each system enables two student groups to utilize one computer                  system. Software simulations and mathematical models are also used              to enhance comprehension. The integration of computer-based                     acquisition equipment should reduce the frustration level that many             students experienced with the previous equipment. The university will           contribute an amount equal to the award.",
