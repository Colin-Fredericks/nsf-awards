 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have isolated a hyper-recombination mutants, TOP3 that                       identifies a novel eukaryotic topoisomerase in the yeast,                       Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  The predicted open reading frame of                  the TOP3 gene is homologous to the bacterial type, I                            topoisomerase, TopA, but not homologous to eukaryotic type I or                 II enzymes.  We plan to investigate  the biochemical properties                 of this novel enzyme and to define its substrate preferences.                   Null mutations exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes such as slow                      growth, reduced diploid formation and a sporulation defect.  We                 will investigate the consequences of these pleiotropies by                      examining mitotic and meiotic nuclear division, spindle formation               and the mating reaction.  Genetic experiments will address these                pleiotropies by in vitro mutagenesis of the TOP3 gene and by                    searching for genetic suppressors of these phenotypes.  A slow                  growth suppressor, sgs1, has already been isolated and will be                  cloned and mapped using a modified Ty mutagenesis method that we                will develop.  Lastly, we will begin to investigate whether the                 TOP3 gene is a general feature of all cell by attempting to                     identify a homologue in the evolutionarily distant yeast                        Schizosaccharomyces pombe by using either nucleic acid homology                 or protein homology as a probe.  It is our goal to understand the               role that this novel topoisomerase plays in cells growth and                    development.  The process of genetic recombination is observed in               all living organisms.  Although this process has important                      biological consequences both for individuals and for populations,               and the details of its mechanism has been under intense study in                a number of laboratories for years, we still do not have a good                 understanding of how this process helps living organisms survive.               During his previous investigations into the mechanism of                        recombination in yeast, the author of this proposal discovered                  anew gene involved in this process; this gene encoded an enzyme                 of a type not previously seen in yeast or higher organisms.                     Mutants defective in this gene also had defects in many aspects                 of their life cycle.  This is a proposal to investigate how this                gene is involved with these other life processes.",
