 "awd_abstract_narration": "An excimer-dye laser, with frequency doubling, and a transient                  digitizer for fluorescence intensity measurements are                           requested, to be used for studies of chromium species                           oxidation, reduction and oxide-halide partitioning kinetics in                  the 300-1900 K temperature range.  Several unique experimental                  facilities are involved.  The principal one is a high                           temperature fast-flow reactor with laser-induced fluorescence                   monitoring of the Cr radicals.  Additionally, the metals high-                  temperature photochemistry reactors, development of which                       began under a previous NSF program, will be employed.  This                     apparatus allows a check on the flow reactor results and an                     extension of the 10-2 to 10-1 bar pressure range to 1 bar.  A                   second flow reactor with mass spectrometer detection will be                    utilized to help identify the reaction products.                                                                                                                The proposed research is needed for understanding the role of                   Cr species reactions in the formation of hazardous emissions                    in waste incineration.  Additionally, the equipment will be                     utilized on several other combustion projects.",
