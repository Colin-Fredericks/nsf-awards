 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frogs and toads recognize their close kin, and behaviorally                discriminate between close kin and non-kin.  In this study, the                 investigators will examine the ecological and evolutionary                      ramifications of kin discrimination in populations of tadpoles                  and adults of the American toad, Bufo americanus.  Kin                          recognition may enable breeding adults to avoid incest by                       choosing an unrelated partner for a mate.  Kin discrimination is                also evident in the schooling behavior of tadpoles, which show                  preferences to aggregate with their siblings.  To examine how                   these preferences are expressed both in natural and experimental                populations, the investigators will determine the genetic                       relationships among individuals by conducting analyses of DNA                   extracted from the nuclei and mitochondria using two techniques:                restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP's) and analyses                 of hypervariable nuclear sequences (DNA \"fingerprinting\").                           Frogs and toads are model organisms for studying questions                 of how and why animals recognize their kin.  The results should                 offer new insight into the ecology and evolution of kin                         recognition in vertebrates.  The results should also have                       practical ramifications.  Deleterious effects on growth and                     survivorship are often attributable to high levels of inbreeding.               As endangered populations decrease in size, inbreeding depression               can lead to extinction.  Kin-recognition mechanisms may function                to ensure optimal levels of outbreeding.  Hence, an understanding               of these mechanisms may be important for the development of                     effective plans of conservation.  Experimental analyses of the                  effects of genetic diversity on growth rates offer the promise of               leading to new theoretical insights that may ultimately improve                 harvesting yields, both in agricultural and fisheries projects.",
