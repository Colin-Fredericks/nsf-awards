 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Matt Lavin of Montana State University is beginning                    morphological and molecular studies of woody tropical legumes of                the Robinieae group, starting with field collecting in the West                 Indies to amass herbarium specimens and materials for laboratory                analyses of chloroplast DNA mutations.  Species boundaries and                  relationships are poorly known in this group, and the integration               of traditional morphological characters from herbarium studies                  with new molecular markers from restriction enzyme analyses                     promises to improve taxonomic ordering and help determine                       phylogenetic linkages among the taxa.  In turn, these systematic                insights will allow tests of various hypotheses proposed for the                geological history of the islands of the West Indies and for                    theories of plant migrations in the region.                                          Dr. Lavin is a young investigator with an impressive record                of taxonomic research on legumes from his doctoral and                          postdoctoral periods.  The techniques of restriction enzyme                     analysis of chloroplast DNA are powerful ones, uncovering                       mutational differences between species that reflect evolutionary                divergence since their most recent common ancestor.  The legumes                he is studying include some which are used for intercropping in                 cocoa and coffee plantations, whose wood is used for local                      construction and furniture, and herbage used for domestic                       animals.  Improved taxonomic knowledge of the species and their                 geographic distributions should aid in long-range management and                conservation of these natural plant resources.",
