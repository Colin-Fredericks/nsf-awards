Dr.                     Donagi's project is concerned mostly with the moduli of vector                  bundles on a curve, but he will also spend time investigating                   algebraically completely integrable systems and the Schottky                    problem.                                                                             Algebraic geometry is one of the oldest parts of modern                    mathematics, but one which has had a revolutionary flowering in                 the past quarter-century. In its origin, it treated figures that                could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                 polynomials. Nowadays the field makes use of methods not only                   from algebra, but from analysis and topology, and conversely is                 finding application in those fields as well as in physics,                      theoretical computer science, and robotics.",
