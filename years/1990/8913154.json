The Bohai basin is a large Cenozoic basin in                              eastern China with up to 10,000 predominantly                                   fluvial and lacustrine sediments.  Despite extensive                            research on the basin, the relationship between                                 tectonics and sedimentation, and the depositional                               environments remain unanswered.  The purpose of the                             proposed joint research between the RIPED and LSU                               is to address some of these questions.  The first                               phase of the proposed research would determine (1)                              tectonic origin, (2) stratigraphy of the basin fill,                            and (3) depositional systems of the basin.  The                                 second phase of the proposed research would employ                              the knowledge developed in the first phase to:  (1)                             develop criteria that may be used to differentiate                              and identify what factors (climate, tectonics,                                  sediment supply, base.level changes, etc.) controlled                           sedimentation, (2) develop techniques which would                               allow modern concepts of sequence stratigraphy to                               be applied to lacustrine rocks, and (3) test                                    existing models for rift or pull.apart basins.                                                                                                                  The major tasks of the proposed research would be                               to:  (1) construct subsidence curves in order to                                provide information on the history of tectonics,                                base.level changes, and subsidence in the basin and                             to provide a basis for interpreting lithospheric                                structures and mechanics, (2) analyze the geometry                              of faults and fold in the basin, (3) estimate the                               sense of motion along faults, (4) map the 3.D                                   geometry of depositional sequences, (5) interpret                               depositional environments, and (6) evaluate the                                 effects of tectonics, fluctuations in base level,                               climate, and other factors on sedimentation.  The                               data used to accomplish these tasks would include                               well logs, core, and seismic reflection profiles.",
