 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves exploiting the biodegradability,                         chirality, and spatial order of biopolymers for the construction                of important new materials.  The bacterial polyesters, cellulose,               and lysozyme have been selected for this work.                                                                                                                  Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate), PHBV, derived from                    bacterial fermentation is being used to obtain materials which                  have identical compositions but differ in the crystalline lattice               structure, crystalline perfection, spherulite size, and percent                 crystallinity.  Synthetic analogues of bacterial polyesters are                 being synthesized by carrying out a ring-opening polymerization                 of enantiomerically pure n-alkyl lactones.  PHBV is being blended               with other polymers to develop different morphologies.  The                     microbial degradability of these samples will then be studied                   using variable biological environments.  In this way, fundamental               relationships between polymer structure, morphology, and                        degradability will be established.                                                                                                                              Cellulose derivatives will be used to form liquid crystalline                   polymeric materials where the cholesteric pitch will be highly                  sensitive to external signals.  By synthesizing cellulose                       derivatives which have photo- and electroresponsive groups                      attached at controlled sites along the chain, relationships                     between polymer design, the aplied external signal, and the                     optical rotatory properties of the material will be established.                This concept will be extended to other chiral biopolymer based                  systems to explore the effects of chain dynamics on response                    time.                                                                                                                                                           The insertion of photo- and electroresponsive groups at selective               sites of the protein lysozyme will be used to initiate research                 into the modulation of enzyme conformation, and therefore                       activity.  The goal of this work is to explore methods which                    allow enzymes to essentially be turned on and off in response to                external signals which alter the spatial arrangements at protein                catalytic sites.  These proteins may provide novel routes for the               transmission of light and electrical signals.",
