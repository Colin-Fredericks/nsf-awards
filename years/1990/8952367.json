 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh is                  opening a computing lab which will utilize innovative techniques                of artificial intelligence, known as Intelligent Tutoring Systems               (ITS) of Discovery Worlds (DW), to strengthen undergraduate                     training in introductory economic analysis.  The ITS/DW approach                stimulates more independent thinking and helps students to develop              sharper analytical skills than previous instructional applications              of computers, but it also has more demanding hardware requirements              which limit the number of workstations which the Department can                 afford.  This award provides funds to improve the lab by outfitting             it with a more optimal number of appropriately configured                       workstations.                                                                                                                                                   The new lab will consist of 30 (in place of 15) workstations using              an Economics PC Discovery World program developed collaboratively               by the Project Director and the University's Learning Research and              Development Center.  The lab and software system will be used by                students in introductory microeconomics courses with enrollments                of approximately 3,000 undergraduates per calendar year.                                                                                                        The Pitt ITS/DW project has been the subject of numerous scholarly              articles, attracting interest because of encouraging evaluative                 results and the portability of the basic approach to other schools              with PC facilities.  The grantee will match this award with non-                Federal sources.",
