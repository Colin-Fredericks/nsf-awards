 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      William Murdoch, University of California at Santa Barbara, and                 three British ecologists:   Profs. Roger Nesbit and William                     Gurney, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, and Dr. Charles                     Godfray, Population Biology Center, Imperial College Field                      Station, Silwood Park.  In cooperation with these scientists,                   Dr. Murdoch will develop and analyze a number of related models,                describing the interaction between red scale, a pest insect on                  citrus, and its controlling parasitoid, Aphytis.                                                                                                                Examples of biological control provide the population ecologist                 with unparalleled opportunities to study the mechanism by which                 enemies (parasitoids and predators) control host or prey                        populations.  Biological control has provided the impetus for a                 broad range of parasitoid-host theory.  Surprisingly, however,                  very  few population ecologists have done field studies of real                 biological control systems.  Dr. Murdoch has collected extensive                sets of experimental field data on red scale/Aphytis interactions,              and in collaboration with British colleagues, has also developed                several stage-structured models.  The proposed collaboration                    will complete the analysis of existing versions of these models,                parameterize and carry out extensive computer investigations of                 these versions, and develop new versions in response to field                   results recently obtained by Dr. Murdoch.  The project will                     benefit from the complementary expertise of the U.S. and British                collaborators. Profs. Nisbet and Gurney are the foremost experts                on the development and analysis of the stage-structured models                  being used in this project.  Dr. Godfray is an expert on the                    strategic versions of the sex-allocation/host feeding model.",
