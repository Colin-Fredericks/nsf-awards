 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research program proposed here is based on the                         identification of a stable reference frame for measurement, and                 its utilization in the construction of a calibrated eustatic sea                level curve for mid-Jurassic through mid-Tertiary.  A stable                    frame is found in the Russian Platform on which flat-lying                      Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine sediments have remained undeformed                 since deposition.  The elevation of these deposits is a measure                 of post-depositional sea level change, since factors such as                    compaction and loading are very small due to the thin nature of                 the deposits.  As such, the Russian Platform acts as a meter                    stick, recording sea level through time.                                             A sea level curve based on reliable tie points will be                     constructed and compared to sea level curves obtained by other                  means. Discrepancies will be reconciled in terms of measurement                 methods and mobile reference frames.  In obtaining independent                  information regarding past sea levels, the results of this study                will shed light on the passive margin processes of thermal                      subsidence and sedimentation, as well as the motions of active                  margins.  As it stands now, sequence stratigraphic data must be                 used to infer thermal subsidence and sedimentation history, as                  well as sea level changes.  A significant result of the proposed                research project is that it will introduce another data set, so                 that the sea level signal can be filtered out, and sequence                     stratigraphic data can be used to measure thermal subsidence and                sedimentation history directly.  Research bears on issues of                    global sea level change.",
