 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will study the problem of                                           integrity in linear, time-invariant, multi-                                     input, multi-output feedback systems.  We                                       consider the closed-loop stability of the                                       unity-feedback system under three classes of                                    sensor or actuator failures.  In the first                                      class any arbitrary number of loops, including                                  all, may fail; in the second class any number                                   of loops, except all, may fail; in the third                                    class, any loop but only one loop may fail.                                     We analyze the stability of the unity-feedback                                  system with failures in each of the three                                       classes.  For the first class of failures, the                                  plant and the compensator have to be stable                                     from the start since the failure of all loops                                   will reduce the configuration to a cascade                                      connection.                                                                     For a given multi-input multi-output plant                                      which has no unstable hidden modes it is                                        possible to parametrize the class of all                                        compensators that stabilize the closed-loop                                     system.  Our goal is to parametrize the class                                   of compensators that achieve integrity for                                      each of the three classes of failures.  As                                      expected, such parametrization is possible                                      only for certain classes of plants.  The                                        objectives are to identify those plants for                                     which simultaneous stabilization of the                                         nominal plant with each failure can be                                          achieved, to find a systematic method to                                        synthesize compensators that achieve this                                       simultaneous stabilization, and to find the                                     class of all achievable closed-loop transfer                                    functions.  This will indicate which                                            performance objectives can be achieved                                          together with integrity.  Based on the                                          parametrization of all compensators that the                                    results will also be used in synthesis of                                       compensators for systems with partial loop                                      failures where constant gain factors are                                        introduced in the feedback-loops and extended                                   to an algebraic synthesis method for the case                                   of structured dynamics being introduced in the                                  loops.",
