 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to develop microbiosensors that can                          measure biochemical substances at the cellular level.                           Substances whose activity is to be measured include                             ascorbic acid, free fatty acids, free radicals and                              superoxide dismutase.  The sensor is based on the PI's                          previously developed miniature oxygen, hydrogen peroxide,                       and pH electrodes.  The tip of the micropipette                                 containing the electrodes will be covered with a                                membrane; the micropipette will be filled with                                  appropriate commercial enzymes that are selected on the                         basis of the substance to be measured.  Since oxygen-                           derived free radicals are known to damage vital tissues,                        sensors to measure substances associated with free                              radical activity could substantially contribute to the                          gaining of basic knowledge aimed at preventing and                              treating oxygen-related injury.",
