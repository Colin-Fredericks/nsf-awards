 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes the performance of discrete-time                     queueing systems, appearing in packet communication networks,                   under dependent and/or slow (or fast) packet arrival processes.                      Packet processes in today's networking structures are                      usually dependent and they may deliver packets which are at least               tau time units apart (slow lines) or they may deliver multiple                  packets almost simultaneously (fast lines).  Such processes will                be described by an m-state tau-idle Markov Modulated r-Bernoulli                model (m/tau/MM/r/B).                                                                The appropriateness of the m/tau/MM/r/B modeling for complex               packet processes is being established and (a) statistical                       multiplexers and (b) token ring networks, under m/tau/MM/r/B                    packet arrival processes, are being studied.  The analysis                      approach is based on the formulation of appropriate discrete-time               queueing models.  The buffer occupancy process, for system (a),                 and the cycle time process for system (b), are described.  Based                on these processes, packet delay results are obtained.                                                                                                               The following is being achieved:                                                -    A powerful class of models for complex packet                                   processes, which has the potential of leading to                                analytically tractable system modeling, will be                                 introduced and its superiority to previously adopted                            models will be established.                                                -    Important systems appearing in complex networking                               structures will be analyzed under certain models from                           the proposed class of models.                                              -    Techniques for the anlysis of queueing systems under                            m/tau/MM/r/B modeling will be developed.",
