 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Carnegie-Rochester Conference on Public Policy is designed to               foster research and discussion of major policy issues by                        economists from academia and policy making institutions.                        Economists in universities are often unfamiliar with the                        constraining effect of institutional arrangements in the shaping                of policy issues and policies.  Economists in government are                    often less aware of current research and its implications.  A                   central purpose of the conference is to facilitate the                          interaction between these groups in order to improve the economic               analysis of policy issues and policy.  The specific aims of the                 conference are to: 1) develop the implications of recent research               for policy; 2) bring together economists with different                         approaches or conclusions to narrow the differences; and 3) to                  uncover the analysis used by institutions that set policies.  The               conferences are held semi-annually at the University of Rochester               and Carnegie-Mellon University.  About 45 participants plus                     faculty and graduate students from the host institution are                     invited to each conference.  Participants from U.S. and foreign                 central banks and U.S. and international agencies attend                        regularly.  Special care is taken to involve promising younger                  scholars.  The papers and formal discussions are edited and                     prepared for publication to broaden the impact of the conference.                                                                                               Support should be renewed for this successful and influential                   conference series.  The conference series stimulates research by                providing a regular forum for policy and methodological debates,                identifying and commissioning papers from the leading figures in                these debates, and publishing the results of the conference in a                timely fashion.  Some of the most influential papers in modern                  macroeconomics were written for Carnegie-Rochester conferences.                 Carnegie-Rochester retains its vitality and its effectiveness.                  The quality of the most recent papers from this conference series               has been exceptionally high.",
