 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nitrate assimilation is the predominant pathway within the                      biosphere for acquisition  of inorganic nitrogen.  In the lower                 eukaryotic Neurospora crassa, nitrate assimilation is an                        inducible metabolic pathway consisting of two enzymes, nitrate                  reductase and nitrite reductase.  Biochemical studies reveal that               the expression of both enzymes is induced by nitrate, and both                  are repressed by the end product, ammonium, of primary products                 of ammonium assimilation such as glutamine.  This latter effect,                termed nitrogen metabolite repression, is dominant in that                      nitrate assimilation is essentially precluded by ammonium.  To                  date, nine genes are implicated in nitrate assimilation.  Two of                them, nit-3 and nit-6, are coordinately controlled, unlinked                    structural genes encoding the enzymes, nitrate reductase and                    nitrite reductase, respectively.  Four genes, nit-1,7, 8 and 9,                 function in producing the molybdenum cofactor essential to                      nitrate reductase.  Three genes serve regulatory  roles: nit-4 is               required for nitrate induction of the nitrate  assimilatory                     pathway, whereas nit-2 and nmr-1 have pleiotropic effects                       controlling many secondary pathways of nitrogen acquisition, e.g.               amino acid oxidation or purine catabolism, which like nitrate                   assimilation, provide for nitrogen nutrition in the absence of                  available ammonium.  Genes nit-2,3 and 4, as well nmr-1, have                   been cloned.  This research undertakes cloning and analysis of                  nit-6, the nitrite reductase structural gene, and comparison of                 its sequence organization to nit-3, its coordinately regulated                  partner.  Further, a molecular strategy has revealed additional                 nitrate regulated genes for genetic and biochemical                             characterization.",
