 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an investigation of heat transfer processes in                  very small channels with the goal of developing highly                          compact, high performance heat exchangers (heat transfer rates                  on the order of 105W/m2K, are feasible).  Microfabrication                      techniques developed in the micro-electronic industry permit                    the fabrication of small size, high precision channels in                       silicon or other suitable materials.  The proposed dimensions                   of the channels will range from a few microns to fractions of                   a millimeter in width and depth.  The proposed lengths of the                   channel will be restricted to approximately 1-2 centimeters in                  the initial stages of the study.  Large numbers of channels                     can be accommodated in extremely small volumes.  Planar                         photolithographic technology provides a method for fabricating                                                                                                  extremely complicated fins and extended surfaces suited to                      optimizing the heat transfer process.  The proposed heat                        exchangers should be able to provide efficient heat                             transmission between two fluids or from a single fluid to the                   ambient.  Other advantages of the proposed heat exchangers,                     aside from efficiency, are their very small mass, low                           inventory of working liquids, small supporting structures, low                  cost, and vibration-free character.  This type of heat                          exchanger represents a class of thermal elements that have not                  been previously studied in the dimensional regime being                         considered here, suggesting that a fundamental inquiry into                     heat exchange in this mesoscale regime is desirable from a                      purely scientific viewpoint.  The proposed research is                          interdisciplinary in nature as it addresses simultaneously                      heat transfer, materials, sensor elements for monitoring the                    heat transfer processes, and microfabrication issues.",
