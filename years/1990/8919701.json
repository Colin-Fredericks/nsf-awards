Not only has                the direction of government switched from leftward to rightward                 in two of them (English and Yiddish), but the frequency of                      deviations from strict head final order has varied substantially                over time.  In this research, we intend to investigate this                     variation and change by undertaking a detailed comparison of                    English, German and Yiddish.  We will use a two-pronged approach:               (1) we will attempt to clarify the grammatical character of the                 variation by comparative structural analysis, and (2) we will                   apply quantitative methods to specify the factors governing the                 variation and to trace the time course of secular trends in that                variation.                                                                                                                                                           The proposed research will contribute considerably to our                  knowledge of the history of West Germanic.  In addition, a                      comparison of our findings with those of a similar ongoing                      project for the history of the Scandinavian languages undertaken                by Platzack and his associates will be of interest to historical                syntacticians.  Finally, while the focus of our research concerns               the course and nature of syntactic change, our results will help                to clarify some unresolved problems in the synchronic grammatical               analysis of West Germanic.",
