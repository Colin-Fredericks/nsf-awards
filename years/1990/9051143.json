 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wellesley College is developing an intermediate level undergraduate             course on the interpretation and analysis of archaeological data with a         special emphasis on computer graphics processing of visual records of           archaeological data. Students are introduced to applications such as            the computer generation of maps and line drawings of material culture           remains from video images. Students learn how archaeologists present            and manipulate visual depictions of the archaeological record in order          to reconstruct the past and how to present one's works to an                    archaeological audience. The school is purchasing a MacIntosh IIx               computer, video camera, color videographics board, software, and                peripherial equipment which allow for the prcessing of visual images            that will form the basis of student projects in the course. The course          functions to channel interested students into already available                 advanced archaeological seminars, and is intended to increase the               number of students pursuing graduate study in anthropological                   archaeology. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
