 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic history and current structure of any population                can be represented in terms of its genealogy.  Genealogical                     analysis has become an increasingly important component of                      studies of mating behavior and genetic dispersal in natural                     populations and in the management of captive animal reproductive                performance of different genotypes, in examining the impact of                  parental imprinting on foraging behavior, or in measuring the                   effects of interactions among relatives on the inclusive fitness                of individuals.  Most such efforts to date have maternal descent                through chloroplast and mitochondria genomes, an approach that                  ignores paternal descent, a substantial part of the overall                     pedigree.  The investigators have developed an alternative                      approach that uses nuclear markers to make statistical inferences               about both maternal and paternal lineages.  Their strategy is to                employ enough genetic markers to exclude all but one make from                  consideration for each offspring.                                                    Previous work has shown, however, that a very large number                 of polymorphic markers is required to assign paternity                          categorically for each and every offspring.  A strictly                         exclusionary solution to the problem of parentage assessment is                 not attainable in many interesting applications.  The objective                 is to develop statistical/genetic estimation procedures and then                to use them to analyze male reproductive contributions for                      Chamaelirium luteum and Silene alba.  More interesting than the                 parentage spectrum are the phenotypic, genotypic, and ecological                determinants of reproductive contributions.  The investigators                  will develop statistical methods to elucidate such factors.",
