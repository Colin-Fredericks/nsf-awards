 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists                in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar on the internal structure,                        dynamical behavior, formation, and evolution of neutron stars.                  Emphasis will be placed on theoretical work on these topics                     which is relevant to understanding X-ray, optical, and pulsar-                  timing observations, including the superfluidity and equation                   of state of hadron matter, the role of neutrinos and hot                        equations of state in neutron star formation and earliest                       evolution, theories relating to the recent supernova in our                     galaxy (SN1987A), and mechanisms of cooling and heating                         neutron stars.  Participants in the meeting represent major                     U.S. and Japanese research groups concerned with the fundamental                physics and astrophysics of neutron stars.  Seminar co-                         organizers are Dr. David Pines, Department of Physics and                       Center for Advanced Study, University of Illinois at Urbana-                    Champaign, and Dr. Ryozo Tamagaki, Department of Physics,                       Kyoto University, Japan.  The seminar will take place November                  6-10, 1990, in Kyoto, under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan                      Cooperative Science Program.                                                                                                                                    Since the discovery of pulsars and galactic X-ray sources,                      significant progress has been achieved in the field of neutron                  star physics.  The discovery of Supernova 1987A in our galaxy                   stimulated much observational and theoretical work in this                      area, both in the U.S. and Japan.  Though various meetings                      have been held to consider recent observational results,                        there has been much less opportunity for U.S. and Japanese                      neutron star theorists to meet and discuss their work relevant                  to understanding the observations.  This seminar is intended                    to enhance significantly the interaction and exchange of                        knowledge among the currently most active experts of both                       countries in this field.",
