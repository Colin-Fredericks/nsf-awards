 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the                     University of Hawaii will acquire several items of                              oceanographic instrumentation to be placed in a pool of                         shared use equipment.  This equipment is maintained for use                     on or in association with the research vessel MOANA WAVE that                   the institution operates.  A substantial part of the ship's                     operating schedule during 1990 is in support of NSF-sponsored                   research projects.  The instrumentation will also increase                      the capabilities of the ship and of the institution to                          support research and engineering activities.  The                               instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                                       -An air-sea interaction sensors system.  A transportable                         instrument package will be assembled to make underway,                          continuous measurements of air temperature and humidity,                        wind velocity and wind stress, incoming solar and long-wave                     radiation, precipitation rate, and sea temperature and                          salinity,                                                                      -High-speed streamer for improving the data collection                           capabilities of a multi-channel acoustic profiling system,                     -16-channel asynchronous line multiplexer for increasing                         shared-use, sea-going computing capabilities and real-time                      acquisition and display of large data sets,                                    -A precision salinometer for determining the salinity of                         seawater samples,                                                              -Autoanalyzer for making precision measurements of several                       chemical parameters simultaneously, and                                        -an event timing controller that will provide a precision                        time standard for marking incoming data sets and for                            coordinating the sequence of events in seismic profiling.                                                                                                      The University of Hawaii is providing considerable cost                         sharing for acquiring this equipment.  The instrumentation                      described above will increase the capability of the                             Institution to support NSF-sponsored research and engineering                   projects.",
