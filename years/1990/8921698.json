 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the proposed research, the dynamics of buckle propagation and                arrest in submarine pipelines will be investigated using a                      combination of numerical, experimental, and analytical                          approaches.  The objectives of the research include the                         advancement of the understanding of the buckle propagation and                  arrest phenomena, and the development of relatively simple models               which could be used in practice to design safe and efficient                    pipeline systems.                                                                                                                                               The research will consist of three main tasks.  In Task 1,                      pipeline buckle propagation and arrest will be studied by means                 of a three-dimensional, highly accurate finite element model                    which will account for the energies dissipated by both                          circumferential deformations and longitudinal bending and                       shearing deformations.  Task 2 will involve the experimental                    testing of representative pipeline-arrestor systems under dynamic               conditions.  Finally, Task 3 will deal with the development of                  simplifies models which will represent with acceptable accuracy                 the effects and relative importance of the major factors that                   influence the buckle propagation and arrest phenomena.                                                                                                          These simplifies models are primarily intended for practical                    design purposes.   This research will provide results that will                 lead to the development of more economical and efficient designs                of offshore pipeline systems, thus enhancing the availability of                a stable energy source.",
