However, a good many natural languages do have such means, almost               always as morphology associated with the verbal system (such as                 an affix on the main verb, or an auxilliary).  But very little is               presently known about how generics are expressed, and especially                about the territory of meaning that overt generic marking                       encompasses.  In part, this is because linguists do not have a                  standard methodology for classifying generics; but more                         importantly, no extensive investigations limited to the                         phenomenon of genericity itself have been undertaken.  It is the                purpose of this project to investigate in detail the ways                       genericity is expressed in natural language, and the possible                   range of meanings that may be so expressed through examination of               grammars, use of questionnaires, and direct work with speakers of               relevant languages.  The most immediate consequence of this                     research is to provide a linguistic basis for a comprehensive                   theory of generics, with direct implications for theories of the                relationship between semantics and morphology.",
