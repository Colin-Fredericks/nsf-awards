 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physics department at Whittier College is creating a versatile              computer laboratory with 10 Macintosh SE's and assorted hardware and            software.  This laboratory will be the foundation for the newly re-             established physics major on campus.  The laboratory will be used               immediately in the introductory calculus-based and algebra-based                physics courses.  The curriculum and laboratories in the calculus-              based course are being redesigned to take advantage of the                      pedagogical benefits of computer technology.  Students will be                  allowed to explore lecture material on computers during the same                class session the material is introduced in lecture.  Because of the            laboratory's versatility, much of its equipment will continue to                serve the students as they progress through their undergraduate                 careers.  Project personnel will actively disseminate their                     experience establishing the computer laboratory and re-establishing             the physics major.  The college is matching the award with an equal             amount of funds.",
