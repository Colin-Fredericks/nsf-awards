 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide interacts with liver                     nonparenchymal cells producing an intercellular chemical                        mediator(s) which can interact with liver parenchymal cells                     increasing their fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (Fru 2,6-P2)                         concentration and phosphofructokinase activity is strongly                      supported by preliminary data and published investigations.  The                presence of these intercellular chemical mediator(s) is being                   established by determining whether addition of lipopolysaccharide               to isolated rat liver Kupffer cells (macrophages) produces a                    factor(s) in the medium that mediates Fru 2,6-P2 concentration                  and phosphfructokinase activity in cultures of rat liver                        parenchymal cells.  To test the possibility that the                            intercellular mediator formed by the nonparenchymal cells is a                  lipid, inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and                          arachidonate released from membrane phospholipids are being used.               The possibility that the factor secreted into the conditioned                   medium is a cytokine is also being tested by removing individual                cytokines from the conditioned medium with specific antibodies.                 The effects of specific lipids and cytokines in the conditioned                 medium on parenchymal cell responses is being confirmed by direct               testing using authentic compounds.  Intercellular mediators                     formed as a result of incubation of lipopolysaccharide with                     Kupffer cells are being identified and any unique factor(s) which               affect regulation of parenchymal cell Fru 2,6-P2 concentration                  and phosphofructokinase activity will be isolated and the                       chemical structure identified.                                                                                                                                  Liver parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) comprise over 90% of the                  liver by mass and are the site of principal metabolic functions                 associated with the liver.  The liver also contains non-                        parenchymal cells which comprise approximately 35% of the liver                 by cell number.  In response to a variety of stimuli, these non-                parenchymal cells synthesize and secrete biologically active                    lipids and peptides.  The importance of these locally released                  peptide and lipid factors as intracellular communicators which                  regulate and amplify specific physiological processes has been                  suggested for many years.  Recent studies have now implicated                   intra-organ communication between parenchymal and non-parenchymal               cells.  Evidence suggests that non-parenchymal cell mediate                     regulation of parenchymal cell carbohydrate metabolism.  This                   research examines this phenomenon with the intent of increasing                 our understanding of how liver carbohydrate metabolism (an                      essential life function) is regulated.",
