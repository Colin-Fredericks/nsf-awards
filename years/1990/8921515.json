 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. R.                   Damian Nance, Ohio University and Dr. Robin Strachan,                           Department of Geology, Oxford Polytechnic Institute, Oxford,                    England.   The objective of the project is an examination and                   evaluation of the nature and extent of terrane linkages                         between the Late Precambrian Avalonian Belt of the Northern                     Appalachians and the tectonostratigraphically similar                           Cadomian Belt of Britain and France.                                                                                                                            The Avalon terrane forms a distinctive but enigmatic belt of                    rocks characterized by Late Precambrian volcanic sedimentary                    successions and co-genetic granitoid plutons, overlain by a                     Lower Paleozoic shallow-marine overstep sequence bearing                        Atlantic-realm fauna.  The presence of this fauna links the                     Avalon terrane to Europe rather than to North America during                    the Early Paleozoic period and has encouraged correlation                       with the Late Precambrian rocks of Britain's Midland Platform                   and the Armorican Massif of France.   Recent studies by Dr.                     Nance suggest that the Avalonian-Cadomian Belt represents a                     single tectonic system whose evolution may relate to the                        breakup of a late Precambrian supercontinent. In this joint                     project, Dr. Nance proposes to combine his expertise in                         Avalonian tectonostratigraphy with the complementary tectonic                   skills of Dr. Strachan and his colleagues of the Cadomian                       Research Group at Oxford Polytechnic Institute in order to                      undertake a detailed examination of terrane linkages within                     the Avalonian Cadomian Belt, focusing in particular on the                      nature and kinematic history of its terrane boundaries. The                     results of this survey will contribute to a greater under-                      standing of the tectonic evolution of the Avalonian-Cadomian                    Belt.",
