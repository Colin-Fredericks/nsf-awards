 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Alvin L. Kwiram is supported by a Small Grant for                     Exploratory Research from the Experimental Physical Chemistry                   Program to investigate the potential for performing zero field                  electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy.  If he succeeds,                    this new technique will offer many unique advantages over                       conventional ESR methodologies for studying structure and                       dynamics of organic free radicals.                                                                                                                              Zero field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques have                     been known for some time now.  The primary advantage over                       conventional NMR, which arises from increased sensitivity, is                   the capability of measuring small nuclear quadrupole coupling                   constants as well as very small splittings of spin half nuclei.                 Kwiram plans to employ rapid electronic switching techniques to                 implement field cycling for ESR.  Electronic switching is                       necessary rather than the mechanical methods employed in zero                   field NMR spectroscopy, because of the much shorter relaxation                  times encountered in typical ESR experiments.  If successful,                   the resulting zero field ESR should have a sensitivity                          enhancement over conventional methods of about two orders of                    magnitude.  This increased sensitivity will open up the                         possibility of a number of new experiments involving studies of                 matrix isolated species and biological molecules.",
