 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hermans proposes molecular dynamics studies to                              investigate equilibria and kinetics of conformation change of                   peptides and proteins.  Calculations will be done for systems                   which are explicitly solvated with several layers of solvent                    molecules.  (1) Conformational free energy surfaces will be                     calculated in a 4-step process:  conformation space will be                     explored by dynamics simulations in vacuo; probability                          distributions near each free energy minimum will be computed                    by free dynamics; free energy differences between                               conformations will be determined by restrained free-energy                      simulations with applied torques, and by free-energy                            simulations with molecular substitution; barriers between                       minima will be explored separately.  These results will be                      used in conjunction with different approaches (free dynamics;                   a stochastic model; transition state dynamics) in order to                      determine the rates of barrier crossings, i.e.kinetic                           parameters of conformation changes.  (2) He plans to develop                    a method for determining a priori the effect of amino acid                      replacement on the stability of folded peptide structures and                   of native, folded conformations of proteins.  This will have                    as aims both to develop techniques that consistently                            reproduce available experimentally measured free energy                         changes, and to use the details about structure and                             thermodynamics that the dynamics simulations are uniquely                       suited to provide, and thereby quantitate the differences in                    terms of underlying physical effects.  (3) He plans to study                    conformational flexibility in enzyme active sites in two                        examples: side chain flexibility in serine protease, and its                    possible relation to specificity for different substrates;                      inhibitor flexibility in dihydrofolate reductase and its                        relation to specificity for enzymes from different species.                     (4) Finally, he will attempt to distinguish alternate                           conformations of parts of protein molecules, namely, small                      surface loops and peptide groups, according to free energy,                     in order to develop a tool applicable in structure                              determinations where experimental data provide insufficient                     detail.***//",
