 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of the federal income tax system on charitable                       contributions has been the subject of considerable interest.                    Several recent changes in federal tax law have affected that                    deduction. This project outlines an econometric study of the                    effect of the federal income tax on charitable giving which                     addresses two specification issues in past work. First, the level                                                                                               of other deductions has been held constant in earlier studies,                  but will be allowed to vary here. In general, the price and                     income elasticities of such conditional demand functions are not                                                                                                the same as those that obtain when other deductions are allowed                 to be endogenous. For tax policy purposes, the elasticities from                                                                                                the unconditional demand functions are the most relevant because                                                                                                a change in the tax price for charitable giving may change the                  level of other deductions as well. Although the treatment of                    other deductions as endogenous leads to an identification                       problem, using charitable donations from non-itemizers (which was                                                                                               allowed in the early 1980s), will enable separate price                         elasticities for charitable giving and other deductions to be                                                                                                   obtained.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The second specification issue is the endogeneity of the                                                                                                        itemization decision.  This involves a model incorporating the                                                                                                  choice of other deductions as well, for the itemization decision                                                                                                is based upon the level of all deductions. This creates some                                                                                                    estimation problems - a nonconvex kink in the budget set and,                                                                                                   conditional on itemization, the tax price of the deductible goods                                                                                               depends on the sum of the expenditures on these goods. This will                                                                                                be dealt with by extending the piecewise linear budget constraint                                                                                               econometric methodology used elsewhere.
