One of the main                    objectives of this theoretical physics research will be to                      study the role played by weakly interacting particles under                     astrophysical settings in order to obtain clues to the                          properties of these particles.  The specific questions to be                    addressed are as follows:  What are the effects of such                         particles on stellar evolution, especially when they are                        produced thermally and contribute as an energy loss mechanism?                  Can one obtain any constraints on these particles from                          observational data of stellar evolution?  In additional work,                   the properties of relativistic shock waves in which electron-                   positron pairs are produced in the post-shock matter,                           astrophysical plasmas, quark matter, and positron transport                     will be studied.                                                                     The outcome of these studies is expected to elucidate the                  new interactions in particle physics and to contribute to a                     better understanding of matter under extreme conditions in                      many-body physics.  The results will have a direct bearing on                   observational astronomy at radio to X-ray and gamma-ray                         wavelengths.",
