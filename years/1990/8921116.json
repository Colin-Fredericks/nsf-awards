 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isotopic carbon analysis provides a valuable tool for                      studies of metabolic pathways and for tracing carbon                            transformations in the environment.  The PI proposes to develop                 an optical technique for the convenient measurement of carbon                   isotopic (13C/12C) ratios.  The instrument will use a linear                    photodiode array to image the spectra arising from plasm-emission               of carbon-containing molecules.  Algorithms will be applied to                  remove spectral interferences and to correct for isotopic ration                shifts due to variations in sample pressure and power coupling.                      Initial work demonstrated that an emission system could be                 used to determine the 13C/12C ratio in CO2 samples up to a                      relative precision of 2.5% which could be improved by a factor of               6.  Mathematical methods were also evaluated for data processing.                    Follow-on studies proposed in phase II will involve adapting               the emission method for determining 13C/12C ratios for CO2 eluant               from a gas chromatograph.  System refinements, including the                    design and testing of an inlet system suitable for sampling at                  atmospheric pressure, may lead to an automated sample processing                system which will be coupled to a carbon-nitrogen analyzer for                  on-line isotope ratio determinations of both 13C and 15N.                            Successful accomplishment of the objectives of phase II                    should result in the development of an inexpensive, reliable                    alternative to mass spectrometry for the determination of the                   isotopic ratios of 13C and eventually 15N, and 18O from the same                sample.  The instrument could be readily used for tracer studies,               and with further refinements may be useful for natural abundance                analyses, in both medical and environmental fields thereby making               isotopic measurements more accessible to a broader range of                     researchers.",
