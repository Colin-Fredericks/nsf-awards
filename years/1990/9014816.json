 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to perform a systematic study              of drawing-augmented hydrostatic extrusion for the production of                ultrafine wire from soft materials on an existing unit.  The                    program will include:  (A) Stability optimization of the 63,000                 pound per square inch laboratory unit for augmented hydrostatic                 extrusion of ultrafine wires; (B) Upper-bound analysis of the                   process including hydrodynamic lubrication effects; (C)                         Demonstration of unit capabilities for extruding ultrafine                      aluminum, aluminum-silicon, and gold wire and for cladding of                   ceramic super-conductor wires, including experimental studies to                determine the effects of reduction ratios, die angles, speed,                   potential lubrication/pressure media and other variables on the                 process.                                                                             The combination of both the experimental and analytical work               is fundamental to the program.  The analysis will improve the                   understanding of the process, while the experimental phase will                 demonstrate the utility of new information and improved process                 capability.  The complete program will provide a definition of the              capabilities and limitations of augmented hydrostatic extrusion for             the production of ultrafine wire.  This research will extend the                upper limits on speed and reduction through the development of the              understanding of the process.  This understanding will lead to the              development of algorithms for the control system, as well as to its             implementation.",
