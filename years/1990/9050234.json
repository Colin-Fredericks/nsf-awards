 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hansen Planetarium proposes the creation, writing, and                 production of a 50-minute star theatre program, Cosmic                          Catastrophes: A Planet At Risk?, aimed at informally educating                  over a million individuals regarding the vulnerability of our                   Earth.  The further production of four interactive exhibits is                  planned to accompany the program.  This program will be                         marketed and distributed at a nominal charge to 250 national                    planetariums, with 50 additional production packets planned for                 loan.  In this fashion, top-quality, accurate, and timely                       science education can be guaranteed to a large selection of                     audiences.                                                                                                                                                           Scientific research tells us that catastrophes of global                   and interplanetary proportions have happened in the past, there                 is evidence that they could occur in the present, and they pose                 an imminent danger in the future.  The utilization of expert                    consultants, in conjunction with Hansen Planetarium staff, will                 insure this program presents the most current information                       available about these cosmic catastrophes.  Its interactive                     format is designed to stimulate a proactive approach to problem                 solution on the part of the audience, especially in reference                   to ecological or environmental issues.  The star show format,                   with its dynamic special effects, will make scientific theories                 surrounding cosmic catastrophes accessible and excitiong.",
