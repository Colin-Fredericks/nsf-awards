 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four-year project will broaden the mathematics content                     knowledge and pedagogical strategies of mathematics supervisors                 and middle grades teachers from nine school districts in the                    metropolitan Atlanta area. The top-down approach includes                       beginning with the instruction of mathematics supervisors, and a                small cadre of experienced mathematics teacher leaders. In a                    combination of summer and academic year inservice, the                          supervisors and project staff will work with classroom teachers.                The set of classroom teachers will be expanded each year,                       culminating during the fourth year with the involvement of                      approximately  54 teacher leaders.  The project relies on a                     constructivist model and will produce a set of written and                      videotape materials for use in other mathematics teacher                        enhancement settings. The project approach is to foster                         independence and confidence among the supervisors and teacher                   leaders, so that by the fourth year the project is moving toward                being self-sustaining.                                                                                                                                          Cost sharing is provided by Georgia State University and school                 districts as 73% of the NSF award.",
