 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community-based settlement is an important component in the                dynamics of Third World urbanization.  It consists of lower-income,             self-help housing characterized by occupant-builders who act together           in their collective best interests.  It stands in contrast to the more          common settlements of individuals who act singly in their own best              interests.  While studies of individualistic settlement of independent          family units abound, no empirical studies have been conducted on                community-based settlements.  This doctoral dissertation research is a          field-based study that will compare two individualistic and two                 community-based settlements in Mexico City and Ciudad Juarez in order           to explore differences in occupant-builders' design motives, the                resultant housing designs, and subsequent levels of housing                     consolidation.  Data for the study will be collected by means of                participant observation, selected informant interviewing, heuristic             elicitation \"games,\" and research evaluation of buildings.                                                                                                           This research will provide valuable information for urban                  geographers, planners and developers, and architects about the                  expression of the social dynamics of self-help housing in the                   development of urban landscapes.  It will contribute to our knowledge           about the provision of adequate housing for thousands of families who           are moving from rural areas to rapidly growing cities in developing             countries throughout the world.  The project also will provide an               excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
