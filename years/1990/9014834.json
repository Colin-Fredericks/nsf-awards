 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a series of experiments during the summer of 1989 using laser                interferometry to study auditory transduction and motion, the PIs               observed that a small amount of light back-reflected into a He-Ne               gas laser cavity by a moving object produced a large and                        predictable of the laser's output intensity.  In company with                   many other laser experimentalist, the PIs at first deemed this                  observation as a chaotic nuisance effect to be avoided; further                 investigation showed that this effect can provide an extremely                  valuable alternative to complex, high-precision Michelson or                    MachZehnder or other types of interferometry.  This new method,                 using only an inexpensive gas laser and the target, is                          particularly useful for the measurement of motions and                          displacements from microns down to picometers.                                                                                                                  The effect, named LAMDA (Laser Amplified Motion Detection and                   Analysis), is linear for changes in target position of less than                 8 of the laser light wavelength and has been observed easily for               motion as small as ~ 10  picometers.  LAMDA requires only a small               amount (106 - 0.1%) of back reflected light; this is easily                     obtained with diffuse scattering surfaces or from small changes                 of refractive index at dielectric boundaries.  Although observed                in the PI's laboratory with He-Ne lasers, the effect should be                  present for all continuous wave lasers including diode lasers.                                                                                                  Being able to measure motion and displacement down to the                       picometer scale with the simplest of experimental arrangements,                 an inexpensive laser and the surface to be measured, opens a                    whole new range of motion and vibration analysis, imaging,                      optical metrology, and optical data-storage possibilities.   1 It               is anticipated that LAMDA, when thoroughly understood and                       applied, will have an effect on many fields of scientific                       research and technology.  For the past several months we have                   begun to characterize in detail the mechanism and provide a firm                theoretical basis for this LAMDA effect.   2 To date, one of the                most interesting applications of LAMDA that we have found so far                is the possibility of using LAMDA's high z-resolution                           (picometers) as the basis for a light microscope having the                     ability to resolve finer detail than possible with normal                       Frauenhofer-diffraction limited microscope objectives (~200-                    400nm).  By utilizing the LAMDA effect in a scanning confocal                   microscope design, we hope to observe features of biological                    samples to a resolution of 10nm.",
