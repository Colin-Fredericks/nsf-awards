 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of glass fining involves the formation of bubbles,                                                                                                  which are mostly generated by chemical reactions within the                     raw material, and grains, which are dislodged by the glass                      currents from the \"batch blanket\" i.e. from the slab of raw                     materials fed into the furnace.  Occurrence of these                            imperfections in the final glass product depends upon glass                     circulation, temperature, gas chemistry and concentration,                      electric power density and location of air bubblers.  Because                                                                                                   of the complexity of the physical and chemical processes                        involved in glass manufacture, glass production has remained                    in part an art.                                                                                                                                                 This study is an attempt to develop a quantitative model of                     physical, chemical and transport processes in glass melting                     tanks.  In the model, the number, distribution and size of                      both bubble and grains will be allowed to grow and/or shrink                    according to glass circulation, temperature, electric power                     density, location or air bubblers and dissolved gas                             concentration patterns within the glass melt.  The model                        should provide a quantitative method of predicting the quality                                                                                                  of glass, thereby leading to improvements in furnace design                     and reduction in glass defects.",
