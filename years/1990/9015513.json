The principal investigator for the                U.S. is Leon Lederman of Fermilab and his counterpart is Gil da                 Costa Marques, President of the Brazilian Physical Society,                     President of the Federation and a professor at the University of                Sao Paulo.  Members of the Federation include Argentina, Bolivia,               Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador, Honduras,                   Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.  The first meeting will be in July,                 1990 with major meetings every year and those in each third year                expanded into a Pan American Symposium.                                                                                                                         The U.S. has extensive connections and collaborations in physics                throughout Latin America.  It is clearly in our interest to                     encourage activities which will strengthen the infrastructure of                science in developing countries as well as our bilateral agreement              partners.  This Federation will improve the level of interaction                in physics among the members and with the American Physical                     Society.  The improvement will enhance communications and the                   sharing of facilities as well as scientific ideas and the study of              physics.",
