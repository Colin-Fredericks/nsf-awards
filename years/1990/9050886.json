 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to support microcomputer-based                        instrumentation to modernize the introductory human physiology                  laboratory program at San Diego State University.  The specific                 equipment includes microcomputer stations equipped with general                 purpose analog input/output laboratory interfaces and appropriate               commercial software for data acquisition and reduction.  The                    equipment will be used for acquisition and display of data in on-               line experiments, for interactive graphics simulations of processes             which are difficult or impossible to implement in the laboratory,               for reduction and analysis of data previously acquired or provided              by the instructor, and for software tutorials and instructional                 supplements dealing with the laboratory experiments and related                 lecture materials.  This project provides several enhancements to               the conventional introductory physiology laboratory experience:                 (1) student focus can be shifted away from monitoring the recording             equipment and analyzing manually plotted data, toward a greater                 understanding of the physiological process under investigation, by              utilizing  modern data acquisition and reduction methods; (2)                   interactive animated color graphics simulations offer a self-paced,             interactive alternative to conventional laboratory courses, or the              need for use of live animals and potentially dangerous reagents;                and (3) student comprehension of concepts and principles difficult              or impossible to observe directly at the laboratory bench can be                enhanced.",
