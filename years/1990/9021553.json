 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mississippi public universities, recognizing that                               minorities are severely underrepresented in science and                         engineering degree programs at all levels in Mississippi,                       the South and the nation, have and are continuing to                            develop programs to increase minority participation.                            Responding to the National Science Foundation (NSF)                             Alliance for Minority Participation(AMP) initiative,                            Mississippi's eight state institutions of higher learning                       are proposing a state-wide comprehensive alliance and                           partnerships with other public and private educational                          institutions (public schools, junior and/or community                           colleges, and private colleges and universities), business                      and industry for the purpose of establishing cooperative                        efforts to increase the number of minority students in                          science and engineering programs at all levels but                              initially focusing at the undergraduate level.  This                            support will allow Mississippi's institutions of higher                         learning establish a Mississippi Alliance for Science and                       Engineering (MASE) center that will focus on:  (1)                              developing a Mississippi Alliance for Talent Enrichment                         (MATE) program which will be a structured partnership                           between secondary schools and colleges; and (2) developing                      a Combination of Institutions - Star Search Scholars (CIS)                      program.  The MASE Center will place emphasis on several                        of the critical bridge points in the educational pipeline.                      However, the primary focus will be towards increasing the                       undergraduate science and engineering minority enrollment                       population and strengthening the bridge between                                 undergraduate and graduate minority science and                                 engineering students enrollment trends.  The long-range                         impact of the MASE Center will be (1) to increase the                           science and engineering awareness of minority students,                         (2) to increase undergraduate minority participation in                         science and engineering programs, and (3) to increase the                       number of graduate degrees granted to minorities in                             science and engineering programs.  Over the initial                             five-year period the MASE Center will monitor progress in                       each to establish an on-going statewide process to ensure                       a long-term commitment to increasing minority                                   participation in science and engineering programs.  During                      NSF-AMP funding for the Mase Center, minority                                   participation in the sciences and engineering should                            increase to reflect their percentage of the population in                       the State.  Mississippi's population is approximately 37%                       African American.",
