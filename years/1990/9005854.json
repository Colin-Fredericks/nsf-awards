 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Society on Oxygen Transport to Tissue                         (ISOTT) is dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge                                concerning metabolism and anabolite and metabolite                              transport in tissue.  ISOTT emphasizes a dual scientific                        and engineering approach, utilizing interdisciplinary,                          theoretical, and experimental methodology to unravel the                        secrets of tissue maintenance, repair, growth, and                              replacement.  The Society was established to involve                            international scientists and engineers in the development                       and application of forefront techniques to allow a more                         basic understanding of the important physical/chemical/                         biochemical phenomena that are necessary for normal tissue                      functioning.  The Society has made contributions in                             advancing the gross analysis techniques of the past to the                      synergistic studies of tissue micro areas by the                                sophisticated mathematical and experimental means of                            today.  Efforts have been directed towards the acquisition                      of knowledge at the regional tissue level, both in vitro                        and in vivo, and are now moving rapidly to the examination                      of fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular                            level.  This work necessitates the use of today's most                          powerful computing machinery and the use of state-of-the                        art experimental methodology, such as polarographic, auto                       radiographic, cytometric, and nuclear magnetic resonance                        techniques.                                                                                                                                                     ISOTT's mission is to enhance the understanding of                              mechanisms that lead to tissue pathology, to overcome                           pathologic trends, and to repair and replace                                    nonfunctioning tissue.  The meeting results will be                             published as a proceedings (usually by Plenum Press in its                      Advances in Medicine and Biology series), which will be                         used as a reference throughout the world.",
