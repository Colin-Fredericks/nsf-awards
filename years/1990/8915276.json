 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of robust adaptive control is to realize                                satisfactory performance in adaptive systems when                               various classes of perturbations are present.  Examples of                      such perturbations include bounded disturbances, time-                          variations in plant parameters, and unmodeled dynamics                          in the plant.  While the behavior of adaptive systems in                        the presence of bounded disturbances is currently well                          understood and powerful results have been derived,                              robustness in the presence of parameter variations and                          unmodeled dynamics has been established only under                              assumptions that are quite restrictive.  The proposal                           addresses robustness in the presence of the latter two                          perturbations and is aimed not only at relaxing these                           assumptions but also at developing a general set of                             conditions under which the adaptive system exhibits                             satisfactory behavior.  In the discussion of each problem,                      the current status of research is first stated, followed by                     the approach that is proposed and the adaptive                                  procedure that will be employed.  In each case, a global                        analysis of the underlying nonlinear system will be carried                     out and attempts will be made to derive sufficient                              conditions for global boundedness of solutions as well as                       conditions under which the system can have unbounded                            solutions.  The aim of the research is to develop better                        methods for the design of practical adaptive controllers                        which can meet stringent performance requirements.",
