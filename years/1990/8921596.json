 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precipitation is an important factor in the dynamics of                    clouds.  For example, evaporation of raindrops below cloud base                 cools the surrounding air and influences cloud development.                     Since the rate of water evaporation depends on the surface area                 of the drops, the drop size distribution plays an important role                in the cloud evolution.                                                              In order to model the dynamics of convective clouds, it thus               is necessary to include a realistic formulation of the raindrop                 size distribution.  Such models must take account of the                        interaction between the small-scale microphysical process (such                 as water drop evaporation) and the larger-scale microphysical                   processes (such as air motion).  Since the two types of processes               operate on significantly different time and space scales, it is                 not feasible from a computational standpoint to include in the                  models detailed solution of the microphysical equations.                        Instead, such models must rely on the use of simple formulas to                 approximate the evolution of the raindrop distribution.                              Professor Brown's object in this research is twofold: to                   obtain a better knowledge of the relevant microphysical processes               through analysis of model equations and observational data; and                 from this knowledge to develop simple parameterization formulas                 describing the evolving raindrop size distribution for use in                   convective cloud models.  The analysis and parameterization are                 to take account of the microphysical processes of drop                          coalescence, breakup and evaporation.//",
