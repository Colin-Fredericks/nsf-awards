 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to carry out a study of modal phase                      proportions, crystal size distribution, and major and trace                     element compositions of mid-ocean ridge basalts and spatially                   associated gabbros from the Juan Ridge (10-12 N), and the Mid-                  Atlantic Ridge (45 N, 36 N, and 23-26 N), and Mid-Cayman RIse and               Southwest Indian Ridge.  This is a baseline study not before                    attempted on a regional scale.  The objectives are to relate                    model proportions, crystal size distributions, major and trace                  element compositions to spreading rate, ridge segmentation,                     cooling history, and other factors.                                             %%%                                                                                  This work represents a major effort to relate petrographic                 signature as seen in modal phase proportions, crystal size, etc.                to petrological processes on a regional scale at ocean ridge                    crests.  This is a time consuming, basic effort in petrology of                 first order importance.  Dr. Bryan has been a leader in the study               of ocean floor basalts for many years.  Dr. Meyer is a young                    associate who is very adapt at applying modern techniques to                    petrologic problems.  This work should lead to important knew                   knowledge regarding magmatic processes at ocean ridge crests.",
