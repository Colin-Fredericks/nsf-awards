 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in                  annual samples of banded corals from several sites in the                       Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  The goals are to establish the                    vriability of the ventilation of the main thermocline with                      respect to CO2 and to determine the cause and spatial extent of                 decade time scale changes in surface ocean     1 4 C during the                 past 500 years.  First, high precision (+2 /  )  1 4 C records                  will be reconstructed for the post-bomb period (1953-present)                   for banded corals from the equatorial and South Atlantic.                       Isopycnal mixing models for the upper ocean, similar to that                    used previously, will be constructed for these locations and                    for the North and South Pacific.  Second, high precision  1 4 C                 records will be reconstructed for the Little Ice Age (A.D.                      1400-1850) from four sites in the world's ocean - North                         Atlantic (Florida), North Central Pacific (Hawaii), eastern                     equat Pacific (Galapagos) and Southwest Pacific (Great Barrier                  Reef).  It will be determined whether the decade time scale                     changes noticed in surface ocean   1 4 C during the Maunder                     minimum in the Southwest Pacific (Abrahams Reef) were an ocean-                 wide  phenomena, and the potential impact of these changes on                   surface circulation and on the cycling of CO2 will be assessed.                 Third, the Suess effect and the changes in  1 8 O and  1 3 C in                 banded corals from the North Central and Southwestern Pacific                   will be measured in order to assess the input of fossil fuel                    CO2 into the ocean.  Fourth, high precision  1 4 C will be                      measured on fossil corals that have been accurately dating                      using 230 Th by mass spectrometry from the raised reefs of the                  Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea.  The goal here is to develop                  a method to extend the radiocarbon chronology past that                         available from known-aged tree rings (>9,700 calendar yrs BP),                  into the early Holocene and deglaciation periods when                           atmospheric pCO2 was substantially lower than nineteenth                        century levels.",
