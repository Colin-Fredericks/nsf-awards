 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichodesmium is a species of photosynthetic bacteria , a                       cyanobacterium, which forms large concentrations in the surface                 waters of the open ocean. It posesses the ability to fix                        atmospheric nitrogen unlike most of the other phytoplankton which               depend upon the dissolved forms  of nitrogen in seawater , eg.                  nitrate, for uptake into the cell for subsequent growth. At                     times, this species forms dense blooms which may be extremely                   important in transient rates of new production in the ocean.                    Since the discovery of nitrogen fixation in association with                    Trichodesmium, many studies have attempted to characterize the                  nitrogen fixation activity and physiology of the species.                       However, the mechanisms of nitrogen fixation are still not                      understood. The enzyme nitrogenase which catalyzes the reduction                of dinitrogen to ammonium is rapidly inactivated by oxygen.                     Therefore these organisms which live in the high oxygen zone of                 the surface waters must somehow protect their nitrogenase from                  the oxygen that they themselves generate during photosynthesis.                                                                                                 Dr. Zehr focuses his work on two major questions: 1) how does                   Trichodesmium fix nitrogen and evolve oxygen simultaneously, and                2) does Trichodesmium posess a unique or alternative nitrogenase                system that allows it to synthesize active nitrogenase in waters                depleted of micronutrients such as molybdenum. The work                         identifies unique characteristics of the nitrogenase genes in the               species using molecular techniques to construct a genomic library               to characterize the organization of the gene. Probes and                        antibodies are to be prepared to study the expression of the                    genes in natural populations and cultures.",
