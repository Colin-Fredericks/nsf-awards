 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous rock shelters or overhangs which line the base of                      Cingles del Capello, a cliff located in SE Barcelona Province,                  Spain, have been shown to contain stratified archaeological                     deposits.  These are of interest for several reasons.  First,                   they contain stratified materials which document the Neanderthal                period in Europe and which probably continue into more recent                   times.  Second, because sedimentation in this region appears to                 be rapid, clean separation between different occupations of these               rockshelters is likely.  Finally, the shelters contain layers of                travertine the age of which can be determined by Uranium series                 dating.  For these reasons Dr. Lawrence Straus will conduct a                   season of archaeological excavation at two cliff sites:  Cova                   Anton and Els Pinyons.  He will clean the face of previously                    excavated pits, remove overburden, and then conduct careful                     stratigraphic excavation to determine the nature of the cultural                materials present.  He will collect and analyze faunal and floral               materials as well as lithic remains.  In addition to travertines,               organic materials will be submitted for absolute age                            determinations.                                                                                                                                                 Anatomically modern humans first appeared in Europe approximately               35,000 to 40,000 years ago.  Before that time the human                         inhabitants were physically distinct and termed \"Neanderthals.\"                 The associated culture is called \"Mousterian.\"  It is unclear                   what happened to the Neanderthals and not known whether they                    developed relatively rapidly into modern forms or whether they                  were replaced by other peoples.  It is also unclear whether or                  not the succeeding \"Upper Paleolithic\" cultural tradition                       developed directly from the Mousterian or is intrusive from                     elsewhere.  Because sites which are both datable and which cover                this time period are so rare, it has been difficult to select                   between alternatives, and in this context El Pinyons and Cova                   Anton assume great significance.                                                                                                                                This research is important because it will shed light on the                    emergence of anatomically modern humans and associated culture in               Europe.",
