 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clemson University will conduct a four-year program based on                    implementing recommendations in the NCTM Standards for middle school and        secondary schools.  Target subject matter areas are pre-algebra,                geometry, introductory algebra, and intermediate algebra, which together        constitute the college preparatory track in the target district.                Expected outcomes include integration of graphic calculators and                computer software throughout the Pickens County School District.  The           model includes a cooperative effort among Clemson University, the               Pickens County School District, and local industry, each strongly               committed to success of the effort. The program features summer                 workshops for content and pedagogy enhancement and for adapting existing        materials to be used by teachers and students in the implementation.            The Pickens County School District and Clemson University, with the             cooperation of Texas Instruments and National Cash Register, have               contributed an amount equal to 33% of the NSF request.",
