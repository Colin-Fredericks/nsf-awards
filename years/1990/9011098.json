 "awd_abstract_narration": "Therapeutic proteins are an example of high-value                               proteins whose biosynthesis and downstream recovery has                         been limited by low productivity, extreme contamination,                        FDA requirements and difficulties due to improper                               modification or deleterious altering of the protein                             structure by the genetically engineered production system                       such as tissue culture.  These problems have led to an                          undesirable mode of treatment available to people such as                       hemophiliacs due to cost and limited availability of the                        replacement protein.  A detailed understanding of the                           structure and activity of the protein produced by the                           recombinant system facilitates the engineering of                               recovery methods for appropriate forms of the protein of                        interest as well as having genetic value for the recovery                       of other proteins using that same expression system.                                                                                                            Transgenic mice which express human Protein C that is                           biologically active have been a good model for the                              production of a therapeutic protein by using a mammal as                        a bioreactor.  Protein C is an anti-clotting protein                            which has potential for the treatment of clotting                               problems associated with septic shock, heart attack, and                        hip replacement surgery.  The distribution of Protein C                         products is being evaluated based upon proteolytic and                          biosynthetic modifications characteristic of mammary                            tissue expression.  Proteolysis seems to effect the                             integrity of the Protein C produced in murine milk.  Pig                                                                                                        milk doped with Protein C has also shown this same                              problem.  Transgenic pigs containing the same genetic                           information as successfully used in mice are being                              evaluated as a large scale bioreactor with the potential                                                                                                        of grams of heterologous protein per day.  An                                   immunoaffinity procedure for isolation of Protein C from                                                                                                        murine and pig milk is being developed.  The future use                         of transgenic animal bioreactors depends upon the                               knowledge of the biochemical changes that are affected by                                                                                                       the mammary tissue and milk environments.",
