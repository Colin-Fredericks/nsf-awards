 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to determine the effects of phasic                           composition, surface structure, and stoichiometry on the                        catalytic properties of molybdenum nitrides and carbides.  A                    series of thin films with well-defined structures anad                          stoichiometries are synthesized, evaluated for catalytic                        activity, and characterized.  Thin films are prepared with                      ion-beam-assisted deposition (IBAD), a technique that permits                   growth of compound materials with control over structure and                    stoichiometry.  Hydrodenitrogenation of pyridine,                               dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, and hydrogenolysis of                           cyclohexane are used to test for ability to activate C-N, C-H,                  or C-C bonds, respectively.  Primary characterization is done                   with Auger spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption,                     and  temperature-programmed reaction.  Other techniques                         employed include X-ray diffraction, Rutherford                                  back-scattering, and electron microscopy.                                                                                                                       The objective of this effort is to develop relationships                        between the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties                    of early transition-metal nitrides and carbides, starting with                  molybdenum.  These have potential for a variety of commercial                   processes including petroleum refining, pollution abatement,                    and conversion of gaseous resources into liquid fuels; in many                  cases, they are prospective substitutes for rare and expensive                  platinum-group metals.  The results of this work may also be                    applicable in tribology and electrochemistry.",
