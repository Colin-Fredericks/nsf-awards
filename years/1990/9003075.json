 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Gootman will continue his investigations                         concerning the ideal structure, representation theory, and dual                 topology of crossed product C*-algebras GxA determined by an                    action or coaction of a locally compact G on a C*-algebra A.  As                in the past, Professor Gootman will combine the three major                     methods for the study of such algebras: non-commutative duality                 theory, representation theory, and spectral methods (non-abelian                harmonic analysis).  Following such an approach, the proposer has               already made progress on similar questions in collaboration with                Professor Aldo Lazar.  Professor Gootman will attempt to                        generalize a spectral characterization of simplicity of GxA which               came out of this collaboration to general amenable G, and also                  to extend his investigations concerning the duality between                     induction and restriction of representations.  This study should                yield new information on ordinary crossed products, and in turn                 on groups, historically one of the major motivations for studying               crossed products.                                                                    The notion of a C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of                a family of linear transformations on a space.  These                           transformations can also be thought of as having values in the                  states of the space, and the property of this family which is                   responsible for the symbol * is the fact that the algebra is                    generated by transformations whose values in these states are                   real numbers.  The fact that these objects appear naturally in                  many branches of mathematics and physics makes them important to                study.",
