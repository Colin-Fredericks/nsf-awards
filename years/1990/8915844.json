 "awd_abstract_narration": "SCOPEX (South Channel Ocean Productivity Experiment) is a                       multidisciplinary program to investigate springtime aggregations                of right whales off New England and the interactions between                    these whales and their main prey, the copepod Calanus                           finmarchicus.  The underlying hypothesis is that whales are                     concentrated in this limited area each spring because of                        unusually dense concentrations of copepods.  Possible causes of                 the copepod aggegations include advection, elevated production,                 behavior, or a combination of these factors.  On cruises in                     spring 1988 and scheduled for spring 1989, measurements were made               of whale distributions and behavior (H. Winn, R. Kenney, URI),                  zooplankton distributions (K. Wishner, URI), phytoplankton                      distributions and zooplankton feeding (E.  Durbin, A. Durbin,                   URI), acoustic biomass (M. Macaulay, NMFS, B. Frost, UW),                       hydrography and currents (R. Beardsley, R. Limeburner, WHOI, P.                 Cornillon, URI).  Preliminary results from the 1988 cruise showed               that (1) whale dive times were correlated with the depth of a                   diel migrating acoustic layer, implying that the whales were                    feeding on plankton in this layer.  (2) Dense copepod layers                    could be either strongly migrating or present continuously near                 the surface, with both interannual and geographic variability.                  Whales can feed on both types of layers.   (3) No well-defined                  eddy (a possible concentrating mechanism) was associated with the               plankton aggregations.  While there was come indication of very                 slow flow at 50m and deeper, the near-surface drifters tended to                move quickly out of the area.  Further analysis of 1989 cruise                  samples will now be pursued to complete the investigation.",
