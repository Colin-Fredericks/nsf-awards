 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent work by Dr. Warner has shown, through a series of                   experimental manipulations, that the interaction of tradition and               resource assessment is a potent force in mating system                          determination in a model species, Thalassoma bifasciatum (a coral               reef fish).  Mating sites that have been in use for generations                 change to new locations only when tradition is broken by removing               and replacing the entire population.  Under normal circumstances,               site usage is constrained by tradition.  The physical attributes                of mating site may change over time, but the population has                     little opportunity to reset to any new distribution of resources                because there is an initial liability in attempting to mate at a                nontraditional site.  These results are significant because they                challenge current thinking in behavioral ecology: mating systems                may not be predictable from measurements of the current                         distribution of resources.                                                           This work leads to some predictions about the role of                      catastrophic disturbance in this mating system.  If population                  traditions are broken by a natural catastrophe, the mating                      system which is reestablished should be correlated with existing                measurable resources.  Prior to the occurrence of Hurricane Hugo,               Dr. Warner had mapped the distribution of mating sites on 19                    patch reefs in Teague Bay, St. Croix.  On five of these reefs he                had also measured the physical characteristics of these sites as                well as other sites that were suitable but were not used.  There                were many unused sites that had the same physical characteristics               as sites that were used.  If Dr. Warner's published predictions                 are correct, a new suite of mating sites will arise after the                   hurricane, and these will posses physical characteristics that                  will clearly distinguish them from other structures on the reef.                This is an unprecedented opportunity to test a hypothesis that                  referred specifically to the effects of catastrophic events on                  mating systems.",
