 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Research award supports                            cooperative research in developmental neurobiology to be                        conducted by Dr. Torsten Wiesel and Dr. David Sretavan of                       Rockefeller University and Dr. Ary Ramoa of the Federal                         University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The goal of this                          research is to understand how precise patterns of axonal                        projections, present in the mature mammalian visual system,                     are established during development. The experiments will                        focus on three areas.  First, is the nature of the cellular                     interactions between developing retinal axons and neuro-                        epithelial cells at the optic chiasm. Second, is the identity                   and spatial-temporal distribution of cell surface molecules                     present on both retinal axons and neuroepithelial cells.                        Third, is the further development and refinement of an in                       vitro culture system to study retinal ganglion cell axon                        pathfinding.  Results from this set of studies will not only                    lead to a better understanding of how a major axon pathway in                   the visual system is formed during embryonic development, but                   will also provide insight into how specific axonal projections                  may arise in other parts of the central nervous system.                                                                                                         Dr. Ramoa will bring to this project his expertise on the                       embryonic development of mammalian retinal ganglion cells and                   will also benefit by learning a powerful research technique                     which will be of direct use in his own research in Brazil.                      Dr. Ramoa's past research has focused on the development of                     mammalian retinal ganglion cells in terms of the maturation                     of their morphological features and their electrophysio-                        logical properties. While in the U.S., Dr. Ramoa will work with                 Dr. David Sretavan using hybridoma techniques to generate                       monoclonal antibodies directed against molecules present on                     developing retinal ganglion cells and the neuroepithelial                       cells of the optic chiasm.",
