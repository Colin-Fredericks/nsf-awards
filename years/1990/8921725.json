 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is widely agreed that stock market values of many large                      American corporations, particularly diversified ones, are                       substantially below their intrinsic values.  This statement                     typically means that when such companies are restructured,                      usually but not always after being taken over, substantial                      increases in stock-market values are realized.  Although there is               broad agreement that restructuring is accompanied by an increase                in shareholder wealth, there is not much evidence about why this                is necessarily so.                                                                                                                                              The purpose of this research is to analyze the determinants of                  the valuation of public corporations and the impact of hostile                  takeovers on their value.  An important goal of this analysis is                to distinguish between theories that suggest some companies are                 mismanaged from theories that suggest that corporations are under               valued relative to their fundamental viability, and do not                      require any changes in management or operating strategies.                      Unlike many previous studies that focus exclusively on takeover                 targets, this analysis will combine a study of the targets of                   hostile takeovers with a more general analysis of the valuation                 of public companies in the stock market.  This research is                      important because it will shed light on whether or not hostile                  takeovers tend to be in the public interest.",
