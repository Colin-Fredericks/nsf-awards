 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant hormone, ethylene, regulates a wide range of                          physiological and developmental processes in higher plants.  While              a significant amount of progress has recently been made in the                  elucidation of the ethylene biosynthetic pathway and in the                     molecular bases for a number of ethylene regulated processes,                   virtually nothing is known about the receptor and associated signal             transduction pathways in plants.  The goal of this proposal is the              molecular cloning and characterization of the ETR locus in                      Arabidopsis thalina.  Mutations in the ETR locus have been isolated             which cause insensitivity to a number of ethylene responses in the              plant.  Physiological evidence indicates that the mutations                     directly effect the ethylene receptor.  From a chromosome walk, an              18 kb region of cloned genomic DNA has been obtained which appears              to carry the ETR gene.  The investigators intend to identify the                specify sequences in this region that represent the ETR gene and                to obtain full length cDNA clones of the mutant and wild type                   genes.  The cDNA clones will also be used to manipulate the level               of expression of the wild type and mutant gene products in                      transgenic Arabidopsis and in a number of other plant species.                  Engineered mutations in the gene will allow an exploration of the               dominant nature of the etr phenotype.",
