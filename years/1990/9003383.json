 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research in statistical methods involves probability                  models for the rankings that result when a group of subjects each               independently ranks a set of items from first place to last                     place. These include Thurstone order statistics models, ranking                 models induced by paired comparisons and models based on                        distances between rankings. In many practical problems the                      probability of observing any particular ranking is affected by                  the values of one or more independent variables, or subject                     covariates, associated with the subjects performing the ranking.                In a different but related situation, covariates associated with                the items can be used to describe the probability distribution of               the ranking.  A principal goal of the proposed research is to                   investigate the consequences of different methods of                            incorporating the information contained in both item and subject                covariates. The performance of the methods, which allow for the                 development of formal inferential and graphical techniques for                  studying the effects of the covariates, will be evaluated. A                    semi-parametric approach will be described to detect systematic                 differences between rankings which arise in pairs, such as pre-                 and post-treatment rankings produced by the same subject.                       Residual spectral analytic techniques will be applied to ranking                models in general and covariate models in particular. Diagnostics               based on the distributional properties of the residuals will be                 developed.",
