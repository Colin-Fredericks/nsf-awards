 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to develop a project to examine the                   effect of chronic exposure to low-level concentrations of                       pesticides and their interaction with other environmental factors               on the growth, reproduction and respiration of marine and                       freshwater crustaceans.  Of particular interest would be the                    combined effect of pesticides and environmental factors such as                 temperature, salinity and pH on the common shore shrimp,                        Palaemonetes vulgaris; the freshwater flea, Daphnia pulex  and the              scud, Gammarus pseudolimnaeus.  The compounds to be investigated                include representatives of two major classes of insecticides:  the              organosphosphate malathion, and the carbamate aldicarb, as well as              the triazine herbicide atrazine.  Short term bioessays will be                  conducted to determine the minimal concentration for each                       substance that will affect the reproduction, morphology and                     respiration of the organisms.  Although short term effects will be              documented, the primary interest of the investigation is to study               the long-term effect on the organisms resulting from continuous                 exposure to low-level concentrations of pesticides in combination               with other factors.",
