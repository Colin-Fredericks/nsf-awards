 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on a transformational synthesis in which a naive               implementation of a control specification is transformed into one that          better meets the requirements of the overall design.  Two new ideas are         being explored.  One is to use a search strategy similar to that used           by production systems, but which is more efficient because in the search        rules it hides much of the detail of the underlying implementation.             This gives the flexibility and modularity of the rule-based approach            while avoiding the performance problems.  The other idea is to build            feed back into the system so that decisions about the design of the             controller can be evaluated in terms of their impact on the overall             design and refined accordingly.  Ideas generated in the research are            being experimented with in a testbed, a synthesis system that goes from         abstract specification to layout, or pseudo-layout.  Evaluation of              integrating the controller designer into a larger synthesis system is           being made.",
