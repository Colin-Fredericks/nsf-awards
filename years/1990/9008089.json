 "awd_abstract_narration": "An International Conference on the Nerve Growth Cone is planned                 for the Santiago Ramon y Cajal Neurobiology Institute in Madrid,                SPAIN from October 15-19, 1990.  The goal of the Conference is to               bring together top researchers on nerve growth cones to                         synthesize current knowledge, develop new concepts of growth cone               function, and crystalize strategies for future experimentation.                 This meeting is especially timely, because techniques and tools                 now coming available from chemistry, molecular biology,                         physiology, optics and computerized imaging technology are                      allowing significant gains in elucidation of how growth cones                   mediate the intricate construction of nervous systems.  A meeting               of scientists who use these diverse methods will generate new                   insights and collaborations.  The conference will cover the                     following topics:  internal chemistry and physiology of growth                  cone activity, external control of growth cone behavior, growth                 cone activity in developing organisms as neural circuits are                    constructed, and growth cone activity in adult organisms and                    after neural circuits are damaged.  Thus, this meeting will help                explain how the brain grows, adapts, learns, and perhaps can be                 repaired.  Twenty nine speakers have already agreed to speak at                 the meeting and also write a chapter for a published monograph.                 In addition, poster exhibits will be presented.  Neurobiological                interest in growth cone activity has grown tremendously, and this               first meeting devoted solely to growth cones will receive wide                  notice and will enhance research in the area for several years.",
