 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Czechoslovakia research                      project between Dr. Daniel Litvin of Pennsylvania State                         University and Dr. Vojtech Kopsky of the Czechoslavok Institute                 of Physics is to develop a systematic, unified theory for                       defining relationships among subperiodic subgroups of                           crystallographic space groups.  There exists a wide variety                     of nomenclature and notation for these groups, i.e., Frieze                     groups, ribbon groups or line groups in two-dimensions, and                     rod groups, linear space groups or one-dimensional (subper-                     iodic) groups in three-dimensional space.  But no complete                      standards exist for the subperiodic groups in the International                 Tables for Crystallography.  The researchers intend to set                      the standards for the orientation of axes and origins of the                    subperiodic subgroups of the space groups to replace the                        myriad of choices found in the literature.  Their efforts                       should yield a useful, standardized reference for classifying                   and characterizing subperiodic groups by their irreducible                      qualities.  Such a work should be an important contribution to                  the infrastructure of the research communities examining                        topics in condensed matter and materials science.                                                                                                               This project in condensed matter theory fulfills the program                    objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool research resources in                    areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
