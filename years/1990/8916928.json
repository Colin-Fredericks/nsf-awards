 "awd_abstract_narration": "In most insects, the peritrophic matrix is thought to play a                    major role in food digestion and absorption. The peritrophic                    matrix is an acellular sheath that lines the entire intestine and               is secreted by the cardia, an organ located at the Drosophila                   foregut/midgut junction. One aim of this proposal is to study the               function of genes that encode peritrophic matrix components.                    Another aim is to study organogenesis of the cardia during                      embryonic development. Genes that are expressed specifically in                 the adult cardia were isolated in Dr. Jacobs-Lorena's laboratory                and will be characterized to determine patterns of expression,                  DNA sequence, and gene function. To identify genes that play a                  determinative role in the genesis of the cardia, he will use a                  newly developed P-element/beta-galactosidase vector in a screen                 for genes that are expressed specifically in embryonic cardia                   precursor cells. These studies will be complemented by cell                     ablation experiments that will assess the importance of cell-cell               interactions and should define the contribution of different cell               types to the formation of the peritrophic matrix.                               %%%                                                                             In insects that transmit human diseases, the peritrophic matrix                 interacts directly with parasites and modulates their                           transmission. Understanding how the organ that secretes this                    matrix is formed and functions will have practical implications                 as well as adding to our knowledge of organogenesis.",
