 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for Juan Redondo, who is a                      postdoc at the University of Michigan working with Professor Jeff               Rauch.  Dr. Redondo plans to continue his study of the regularity               of free boundaries in the solutions of parabolic variational                    inequalities like the ones associated with the classical Stefan                 problem.  He is also going to investigate the regularity of shock               wave solutions of hyperbolic conservation laws by applying his                  variational techniques to the parabolic systems that come from                  adding viscous terms to the original hyperbolic systems.                        Nonlinear partial differential equations describe many                          dissipative phenomena like the flow of heat.  If the amount of                  dissipation is small the solutions of such equations often behave               as if there is no dissipation at all. In this grant the postdoc,                Juan Redondo, will use techniques from variational theory that                  exploit this relationship between dissipative and non-dissipative               systems in order to study things like the shape of a boundary                   between different materials and the sharpness of a front between                gases of different densities.",
