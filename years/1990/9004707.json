 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism                 by which the amino acid sequence of a protein directs the rapid                 and efficient folding to the native conformation.  The approach                 is to use site-directed mutagenesis to identify sidechains                      which play key roles in folding.  Those that have such roles                    will, when replaced, have discernable effects on the                            equilibrium and kinetic properties of folding.  The protein to                  be studied is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Escherchia                    coli.  DHFR is a relatively small monomeric protein which has                   no disulfide bonds or prosthetic groups and for which a high                    resolution X-ray structure exists.  A combination of                            absorbance, fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies                  have been used to establish a folding model for DHFR.  This                     model postulates the existence of a number of transient folding                 intermediates whose structures and energetics will be studied.                  The rate limiting steps in folding which immediately precede                    the native conformation will also be subjects for further                       investigation.  The information obtained from these studies                     will enhance the possibility of predicting the tertiary                         structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, advance                    our understanding of the molecular defects in genetically                       transmitted diseases, and improve our ability to alter enzymes                  to improve catalytic properties.",
