 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the coupling between atmospheric, ionospheric                and magnetospheric electric fields and current systems is one of                the basic goals of solar-terrestrial physics.  Many radar                       techniques are used to study the high altitude thermosphere                     electric fields and their variations.  New studies have shown the               linkage between low altitude tropospheric and stratospheric                     electric fields and currents, with variations in the                            thermosphere.  Development of techniques and acquisition of these               low altitude data have been very controversial.  This cooperative               NSF and NASA project builds upon past operational programs and                  data analyses in the design of a multi-balloon long duration ( 3                months ) flight program to measure many of the needed parameters.               The ELBBO ( Extended Life Balloon Borne Observations ) program                  plans to launch a total of ten balloons. Two prototype flights                  from Brazil and 8 others from either Brazil, New Zealand or the                 Antarctic depending somewhat on the outcome of the initial                      flights.  The basic objectives are to measure the vector electric               field, conductivity, current density, magnetic field,VLF and ULF                electric and magnetic waves, nightglow variations and                           atmospheric x-rays.  These data will then be used to test and                   improve existing models of the global electric circuit.",
