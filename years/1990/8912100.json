 "awd_abstract_narration": "Limiting factors in highly parallel computation that stem from timing,          communication, and reliability requirements are studied.  Particular            emphasis is placed on large regular structures, which are especially            well suited for signal processing and iterative scientific computation,         such as solving differential equations and simulating cellular                  automata.  Computers with a million or more processors will be needed           in some of these applications and mathematical results are needed to            guide designer's decisions on synchronization method, memory                    organization and use of redundancy.                                                                                                                             The over-riding concern is whether the cost of systems can be made to           grow slowly enough with the amount of parallelism.  Ideally, the goal           is to ensure linear speedup - a proportionate return on hardware                investment.                                                                                                                                                     In the area of timing, work continues in statistical modeling of clock          skew in synchronous systems, the analysis of throughput in self-timed           arrays, and an ongoing comparison between these two synchronization             paradigms.  In synchronous systems all processing in different                  computational elements is simultaneously triggered by a signal called           clock.  Clock skew arises when the clock signal must travel different           distances in order to reach all parts of a system.  This may cause the          system to work incorrectly.  In self-timed systems, different elements          do not assume their computations are synchronized and exchange \"hand-           shaking\" signals everytime they need to synchronize.  This may render           the system slower due to overhead.                                                                                                                              In the area of communication, work continues on bounds based on                 pebbling arguments.  These bounds on throughput depend only on memory           bandwidth, and reveal the constraining effect of that resource.  A              major problem in parallel processing with large number of processors is         to ensure that data is available for all processors to operate on.              This data must be present in the memory of the different elements               and/or be input/output to the machine.  The availability of data                ultimately determines computational speed.                                                                                                                      Analogous questions about the reliability of large parallel arrays are          addressed.  The question of whether or not linear speedup is attainable         with fixed reliability is a central problem here, and is the subject of         theoretical work.",
