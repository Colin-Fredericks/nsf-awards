 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on dynamical aspects of rod-bearing                  polymer solutions.  Tracer self-diffusivities of fluorescently                  tagged rodlike polymers will be measured by fluorescence                        photobleaching recovery to verify the large data set already                    obtained via light-scattering methods, and to test existing                     theories of self diffusion and its relationship to mutual                       diffusion.  Solvent mobility in such solutions will be measured                 by pulsed-field-gradient nuclear magnetic resonance techniques,                 in order to account for the increasing resistance offered by                    solvent as polymer concentration is increased.  This will, enable               a comparison with theoretical predictions made by Doi and Edwards               a decade ago, as well as more recent developments.  The diffusion               of rigid asymmetric probes through solutions of less stiff                      polymers will be measured.  Finally, an initiative into the                     behavior of rods with long, flexible sidechains-\"furry rods\"-is                 planned.  These experiments will open research into the molecular               dynamics of rods in the molten state, which relates to the                      processing of thermotropic liquid crystals.",
