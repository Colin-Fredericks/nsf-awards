 "awd_abstract_narration": "Construction management is a relatively new undergraduate discipline            with roots in Civil Engineering.  The emphasis is in teaching skills            necessary to organize, direct and control the construction process.             With construction automation becoming increasingly important in the             industry, it is equally important that undergraduates be given training         in computer applications to construction.  The two areas emphasized in          this project, construction cost estimating and project scheduling and           controls, are ideal for computer automation.  The project expands the           laboratory to provide twenty workstations equipped with microcomputers          and software for estimating and scheduling.  In addition, the                   laboratory has two plotters for printing schedule \"networks\" and five           digitizers for doing earthwork, roadway, and underground quantity take-         offs.  The assignments emphasize a \"hands-on\" approach with students            using actual construction blueprints from major jobs to do cost                 estimating and scheduling of real-life projects.                                                                                                                The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
