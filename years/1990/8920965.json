 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project contributes valuable new insights into the behavior                of firms in government-sponsored cartels and pioneers a new                     methodology in economic history by linking laboratory experiments               with analysis of important historical questions.  Part of the new               research involves further empirical analysis of the formation of                the government-sponsored citrus cartel, the structuring of firm                 production quotas within cartels, and the characteristics of                    those firms that violate and those that adhere to their quota                   allotments.  Another part of the research involves the                          development of models of the observed cartels and the design of                 experiments to test the models in the context of naturally-                     occurring institutions.                                                                                                                                         The methodologically research is especially exciting because it                 addresses a fundamental problem with historical research.  Models               developed to \"explain\" historical events often cannot be tested                 for external validity without application to independent data.                  Yet, it is generally the case in historical analysis that such                  independent data arenot available.  The advantage of laboratory                 experiments is that the researcher can replicate a microcosm of                 the historical event in the laboratory to offer independent                     verification.                                                                                                                                                   The project addresses a gap in our understanding of firm behavior               under government-sponsored cartels both from a historical                       perspective and from the perspective of current regulatory                      policy.  There has been little historical analysis of the                       individual behavior of firms in government-sponsored cartels.                   This is an important gap in our understanding because industries                are always looking to the government for protection from                        competitive pressures.  We need to know a great deal more about                 how individual firms have behaved under regulation in the past in               order to make well-informed policy in this area.",
