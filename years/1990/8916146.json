 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a collaborative effort between teams of                 U.S. and Japanese researchers aimed at furthering our understanding             of the interaction of blood flow with both normal blood vessel                  walls and with vessels engineered from substitute materials.  The               application of this information includes fluid dynamics as a factor             in vascular disease, but more importantly the development of                    biological tissue substitutes for the restoration of cardiovascular             function, i.e. tissue engineering.  The engineering development of              small-bore grafts is urgently needed, and to successfully do this               requires an understanding of the fluid dynamic environment of such              grafts and the interaction of flow with the vessel wall at a                    cellular level.  In this effort, the U.S. and Japanese investigators            will conduct both complementary and joint studies over a two-year               period.  Specific experiments will be directed at defining the flow             environment and determining associated cellular responses, including            both the adhesion of blood cells and alterations in endothelial                 cells, the cells which line the inner arterial walls and interface              directly with flowing blood.  The principal investigators are Dr.               Robert M. Nerem, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Dr. Norio                 Ohshima, University of Tsukuba, Japan.  Other co-investigators are              from the Biomechanics Laboratory at Georgia Institute of Technology             and from three Japanese institutions: the University of Hokkaido, the           Kawasaki Medical School, and the University of Tsukuba.",
