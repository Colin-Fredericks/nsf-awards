 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                    chemistry and in the subfield of surface chemical studies of                    oxidic materials.  Professor J. H. Lunsford will continue his                   studies of the transformation of methane to higher hydrocarbons                 over oxidic catalysts.  A major focus of this work will be on                   the role of additives and promoters which affect the kinetics                   of methanation.  In particular, magnesium and sodium oxide                      catalysts will be studied.  The role of the surface oxide and                   peroxide constituents is examined in understanding the rate                     limiting step in coupling of methyl radicals.  Professor                        Lunsford's previous work was considered ground breaking in the                  discovery of this key intermediate in methanation.                              Spectroscopic probes (electron spin resonance and x-ray                         photoelectron) of the surface oxide structure and composition                   will be used.  A new study of complex oxidic structures based                   on perovskites and solid solutions of zirconium and calcium                     oxides will be initiated.  These studies will help develop                      novel catalysts for this important industrial process.",
