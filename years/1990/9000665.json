 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a Research Experiences for               Undergraduates Site in the Department of Biology and Biomedical                 Sciences at Washington University.  Twelve undergraduates, from a               diversity of collegiate and ethnic backgrounds, will be recruited               to spend 8-12 summer weeks engaged in developmental biology                     research with faculty mentors who will be selected, on the basis                of mutual interests, from the about 30 developmental biologists on              the faculty.  These staff members have active, well-equipped and                funded research groups working on a wide range of developmental                 problems, ranging from mating and zygote formation in                           chlamydomonas, through organ-specific gene expression in transgenic             plants, and control of germ cell differentiation in nematodes, to               formation of patterned connections in the mammalian CNS.  The                   emphasis of the program will be on getting each student actively                engaged in increasingly independent research in one of these                    productive laboratories.  However, to help the students view their              own research in a broader scientific and professional context, four             supplementary activities will be provided:  (1) One week will be                devoted full-time to introducing the REU students to some of the                major research models and methods of contemporary developmental                 biology, through a coordinated series of lectures, discussions,                 demonstrations and hands-on laboratory experiences.  (2) In each                odd-numbered week, a member of the participating faculty will                   present an informal research seminar and discussion, designed                   specifically for these students.  (3) In even-numbered weeks, the               students will participate with Washington University graduate                   students, postdocs and faculty in an ongoing Developmental Biology              Journal Club.  (4) At the end of the summer, a weekend retreat will             be held at which students in this program, together with other                  summer undergraduate research students, will present the results                of their summer research either orally or as poster papers.",
