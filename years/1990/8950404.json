 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at Case                  Western Reserve University to develop a modern laboratory course                in neurobiology for undergraduates.  The course will include an                 introduction to the major concepts and techniques of modern                     neuroscience.  Specifically, it will demonstrate (1) the                        biophysical properties of the membranes of nerve cells using the                techniques of patch clamping, (2) the chemical properties of                    nerve cells using the techniques of immunocytochemistry, and (3)                the electrical properties of nerve cells and their connections                  using the techniques of electrophysiology.  This laboratory will                form a central part of a \"track\" in neurobiology which is                       currently being implemented by the Department of Biology.  It is                one of a series of tracks which will involve leading researchers,               state-of-the-art equipment, and opportunities for research                      projects, will attract larger numbers of undergraduates,                        including women and minorities, into the sciences.  Neurobiology                is especially effective in drawing students into scientific                     research because of its focus on the cellular basis of animal                   land human behavior, and its clinical relevance.  The grantee is                matching the award with non-Federal sources.",
