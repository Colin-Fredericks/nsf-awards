 "awd_abstract_narration": "A social welfare function is a formula for aggregating conflicting              individual preferences into a social preference scheme to be used               for collective decision making.  The formula should satisfy basic               demographic values or axioms.  K.J.Arrow received the Noble prize               in part for his proof of the Impossibility Theorem, i.e., that it               is impossible to construct a social welfare function consistent                 with basic assumptions of equity and economics.  The Impossibility              Theorem has survived many attempts to restore consistency by                    weakening these axioms.  Unlike other treatments of the                         Impossibility Theorem which simply seek to extend standard theorems             in welfare economics, the investigator has developed methods for                exploiting the algebraic and topological structure of the standard              allocation models to obtain very general insights into public                   choice.  For example, the investigator proved recently that the                 social welfare function is either completely unresponsive to                    individual preference or there is some individual who is denied any             share in the economy's private goods at every turn.  The project                continues to investigate social choice in economic environments                 under weaker transitivity assumptions, in models with public and                private goods, under less demanding and more realistic preference               revelation desiderata, and in intergenerational social choice                   models.                                                                                                                                                         The contribution of this project comes from developing a new way                of looking at the question of providing an axiomatic foundation for             public decision making.  The investigator has already succeeded in              proving new theorems about the trade-offs between equity and                    efficiency in the types of economic settings found in real-world                public policy problems.  Further development of this promising                  approach is warranted because the new methods will provide useful               tools for analyzing collective choice and substantial new insights              into many economic problems.",
