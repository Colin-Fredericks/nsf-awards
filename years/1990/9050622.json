 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grinnell College is establishing a laser facility with equipment                necessary to integrated the study of lasers and modern optics into              the physics curriculum.  The physics department is equipping a                  laser facility with simple, reliable laser systems whose                        capabilities can be fully used by undergraduates.  The equipment                includes multi-color and open-frame helium-neon lasers, optical                 spectrum analyzers, power meters, optical mounting hardware, and                materials for building two general-purpose diode laser controllers              and a carbon dioxide laser.  With this equipment the department is              developing lecture demonstrations that will interest and motivate               introductory (and non-science major) students to learn about basic              laws of light, color, and vision; developing laboratory experiments             to be carried out by students in intermediate and advanced physics              courses to examine lasers and their properties; and providing the               opportunity for advanced students to engage in independent study                and laser-construction projects that will help to prepare them for              graduate study of careers in industry.  The equipment allows three              levels of instruction, from observation of demonstrations through               use of lasers in the laboratory and study of the laser itself and               thus gives beginning students some background in an important area              of physics while allowing advanced undergraduates to understand                 lasers as a basic piece of scientific instrumentation.  The college             is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
