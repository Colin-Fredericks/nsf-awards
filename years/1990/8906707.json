 "awd_abstract_narration": "Speciation - the process through which new species arise -                 remains one of the most controversial (and poorly understood)                   aspects of the study of animal diversity.  Natural hybridization                events between closely related species provide unique                           opportunities to investigate the genetic basis of species                       differences and the nature of the barriers to gene exchange that                tend to keep species distinct.  Information about the                           distribution and number of genes that contribute to genetic                     isolation can be gained from analysis of the distribution of                    genotypes within and adjacent to a hybrid zone.  This project                   will document, at high resolution, patterns of genetic variation                in a very well-characterized zone of hybridization between                      closely related insect species.  These genetic analyses will be                 coupled with studies of both pre-mating and post-mating barriers                to gene exchange (factors that cause reproductive isolation).                   The project will take advantage of recombinant DNA technology to                identify a set of restriction fragment length polymorphisms                     (RFLPs), which will serve as the genetic markers to analyze the                 extent and direction of hybridization and backcrossing and the                  consequences for the flow of alleles from one species into the                  other.  The discovery of RFLPs has provided an enormously useful                set of markers for human geneticists studying inherited diseases                and holds great promise for genetic studies of natural                          populations of other species as well.  The approaches and                       understanding developed in the course of this study will be                     useful in a variety of contexts.",
