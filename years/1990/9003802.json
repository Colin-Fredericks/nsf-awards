 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research in elementary particle physics will                   focus on (1) The phenomenological and cosmological implications                 of extra Higgs bosons, (2) The implications for supersymmetry                   if a Higgs boson were to be discovered within the next two                      years, (3) Study of whether a potential instability of the                      standard model ground state is empirically acceptable, and (4)                  A proposal for a new class of experiments searching for lepton                  number violation at the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator                    Facility.                                                                            The Higgs bosons represent the one aspect of the weak                      nuclear force about which essentially nothing is yet known.                     Yet, they are a very central aspect of our understanding of                     this force.  Thus, study of these bosons is extremely                           important.  Lepton number violation has never been seen, but                    its existence is predicted by a number of intriguing models, so                 searching for it is of considerable interest.",
