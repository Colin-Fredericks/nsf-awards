 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Chicago will sponsor a planning conference                    to focus on the mathematics preparation for teaching                            elementary school.  The conference is being guided by an                        organizing committee which includes members from four other                     teacher education institutions within Illinois.  The                            conference participants will meet twice, once in January and                    again in May 1991.  In between the two sessions, the                            participants will work on positions and plans coming out of                     the conference.  The conference participants will include                       mathematicians, mathematics educators, teachers, scientist,                     and others from research institutions as well as traditional                    teacher education institutions with large teacher education                     enrollments.  The conference proceedings will be widely                         disseminated through additional funding from the EXXON                          Foundation.  The proceedings will consist of carefully                          delineated issues and possible approaches to address those                      issues.  The intent is to generate a set of possible                            alternative responses, supported by sound rational, and to                      stimulate the field to work seriously and collectively to                       improve the preparation of teachers in mathematics.                                                                                                             The cost sharing is over 50% of the NSF funding.",
