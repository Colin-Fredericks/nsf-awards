 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a profile measurement laboratory.  The                 equipment includes state of the art equipment to trace the profiles of          engineering surfaces, necessary filters, a powerful microcomputer               system for on-line date recording and analysis, and a high resolution           monitor to display the profiles and results.  The system uses standard          specimens from the National Bureau of Standards for reference                   measurements.  This project enables students in four manufacturing              engineering courses to use the equipment and measure the profiles and           roughness of engineering surfaces.  It also effectively illustrates             several manufacturing concepts including the usefulness of surface              roughness data in determining the functionally of parts as well as in           diagnosing the condition of production processes.  Experiments focus on         the effect of cutoff, cutting conditions, use of cutting fluid, wear,           and different production processes on the surface roughness of parts.           Databases developed as a part of this project are used by students for          the improvement of their skills in designing quality specifications and         selecting manufacturing processes to meet customer quality requirements         with optimum cost effectiveness.  The award is being matched by an              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            //",
