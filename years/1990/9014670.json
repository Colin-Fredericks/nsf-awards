A balance will be struck in the               platform and poster programs between presentations by senor and                 by junior persons. Opportunities will be provided for graduate                  and postdoctoral students to present their own work, often for                  the first time, and to observe examples of excellence for them to               emulate. To ensure the latter, there will be an invited keynote                 speaker for each of the four sessions (Sherri Brown, Plant                      Development; Don Ready, Cell Architecture and Development; Mark                 Muskavitch, Genomic Control of Development; and David Stocum,                   Regeneration and Repair), as well as a keynote address by Carol                 Erickson, who will describe her investigations of neural crest                  cell migration. There also will be scheduled visits to                          laboratories within the Department of Biological Sciences (those                of Robinson, Asai, Ready, and Vanable), to enable conferees to                  learn first hand the approaches taken by these investigators, and               to see some of the major techniques used in their labs. The                     extensive interaction among students, faculty, and invited                      speakers will promote the exchange of new information and an                    enthusiasm for teaching and research in developmental biology.",
