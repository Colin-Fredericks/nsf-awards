 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historical perspective is essential in order to understand the             nature of the relationship between human activity and the environment           and to evaluate long-term productivity of sustainability or impact.             The introduction of livestock into Mexico in the sixteenth century              modified the subsistence strategies of the indigenous population as             well as the pre-existing dynamic equilibrium among the population,              production systems, and the environment.  This doctoral dissertation            research will document the development of the livestock industry in the         Coixtlahuaca Basin of northwestern Oaxaca, Mexico, and it will examine          that industry's impact on the way of life of the population and on the          regional environment over the last 450 years.  This project will                combine data from field observations with information derived from              archival research.  The investigator will map current and past land             uses and will establish and date depositional sediment and paleosol             sequences along several stream channels.  He will review                        ethnohistorical sources from which information on land uses, economic           activities, community boundaries, resource availability, droughts, crop         failures, diseases and populations of the area will be extracted, and           he will compare these data with those of the present.                                                                                                                Our understanding of long-term processes relating to environmental         and cultural systems remains limited.  This study is unusual in its             effort to delineate the man-land relationship in the past and to carry          the relationship through to the present.  The research will contribute          to the scientific basis of our understanding of human-environmental             relationships.  The project also will provide an excellent opportunity          for a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent                research skills.",
