Anderson of the American Museum of Natural                    History  will continue their survey work on mammalian diversity                 in Bolivia, by conducting five elevational transects through the                Andes Mountains in the Yungas and Valles region between 500 and                 3000 M and obtain representative specimens, genetic material, and               parasites from all ecological zones.  The study is also designed                to involve Bolivian students and professionals, thus, providing                 training in conservation and biodiversity, and to continue to                   collaborate with and expedite the studies of other workers doing                research on South American mammals.                                                  Few South American countries are as biologically unknown as                Bolivia.  This is particularly true of the largely unexplored,                  biologically diverse regions to be examined in this study.  Much                of this area has been opened to large scale development and                     deforestation.  Information provided by this study will provide a               critical baseline for evaluating the future impact of this                      development on the biodiversity of the region and will provide an               important database for broad scale comparative research.  It will               also provide important training for Bolivian biologists wishing                 to continue this type of work in Bolivia.",
