 "awd_abstract_narration": "The naphthylphthalamic acid receptor (NPAR) is a plant cell                     plasma membrane protein that plays a pivotal role in the                        regulation of the movement of the plant hormone auxin.  NPAR is                 being isolated from zucchini using a combination of                             immunoaffinity and chromatographic techniques.  Flavenoids are                  shown to be NPAR ligands in vitro but the natural ligands are not               known.  Several specific flavenoids are being studied to                        determine the in vivo ligand.                                                                                                                                   Auxin movement in plants is particularly important to their                     growth and development.  The polar transport of auxin from its                  multiple sites of synthesis in the shoot apex and young leaves                  downward to the tissues in which it acts allows for a                           coordination of growth and development in disparate plant parts                 and helps maintain the developmental polarity of the plant body.                The more local movement of auxin in and out of plant cells                      affects levels of free auxin in individual cellular compartments                containing receptors for auxin's actions.  The regulation of                    auxin movement is a major control point in plant development.                   Understanding how the NPA receptor works to control movement of                 auxin in plants would be a major contribution to our                            understanding of the way that auxin plays its pattern-generating                and coordinating role in plant development and will advance our                 ability to manipulate plant growth for agricultural purposes.",
