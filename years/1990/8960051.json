 "awd_abstract_narration": "High energy density batteries are the power sources of choice                   for a variety of military and consumer applications.                            Presently, much of the primary battery needs are met by                         lithium (Li) systems.  A problem with Li batteries has been                     their tendency to exhibit unsafe behavior due in some part to                   the low melting point of Li.  To overcome this problem, an                      anode with similar properties to Li but with a higher melting                   point is worth exploring, for example magnesium (Mg).  The                      overall goal of this study is to develop a high energy density                  Mg battery which will have the high power capabilities of Li                    systems such as Li/SOCi2 and Li/SO2 cells, but would be                         significantly safer, and would not have the startup (voltage                    delay) problems of aqueous Mg batteries.  The key to the                        successful development of such a battery would be the                           selection of an electrolyte solution in which Mg will be                        stable under both open-circuit and discharge conditions.  A                     perceived advantage of sulfur dioxide (SO2) as a solvent is                     that the protective films formed on Mg from its reaction with                   SO2 would be insoluble in this solvent making the Mg anode                      highly stable.  Specific uses of the Mg batteries will include                  communication devices, robotics, hand-held tools, toys,                         military and space equipment and biomedical devices.                                                                                                            This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I will consist                    of experimental work to test the feasibility of developing                      high energy density batteries utilizing Mg as the anode.  SO2                   will be used either as a cathode depolarizer or as an                           electrolyte solvent.  In the latter configuration, the cathode                  depolarizer will be either CuF2 or NiF2.                                        Two specific tasks will be performed:                                           (1) Electrolyte characterization - electrolytes comprised of                    Mg(AlCl4)2 or Mg(GaCl4)2 in SO2 will be prepared and their                      conductivities determined.                                                      (2) Fabrication and testing of laboratory Mg cells -  The                       electrochemical tests will include measurement of the open-                     circuit potential of the cells at different temperatures, for                   example, -20, 0 and 25oC, determination of their discharge                      capacities at a variety of current densities and temperatures,                  and an evaluation of the storage behavior of the cells.",
