 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bay Area Earth Science Institute (BAESI), is a cross-                       disciplinary, summer workshop for secondary school earth and                    physical science educators.  Starting in July, 1990 BAESI                       will bring together experts from academia, government                           agencies, and industry in a community wide effort to improve                    the earth science backgrounds and teaching skills of middle                     and senior high school educators in the San Francisco Bay                       Area.  Each summer 38 science teachers from local school                        districts will meet at San Jose State University to receive                     in-depth instruction on topics ranging from earthquakes and                     plate tectonics, mineral and energy resources, to weather,                      climate and water issues.  The workshop will run for four                       weeks, Monday through Friday.  Topic development in the                         Monday through Thursday morning sessions will be complemented                   by afternoon sessions involving interactive laboratory                          experiments and innovative teaching method presentations.                       These sessions will include computer-assisted instruction and                   training on BAESEnet a computer network designed to aid                         participants after the summer workshop is completed.  Each                      Friday participants will travel to the field to learn how                       natural features such as fault scarps, landslides, beaches,                     and local resources such as university seismographs and                         mineral collections can be used to enhance classroom topic                      development and provide alternatives to traditional science                     teaching methods.                                                                                                                                               Participants will receive stipends, commuting costs, and                        materials packets from the National Science Foundation and                      industry sponsors.  Participants will also be given the                         opportunity to earn up to four units of advanced college                        credit.  In addition, industries and other businesses who                       sponsor participants from economically disadvantaged school                     districts will provide support for classroom earth science                      projects and field trips during the following academic year.                                                                                                    Each year workshop participants will help in the development                    or modification of the BAESI educator's workbook, a                             compendium of the most useful and innovative classroom,                         laboratory and field exercises.  This workbook will also                        contain participant work addresses and will be available to                     all previous BAESI participants.  Outstanding participants                      will be targeted for the Mentor Teacher program and will be                     asked to serve as instructors in future workshops.  The                         program strongly encourages minority educator participants                      and participants from school districts with high minority                       enrollments.                                                                                                                                                    Cost sharing in the amount of $169,700 equals 73% of the NSF                    award.",
