 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agricultural practices throughout the world have been                      revolutionized within the last half-century.  New crop hybrids,                 chemical fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, and irrigation and            drainage systems have substantially increased production.  In many              areas, land reform and changing land-use patterns also have boosted             yields.  The degree to which new technologies and socioeconomic changes         have affected agricultural responses to climatic extremes has not been          studied in detail, however.  This project will examine this                     relationship by focusing on the degree to which climatic fluctuations,          especially drought, have affected agricultural production in Mexico             during the 20th Century.  Meteorological records, data from                     agricultural censuses and reports, and accounts in popular publications         will be used to reconstruct and map dynamic patterns of production and          to relate those patterns to changing technological and socioeconomic            conditions.  Statistical analyses will assess the correlation between           climate and crop yields, the degree to which new technologies have              buffered the agricultural system against climatic variability, and the          differences in drought impacts among different land-use regimes.  These         general analyses will be complemented by four case studies of                   vulnerability to drought that will rely on local records and interviews         with local residents.  These case studies will try to show how                  environmental, technological, and socioeconomic changes have altered            the impacts of climate on local agricultural systems.                                This project will contribute to our general understandings of the          ways that altered forms of social and economic activity affect human            responses to changing natural conditions.  It will also enhance our             insights about the degree to which technological change makes societies         more or less resistant to environmental fluctuations, and it will               provide valuable information about the dynamics of agriculture in               Mexico, a nation that is representative of others that have been                strongly impacted by the \"Green Revolution.\"",
