 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of five young U.S. biologists             in an international conference addressing the relatively new role of            experimental genetics in the study of developmental biology.  The               conference was jointly organized by several European and American               scientists, including William F. Dove of University of Wisconsin and            Francois Jacob of the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.  The meeting             is to be held May 7 - 11, 1990, in Provence, France.  The participants          have a common intellectual starting point - an understanding of                 phages and an appreciation of genetical experimental systems, i.e.,             the discovery of salient developmental mutants to identify key                  developmenal elements.  However, they work with a wide variety of               organisms including bacteria, nematodes, plants, drosophila, birds              and mice.  The conference will review the successes and limitations             of this approach, familiarize the 30 or so participants with the                experimental systems being used, and encourage new modes of thinking            about developmental biology for the coming decade.                                                                                                              Specific themes of the meeting include control of transcription                 versus post-translational interactions; lineages and polar divisions;           cell interaction and signalling; and the genetics of dispensible                versus essential developmental processes.  The framework of the                 meeting is integrative questions such as: How broadly can one use               the formalisms of regulatory loops to extend our understanding of               development?  In what ways does the reductionist tradition work, and            in what ways not?  What useful paradigm replaces the nineteenth                 century dualism of preformation/epigenesis?  Participants include               several leading contributors to this field as well as some promising            younger scientists who will shape the future of developmental biology.",
