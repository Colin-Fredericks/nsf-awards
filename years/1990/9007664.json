 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international conference is proposed on \"Multicellular                       Behavior of Bacterial: In Nature, Industry and the Laboratory\" to               be held at Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory.  October 21-                25, 1990.  The objective of the conference is to examine the                    importance of bacterial multicellularity in a wide range of                     situations, including environmental biofilms, mats and colonies,                bioreactors, bacterial pathogenesis and bacterial development on                laboratory media.  This is the first conference devoted specially               to consideration of bacteria as multicellular organisms.  The                   meeting has been organized to stimulate interaction between                     scientists who study bacterial multicellularity from different                  perspectives, such as fermentation and bioreactor engineers,                    molecular biologists interested in signal transduction, microbial               ecologists, medical microbiologists, etc.  It is expected that                  new insights will emerge into the roles of cell-cell                            communication and multicellular organization in bacterial                       activity, thereby helping to generate new concepts and research                 strategies relevant to a wide range of disciplines.  Areas where                the ideas generated at the meeting may be applied in practice                   include biofouling, bioreactor design, biodeterioration and                     corrosion.",
