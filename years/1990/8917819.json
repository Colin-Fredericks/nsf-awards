 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complete inventory of the estimated 17,000 species of                    ferns, conifers, and flowering plants of the Middle American                    tropics is the goal of an ambitious multi-investigator, multi-                  national program of research coordinated at the Missouri                        Botanical Garden, under Dr. Gerrit Davidse.  Flora Mesoamericana,               in the form of a traditional published series of books and as a                 parallel computerized data base, is a synoptic inventory of the                 vascular plants that provides descriptions of basic plant                       features, a comprehensive identification guide, a summary of                    geographical ranges for each species, and a standardized                        synthesis of the taxonomy of all the plants.  Mesoamerica                       includes Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras,                  Guatemala, Belize, plus the Mexican states of Chiapas, Quintana                 Roo, Campeche, Yucatan, and Tabasco.                                                 Taxonomic work is being contributed by staff members of the                Missouri Botanical Garden, the National University in Mexico                    City, and the British Museum of Natural History.  Cooperative                   planning and participation of Mesoamerican botanists are major                  features of the project.  The flora volumes are being published                 in Spanish in Mexico through the National University; the                       computer databases initially are being developed in St. Louis and               in London, and will be extended to the Mexico City station.  The                first published volumes will treat the monocots (grasses, sedges,               lilies, and relatives) and the ferns; subsequent volumes will                   treat the dicots and the gymnosperms.  There is no comparable                   inventory of the rich plant resources of this vast region,                      portions of which are changing rapidly through human disturbance                and development.",
