 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Bioscience and                   Biotechnology at Drexel University to purchase equipment which will             help to improve an existing undergraduate ecology program, to                   increase the number of women and minorities in ecology, and to                  improve the science education of prospective teachers.  Using a                 research boat, field vehicle (van), and modern instruments a group              of faculty from the Department of Bioscience and Biotechnology                  teach undergraduates how to conduct modern scientific research on               aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in the Philadelphia area.  This              involves formal course work and independent student research                    projects in aquatic ecology, biophysical ecology, and animal                    behavior.  In addition, this project also seeks to increase the                 number of minorities and women in ecology by a coordinated effort               at the undergraduate and high school levels.  Local community                   groups and officials are involved in the selection of undergraduate             scholars that will receive full tuition scholarships from the                   University and in the selection of students to participate in                   Saturday morning science programs.  Prospective teachers will also              be involved in the undergraduate ecology program through                        coordination with the teacher preparation program at Drexel.  Major             items of equipment in this award include a research boat, field                 vehicle, a water quality data system, a portable photosynthesis                 apparatus, and microclimatology instruments for field experiments;              a controlled climate chamber, telemetry data logging system, and                video system for lab experiments in ecology and animal behavior;                and microcomputers for data analysis and mathematical modeling in               ecology.  The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal                   sources.",
