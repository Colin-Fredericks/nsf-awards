 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dalechampia is a genus of vines of the poinsettia family                   (Euphorbiaceae) common throughout the lowland tropics in Asia,                  Africa, and the Americas.  Although much is now known about the                 species diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and pollination                  biology of the New World species, in large part because of Dr.                  Scott Armbruster's studies over the last ten years, relatively                  little is known about Old World species.  Dalechampia is being                  employed as a model system for the study of how tropical plants                 evolve in response to selective pressures generated by                          specialized pollinators.  Old World species must be integrated                  into these studies to complete a phylogenetic analysis of the                   entire genus.  Furthermore, accurate floristic inventories (used                in making management and conservation decisions) of tropical                    regions of the Old World as well as the New depend on reliable                  taxonomic information for common species such as Dalechampia.                        In the Old World, Dalechampia is most diverse in Madagascar                and southern Africa.  Dr. Armbruster will collect herbarium                     specimens in this region along with liquid-preserved material,                  for morphological and biochemical analyses, including analyses of               the unusual resins and fragrance compounds produced by the plants               and used by pollinating bees.  Observations of the behavior of                  pollinating animals will also be made.  Morphological data will                 be analyzed using cladistic methods to determine likely                         phylogenetic trees that show relationships among Old World taxa                 and between Old and New World groups.  These results will improve               the classification system for Dalechampia, indicate likely                      migratory pathways in the evolution of Old and New World species,               and determine the origins of the various pollination mechanisms                 found in these plants.",
