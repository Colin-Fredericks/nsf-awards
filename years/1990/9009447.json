This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or                             complimentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions                 in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                           This award will support an 18-month visit by Dr. Mark Kellum                    to work with Professor Etienne Ghys of L'\u001acole Normale                          Sup\u001arieure de Lyon in Lyon, France, on \"Qualitatively                           Riemannian Foliations.\"  The proposal concerns ongoing                          research into the structure of qualitatively Riemannian                         foliations on compact manifolds, a continuation of research                     the principal investigator began with his thesis, where he                      showed that the Molino theory on leaf closures in Riemannian                    foliations generalizes to the qualitatively Riemannian                          situation.  In his thesis, he employed the theory of locally                    compact transformation groups.  This theory, together with                      results due to Sacksteder, Furstenberg and Ellis in measure-                    theoretic and topological dynamics, suggests studying the                       closure of the holonomy pesudogroup, when it consists of                        equicontinuous or distal local homeomorphisms.  These                           theories also suggest a relaxation of our original                              differentiability assumptions on the holonomy pseudogroup of                    local metric isometries.  Ghys also points to many of the                       same results in his treatment of qualitatively Riemannian                       foliations.",
