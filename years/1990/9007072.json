 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently, the investigators have                                                demonstrated that multiple quantum                                              well structures consisting of very                                              thin (10A) alternating layers of two                                            crystalline organic semiconductors                                              can be grown by the new ultrahigh                                               vacuum process of organic molecular                                             beam epitaxy (OMBE).  X-ray and                                                 birefringence data indicate that the                                            structures are highly ordered both                                              in the stacking direction, as well                                              as across the water surface.  Thus,                                             the growth is considered to be                                                  \"quasi-epitaxial\" in that this                                                  ordering occurs even though the                                                 lattices of the two organic                                                     materials are incommensurate.                                                   Control of the crystalline texture                                              is strongly influenced by the                                                   dependence of molecular surface                                                 mobility on temperature.  For                                                   example, the highest degree of                                                  crystalline ordering is observed for                                            substrates cooled to less than 100                                              K.  In the proposed work, the                                                   investigator will use a laser in                                                conjunction with their OMBE system                                              to locally heat the cooled substrate                                            during growth, thus creating highly                                             defined regions of both ordered and                                             disordered growth.  This fine                                                   control of both layer order, as well                                            as the already demonstrated ability                                             to grow very thin films, should                                                 allow them to understand, and hence                                             control the growth processes to a                                               high degree.  This control will be                                              utilized to fabricate several                                                   optical devices such as gratings and                                            waveguides.  Futhermore, by making                                              structures consisting of very thin                                              (< 10 A), deeply layered (> 100                                                 period) multi-layered stacks, they                                              may be able to break the                                                        centrosymmetry characteristic of                                                crystalline semiconductors.  They,                                              in turn, should lead to a                                                       significant second-order non-linear                                             optical response.  Thus, they will                                              grow such structures and probe their                                            linear and non-linear optical                                                   properties using the same laser                                                 system employed for the laser-                                                  assisted growth experiments.",
