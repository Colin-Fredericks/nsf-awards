 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ambitious proposal to advance the foundation of risk and             decision analysis.  The research focuses on decisions where                     incomplete or conflicting knowledge creates ambiguity about the                 probability of an event.  In order to account for ambiguity                     aversion, the models to be investigated contain modifications to                utilities rather than probabilities.  Also, the proposed research               is based on the concept of situation specific utility functions.                                                                                                The planned investigation will look at three important issues: the              impact of probability ambiguity on choice, the incorporation of                 equity in social risk management, and the extension of generalized              utility theory.  The emphasis for each issue is on building and                 testing models.  The general research strategy will be based on                 parallel theoretical development and empirical analysis.  This                  coordination between theory and data should lead to improved models             that can be applied in operational contexts.",
