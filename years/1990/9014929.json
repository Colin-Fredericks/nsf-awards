 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Snowbird conference has been held biennially at                        Snowbird, Utah in the summer of each even-numbered year since                   1974.  The Conference provides a forum in which the                             administrators of the Ph.D-granting academic computing                          departments, research laboratory managers, representatives from                 government agencies, and other interested parties can meet to                   explore and discuss issues important to the development of                      computing research.  The 1990 Snowbird Conference will be                       consistent with this mission.                                                        The Computing Research Board (CRB) is inviting six resource                persons from non-member academic institutions to serve on panels                and as workshop leaders on such topics as Human Resources                       (increasing the involvement of underrepresented groups in                       computer research), Educational Pipelines issues, and Curriculum                improvement.  Also, invited will be four representatives from                   Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).  The latter               invitees could increase their awareness on the issues relating to               computing research and provide insight into mechanisms for                      increasing minority representation in computing research for the                other participants at Snowbird.                                                      The Conference is being held July 8-10, 1990 in Snowbird,                  Utah",
