 "awd_abstract_narration": "The P.I.'s currently interested in research in massively                        parallel, disturbed, and collective computations,                               artificial neural systems, learning machines,                                   associative neural memories, photonic computing, and                            optical neural network implementations.  In the area                            of neural networks, he plans to investigate the                                 performance of various associative neural memory                                architectures and related recording/learning                                    algorithms.  He has introduced new high-performance                             recording/learning algorithms for associative                                   memories, and is currently investigating the dynamics                           of such neural memories for various                                             recording/learning algorithms.  In the Computation                              and Neural Networks Laboratory, he and his students                             are developing unsupervised learning self-optimizing                            neural net architectures for clustering and                                     unsupervised pattern classification.  In another                                project, neural net architectures will be employed in                           solving complex optimal path finding problems in two-                            and higher-dimensions.  He will also be investigating                          the optical implementations of artificial neural                                systems.  He holds a patent for the first integrated                            optical threshold gate (\"optical neuron\") and has                               developed fiber optic cross-bar network fabrication                             techniques, which are potentially useful in optical                             neural network implementations.  He has recently                                completed the design and implementation of a fiber                              optic-base high-performance dynamic associative                                 neural memory prototype.  He is also interested in                              the application of neural networks in signal                                    processing and parallel  computing.  In a joint effort                          with researchers at Wayne State's Neurology                                     Department, he is developing a neural-network-based                             technique for automatic quantification of the clinical                          Electromyogram (EMG) for clinical diagnostic                                    purposes.  His future research will focus on adaptive                           unsupervised synthesis techniques for high-                                     performance dynamic artificial neural networks.  He                             will also be investigating ways of speeding up learning                         in multiple-layer neural nets through self-optimizing                           neural architectures.  His future research will also                            involve proposing and implementing large scale high-                            performance fiber optic interconnected dynamic                                  associative neural memories and other neural                                    network paradigms.",
