 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Combinatorics of                       Professor James Lawrence of George Mason University. Dr.                        Lawrence's project is to investigate the concept of a Radon                     partition of a finite set in Euclidean space, and to generalize                 and extend this concept in the context of oriented matroids.                         This research falls in the broad category of Combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, Combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, Combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
