 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conventional database systems process all the data (related to a                query) before providing a response. This project develops new                   query processing methods suitable for the database management                   systems (DBMS) when they are to respond to estimation, error-                   constrained and time-constrained queries, or when there is no                   need or there is not enough time to process all the data related                to the query. This approach incorporates sampling and sample                    size determination mechanisms into DBMS so that, with a given                   user's requirement (e.g., timing or error constraints), the DBMS                can determine an appropriate amount of sample tuples that need to               be processed in order to produce acceptable estimations for                     aggregate relational queries.                                                                                                                                   The goal of this research is to provide efficient methods for                   DBMS that will be able to effectively support time- and error-                  constrained environments, and serve for other statistical                       purposes. Furthermore, these facilities will also provide                       ordinary users with convenient working environments enabling the                users to get statistical information about the database as soon                 (or as precise) as they wish by specifying the timing                           constraints, sampling fractions or error constraints. Such                      statistically enhanced DBMSs will find a wide variety of                        applications.",
