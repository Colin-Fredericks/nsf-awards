 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will conduct an ethnographic                 study of households' budgeting decisions and the importance of                  trust, in relation to market factors, in informal lending                       practices in urban Zambia.  The questions asked are how personal                trust is used in informal and semi-formal credit relationships,                 and how trust is maintained across changing and difficult                       economic situations.                                                                                                                                            Methods include participant observation, semi-structured                        interviews, survey sampling of a number of households, and an                   extensive period of budget recording and analysis of a smaller                  sample of households.                                                                                                                                           This research is important because informal economic relations                  are becoming more and more significant in both developed and                    developing countries as economies worsen.  Increased                            understanding of the strategies and issues that poor urban                      households follow in obtaining necessary cash for subsistence                   will help decision makers deal with potential causes of urban                   discontent.",
