 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues and expands previous research by the                principal investigators on the magnetic properties of single-                   magnetic-domain magnetite particles produced by bacteria.  The                  effects of time, temperature, and particle interactions in                      single-magnetic-domain magnetite particles will be investigated.                The experiments are timely because of the recent availability of                new samples of bacterial magnetite in addition to the material                  studied in the previous research.  Bacterial magnetite offers                   important advantages over other synthetic and natural                           magnetites; a) uniformity in particle size; and b) reduced                      effects of particle interactions.  The project involves                         thermoremanent magnetization, thermal demagnetization of partial                thermoremanent magnetizations, field and temperature dependence                 of viscous remanent magnetization, and various paleointensity                   methods which use anhysteretic magnetization.  The magnetite                    particles from the two new strains of magnetite producing                       anaerobic bacteria have distinctly different particle sizes and                 morphologies from each other and from those of the previously                   studied microaerophilic bacteria.  Their magnetic properties                    will be studies because of their potential significance to the                  stable remanence of sediments.  In particular, this research will               provide an experimental basis for understanding the effects of                  magnetostatic interactions and particle-size distributions on the               time and temperature dependence of single-magnetic-domain                       particles.",
