Sargeant Reynolds Community College, to develop a                               comprehensive plan which will significantly increase the                        number and quality of minority, particularly black,                             scientists and engineers.                                                                                                                                       Building on extensive existing program aimed at increasing                      the number of blacks entering higher education, the Virginia                    Alliance considerably enhances these efforts, focuses on                        recruiting blacks into science and engineering careers,                         ensures continuity by tracking students beyond the short                        terms of current projects, and provides a structure that will                   greatly improve the flow of students among the respective                       institutions.  The Virginia Alliance will marshal all                           available resources and provide a comprehensive plan so that                    each black student with potential and interest in science                       will complete his or her science education and enter the                        workforce.                                                                                                                                                      We will concentrate on undergraduates with the following                        programs:                                                                       Undergraduate Research Participation; Student Study Groups;                     Students Summer Workshops; Curriculum Revision; and Faculty                     Workshops.  Industry and government laboratory                                  representatives will participates with faculty in a number of                   these activities.  Additionally, the program will help                          students through the important transition points from high                      school to graduate school by extensive mentoring at all                         phases.",
