 "awd_abstract_narration": "This experimental program will concentrate or reactions of                      chromium species with oxygen and chlorine.  Three unique                        facilities will be used:  a high temperature, fast flow                         reactor with laser-induced fluorescence monitoring of the Cr                    radicals; a high temperature, atmospheric pressure,                             photochemistry metal reactor; and a low pressure flow reactor                   coupled to a mass spectrometer.  Like the past work on                          aluminum reactions, due attention will be paid to the                           fundamental aspects of the results.  The temperature range to                   be investigated is 900 to 1900 K, with pressures form 10-2 to                   1.0 bar.                                                                                                                                                        The formation of metal compounds in incineration, whether as                    particulates or gaseous emissions, has been identified as an                    important economic and health problem.  Little is known about                   the process involved in the formation and disappearance of                      such species in incinerators.  The proposed program will                        provide accurate rate coefficient and mechanistic data on                       elementary gas-phase reactions of interest.",
