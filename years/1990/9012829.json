The                   theme of the Congress \"The Unity of Systematic and Evolutionary                 Biology\" will bring together an international assemblage of                     systematists, population biologists, and ecologists, as well as                 members of the \"user community\", for which systematics is a                     critical but undervalued resource (e.g., agroeconomists,                        government policy specialists, conservationists, and                            biotechnologists).  The Congress will host sessions on a variety                                                                                                of topics, several of which will be devoted to the main themes                  of: 1) Evolution in Perspective: Biodiversity, Conservation,                    Biotechnology, and Global Change; 2) Evolutionary Mechanisms and                                                                                                Processes; and 3) Systematics and Phylogenetic Reconstructions.

NSF support for the Congress will allow                  graduate students, members of under-represented groups of U.S.                  scientists, and investigators from lesser-developed countries to                                                                                                attend this important meeting.
