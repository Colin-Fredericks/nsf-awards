 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focussed on the development of a reactor                       system with semi-permeable walls that will permit both                          reaction and selective separation to occur simultaneously.                      The advantage of such a system for equilibrium-bound                            chemistries is obvious.  The research plan involves the                         development of a technique for coating the porous ceramic                       walls of a reactor with a suitable diffusion promoter,                          palladium, measurement of transport properties, and modelling                   studies of the unique reactor combined with a demonstration                     reaction of significance.                                                                                                                                       Specifically, project is aimed at developing palladium/porous                   ceramic oxide composites for the economical separation of                       hydrogen from high temperature gas mixtures.  Particular                        applications envisioned include in situ removal of hydrogen                     from reactive mixtures in which there is normally an                            equilibrium limitation on conversion.  This will be                             demonstrated in experiments in which catalytic steam reforming                  of methane will be undertaken in a tubular reactor with a                       Pd/ceramic composite wall.  In addition to the development of                   a practical means of supporting thin Pd films on porous                         substrate, and demonstrating their applications to reaction-                    separation coupling, the study will examine rigorously the                      mechanism of hydrogen transport across such films, and                          determine at what temperatures, pressures, and film                             thicknesses the process is controlled by hydrogen                               dissociation/re-association, versus interstitial diffusion of                   hydrogen atoms.",
