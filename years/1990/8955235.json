 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year program sponsored by San Jose State                        University which will provide leadership training, science                      content instruction, and hands on laboratory and                                demonstration activities to 85 teachers, grades 7-12, from                      about 30 schools in the local area.  The target group will be                   teacher-leaders in science education in the schools.  A high                    percentage of the students in these schools will not be                         college bound but will need background in the sciences in                       order to work in the local industries many of which are                         science oriented.  The schools serve minority and                               disadvantaged communities.  These teachers, after the                           program, will become Supervisors of Student Teachers and will                   carry on as mentors/advisors to the pre-service teachers so                     that what they have learned in their teacher education                          programs will be reinforced in their student teaching                           experiences.  Thus a new generation of teachers will enter                      the profession trained and experienced in-up-to date science                    content, pedagogy and hands-on activities.  The project                         teachers are also expected to serve as resource agents for                      their colleagues with the objective of having all science                       teachers eventually use current science pedagogy.       The                     National Science Foundation is providing funds in the amount                    of $401,023 for the project.  These funds are being matched by                  $178,777 from the local school district and San Jose State                      University.  This amounts to approximately 45% in matching funds.",
