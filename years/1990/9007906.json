 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1989, Dr. Robert Blumenschine, in collaboration with Tanzanian               scientists, began a long-term archaeological project at Olduvai                 Gorge, Tanzania.  The goal of the research is to survey across an               exposed paleo-landscape and to examine the distribution of faunal               and humanly derived artifactual material.  On this basis, it                    should be possible to determine how the very early humans who                   inhabited this region over 1 million years ago subsisted and were               able to survive with extremely simple technology in a difficult                 environment.  The first exploratory phase of this project met                   with great success, and Dr. Blumenschine now wishes to initiate a               much larger second phase.  However, because of disagreements                    between Tanzanian government authorities, it is very uncertain                  whether a permit will be issued to allow continuation of the                    research.  The situation requires skillful advocacy and                         negotiation by Dr. Blumenschine, and the funds provided by this                 award will allow him to travel to Tanzania and speak directly to                the relevant individuals.  It is unlikely that any other course                 of action will permit research to continue in 1990.                                                                                                             This award is necessary to facilitate continued research at one                 of the most important known archaeological sites.",
