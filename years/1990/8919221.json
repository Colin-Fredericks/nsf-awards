The                 objective of the research is to investigate the \"locus-equation\"                algorithm as a possible source of relational invariance for place               of articulation in stops.  Locus-equations- regression fits to a                set of coordinates defined by the frequency of (i) the onset of                 CV transition, and (ii) the vowel target- were shown, in                        preliminary work, to be characterized by distinctive slopes                     differentiating the stop place dimension independently of the                   vowel.  Continuation of this work cross-linguistically, and                     across a diverse subject population is planned.  Corroboration of               preliminary findings would strongly imply the availability of a                 higher order level of abstraction that could effectively code                   relational invariance for stop place categorization.  Three-                    dimensional graphic projections of formant transition onset and                 offset points, in combination with statistical linear                           discriminant function analyses, will test the notion of                         \"sufficient perceptual contrast\" as an organizational framework                 for phonemic categorization.  The significance of this research                 is to further our understanding of phonemic-level decoding of                   speech, and ultimately, to better conceptualize how the brain                   might \"spectrotopically\" represent phonemic equivalence classes.",
