 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to design a computer system aimed               at improving the writing skills of the hearing impaired whose                   writing ability lags behind that of their hearing counterparts.                 The benefit of such a system hinges on the system's ability to                  detect errors and to offer beneficial corrective advice.  The                   work will draw on work in second language acquistion and a                      linguistic comparison of American Sign Language and English as                  well as analysis of writing samples from hearing impaired                       individuals, in order to develop a taxonomy of expected errors.                 The expected errors will be added as annotated \"mal-rules\" to a                 grammar of English.  Upon parsing a sentence containing one of                  the identified errors, the system will use the annotations to                   generate a corrective response.  The user may then be queried in                order to acquire information necessary to correct the user's                    input sentence.  Finally, a correct sentence will be generated.                 In addition to the potential benefit to the hearing impaired                    population, this work will lead toward a truly intelligent                      computer aided instruction system which will require advances in                current natural language processing capabilities.  In particualr,               advances will be made in dealing will ill-formed input as well as               in identifying sufficient representations for sencence                          generation.",
