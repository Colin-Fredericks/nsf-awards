 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Social Science Education Consortium proposes to develop,                    field test, and disseminate a resource book for secondary                       social studies methods courses that emphasizes the translation                  of knowledge and methods of the social sciences into content,                   activities, and materials suitable for secondary social studies                 classrooms.  The document will be written by a collaborating                    team of social scientists, social science educators, and master                 teachers.                                                                                                                                                       Social science certification requirements vary considerably                     from state to state, and often a preservice social studies                      teacher can select a certain number of credits from a diverse                   list of social science courses to fulfill these requirements.                   As a result, few prospective social studies teachers have had                   course work in all the social science disciplines, and in any                   particular discipline a new teacher's preparation may consist                   of a single survey course.  Such courses, which are seldom                      organized specifically for teachers, often present a jumble of                  disconnected bits of information without sufficient conceptual                  organizers to make them useful or powerful analytic tools.                      Existing methods courses often emphasize generic matters such                   as the process of teaching and classroom management.  There is                  a definite need to expand methods instruction to make it more                   discipline-specific and provide for the content knowledge needs                 of new social studies teachers and the translation of this                      content into activities and methods for the classroom.  This                    book will not only address a critical need in preservice                        methods courses, but in addition, it will be a very useful in-                  service resource.                                                                                                                                               The early chapters of the resource book will be organized by                    social studies disciplines, each focusing on the power concepts                 and organizing themes of that discipline.  While an entire                      discipline certainly cannot be presented in a single chapter                    and a chapter is not intended to be a substitute for course                     work in that discipline, these chapters are designed to fill                    gaps in the preservice teachers' knowledge, make connections                    between what is learned in college social science courses and                   what will be taught in the precollegiate classroom, and                         motivate prospective teachers to delve further into each                        subject.  The later chapters in the book will have an                           interdisciplinary approach, presenting issues and problems                      requiring an integration and marshalling of the various social                  studies disciplines.                                                                                                                                            The history portion of the resource book will be funded from                    other sources.  The resource book will be continually updated                   with an annual supplement.  The SSEC has made preliminary                       contact with publishers and other sources of funding and has                    received letters of support.  The SSEC has pledged to undertake                 publication and dissemination from its own resources in the                     event that no additional outside support or publisher is                        obtained.                                                                                                                                                       The SSEC will cost share with the following contributions:                      word-processing and resource materials, $9,300 (see page 7 of                   Dr. Schott's letter of 10/10/89); 10% commitment of Dr. James                   Giese's time, $7,800, which includes salary, benefits, and                      indirect costs (see letter from Dr. Schott on 10/18/89);                        \"backstop\" position for funding the history component of the                    project, which could amount to up to $30,000;  and \"backstop\"                   position for publication of the resource book, which could                      amount to up to $87,000.",
