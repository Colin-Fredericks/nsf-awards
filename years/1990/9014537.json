 "awd_abstract_narration": "Basic hydraulic variables, such as water discharge and flow shear          stress, are derived from velocity profiles assuming that their shape is         logarithmic.  Recent studies have demonstrated that velocity profiles           in coarse bedded streams are often not logarithmic but segmented or             S-shaped.  This doctoral dissertation research will focus on the                various factors affecting the shape and spatial variation of velocity           profiles in natural streams with coarse bed material.  In this project          two sets of data will be collected on velocity profiles:  one set of            measurements from 10 natural coarse bedded streams in New York and              Quebec and the other set from a flume with a bed of coarse material in          the Hydraulics Laboratory at the State University of New York at                Buffalo.  Respectively, these two sets of measurements will permit the          elucidation of the effect of varying bed roughness on the shape and             spatial variation of velocity profiles and the examination of the               effect of variables such as channel slope that are difficult to isolate         in the field.  These two complementary sets of field and laboratory             data will make possible the more accurate estimation of water                   discharge, bed sediment entrainment, and bed sediment transport rates.                                                                                               This research will contribute to a better understanding of flow            and resistance in channels with large roughness elements.  The                  solutions to many problems in geomorphology, engineering, and                   environmental science encountered in the exploitation of surface water          resources depend upon developing more accurate flood routing models and         sediment transport models.  The project also will provide an excellent          opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to develop                independent research skills.",
