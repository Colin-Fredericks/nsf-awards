 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal consists of eight distinct projects which are both                 theoretical and applied. It is expected that the result of this                 work will be further contributions in the areas of theoretical                  econometrics, financial markets and regional economic                           forecasting.                                                                                                                                                    One of the most important recent breakthroughs in the field of                  econometrics was in the development of Autoregressive                           Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) models. The first six                     projects to be undertaken by Professor Engle involve this type                  of analysis. The theoretical components of these analyses                       include developing more fully the statistical theory for FACTOR                 ARCH models and running experiments with such models on his                     data sets, and using spline functions to estimate ARCH models                   with non-parametric conditional distributions. The other                        projects in this area involve applying ARCH models to examine                   the volatility of the term structure of interest rates using                    longer term government securities than previous work (i.e.,                     short-term Treasury bills), daily price changes for small                       publicly-traded firms which exhibit large variances,                            forecasting in the options markets and estimating the \"price of                 risk\".                                                                                                                                                          There are two projects that are included in this grant                          involving the field of cointegration.THe first will test to see                 if there is cointegration in payrolls between broad industry                    groupings in the U.S. and individual states, using the                          traditional forecasting assumptions of share shifting and base                  multipliers. The second project is  more theoretical in nature                  and will attempt to answer some questions involving general                     estimation problems in cumulative integrative processes, such                   as consumption and income or consumption and wealth.",
