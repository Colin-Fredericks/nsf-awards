 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a sabbatical visit to the               Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, Munich, West                 Germany, for Professor J. Patrick Henry of the Institute for                    Astronomy, University of Hawaii.  He will participate in a major                German-led astronomical survey of clusters of galaxies using                    satellite based x-ray equipment (ROSAT), and then conduct followup              optical studies at the University of Hawaii.  His primary col-                  laborators will be the Institute Director, Dr. Joachim Trumper, and             others on the Institute staff.  The ROSAT satellite was to be                   launched in February, 1990.  The x-ray imaging survey of the entire             sky is expected to provide a sample of clusters of galaxies which               will be at least twice as deep as the deepest optically selected                samples.  The ROSAT sample will also have well established,                     quantifiable selection criteria and will be in a contiguous region              of the sky.  U.S. astronomers will have relatively little access to             survey data; Professor Henry is one of very few invited to                      participate in the survey phase.                                                                                                                                The study of the largest structures in the universe can tell us                 much about its history and evolution.  Galaxies are classically                 used to investigate structure in the universe.  But surveys of                  galaxies are only complete to a certain scale.  Clusters can give a             rough idea of structure on a much larger scale.  Professor Henry will           be able to relay data on position clusters to observers in Hawaii.              He and his colleagues will emphasize studies of the evolution of                cluster x-ray and optical properties, large scale structure, and                the classical magnitude redshift relation.  The depth and complete-             ness of the ROSAT sample will enable these studies to produce                   significant improvements over previous work.",
