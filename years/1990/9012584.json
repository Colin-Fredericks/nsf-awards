 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project continues empirical work concerning the dynamics of                 relative wages. Wage inequality within groups classified by                     gender, age and education increased enormously during the 1970s                 and 1980s. Relative wage differentials between groups increased                 during the 1980s, although patterns for the 1970s are mixed. The                rise in returns to a college degree since 1979 and the rose in                  overall male wage inequality since the late 1960s are two of the                most important examples of changing relative wages. Previous work               suggests that changes in age and school completion distributions                associated with the job market entry of the baby boom cohorts                   affected wages between groups. After accounting for such effects,               the data show a consistent picture of rising skill differential.                                                                                                The three major tasks involve an effort to distinguish between                  alternative explanations. The first task is to generate                         additional evidence on relative wage patterns by extending the                  previous analysis to include females, male/female differentials,                to decompose changes into permanent and temporary components, and               to attempt to identify those skills that have become more                       valuable. A second major task is to examine the effects on wage                 inequality of generalized and sector-specific demand shifts. The                third major task includes an extension from wages per se to the                 interaction between wages and labor force participation. The                    familiar trends towards decreased participation of men and                      increased participation of women are coincident with wage changes               that support traditional notions of positively inclined labor                   supply functions. The analysis will be based on a supply and                    demand framework. Several major data sets will be used in the                   various subparts of the study - the Current Population Survey,                  the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics and the National                            Longitudinal Survey of Youth.",
