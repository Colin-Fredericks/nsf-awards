 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collection of modern echinoderms in the Los Angeles                    County Museum of Natural History comprises more than 30,000 lots,               and ranks as the third largest collection of echinoderms in the                 U.S.  The collection has grown rapidly over the past ten years by               absorbing the large collection in the Allan Hancock Foundation                  of the University of Southern California, as well as several                    smaller orphaned collections.  The Los Angeles County Museum's                  collection is the most important research resource in the western               U.S. for echinoderm specialists and marine biologists using this                taxonomic group in studies of ecology and environmental                         management.  Dr. Gordon Hendler, Curator of Echinoderms, proposes               extensive curatorial improvements to the collection, including                  installation of a high density storage system and integration and               reorganization of the newly acquired orphaned collections.                           The proposed curatorial activities will increase the                       availability and utilization of these important systematic                      reference collections.  Systematists, ecologists, and                           evolutionary biologists are increasingly dependent on access to                 collections such as this.  The continued growth and proper                      curation of collections in natural history museums will yield                   important research dividends in the study of biological                         diversity.",
