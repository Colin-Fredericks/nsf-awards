 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to modernize the mechanics                       laboratory to a level beyond that normally encountered in an                    undergraduate teaching environment.  This has been accomplished                 through the acquisition of a state-of-the-art testing machine and               accessories.  This apparatus is interfaced with a microcomputer for             automatic data collection and analysis.  The study of materials                 properties is enhanced by permitting accurate determination of the              stress-strain behavior of materials and associated properties such              as Poisson's ratio and the modulus of elasticity.  The laboratory's             capability is expanded in a broad range of experimental areas such              as fatigue, creep, and fracture mechanics.  This equipment greatly              increases the students' exposure to modern experimental techniques              and better prepares them for graduate studies and professional                  work.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                   principal investigator's institution.",
