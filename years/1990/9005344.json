 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sedimentary and volcaniclastic rocks of the Oligocene Creede                Formation will be investigated in order to assess the range and                 evolution of intracaldera sedimentary environments, and the                     controls on diagenesis and alteration in an intracaldera setting.               The Creede Formation was chosen for this study because of the                   extensive exposures of relatively underformed intracaldera                      sedimentary rocks associated with a large resurgent caldera, the                well known volcanic stratigraphy and chronology of the Creede area,             and the opportunity to test and contribute to the well-studied                  Creede hydrothermal model.  In contrast to previous studies of                  intracaldera sedimentary rocks, this study will focus on evaluating             the basin-wide field relationships among sedimentary, primary                   pyroclastic, and hydrothermal rocks, as well as authigenic mineral              chemistry and distribution.  These data will be used to:  1)                    develop an understanding of depositional processes and sediment                 distribution patterns occurring in an intracaldera basin; and 2)                assess the relative controls of the depositional environment,                   hydrothermal activity, organic carbon distribution, and basin                   hydrology on the diagenesis of the volcaniclastic rocks.  The                   results of this project will provide a working model for                        sedimentary deposition and diagenesis in an intracaldera setting,               as well as allow an assessment of the role the Creede Formation                 sediments may have played in the evolution of the Creed                         hydrothermal system.  In general, the results will contribute to                our understanding of caldera evolution and hydrothermal systems                 associated with calderas, and provide valuable baseline data for                evaluation of other intracaldera sedimentary sequences.",
