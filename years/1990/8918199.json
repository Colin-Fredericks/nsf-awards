 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed pilot project is to gain greater                  insight into the relationship between various racial                            compositions and their psychological effects upon whites and                    blacks.  Such a study of the psychological factors thought to                   contribute to interracial tensions that result in the                           withdrawal of whites from integrated settings would have its                    greatest implications for issues bearing on school integration.                 The investigator feels that results from this study could be                    used as a guide in composing a variety of integrated work and                   therapeutic groups.  By varying the racial composition of a                     series of small groups, the investigator will attempt to                        determine the following:                                                                                                                                           1) What effect does the racial composition of a group have                   on the perceived levels of control and comfort for blacks and                   whites?                                                                                                                                                            2) Do whites and blacks experience the effects of varying                    racial compositions at different or similar racial                              configurations?                                                                                                                                                 The investigator plans to use the results in the pilot study to                 strengthen the quality of an anticipated full MRI proposal.",
