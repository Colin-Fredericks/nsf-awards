 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Children's Museum will create a 3,000 square foot natural          science exhibition, \"Animals Eat\", that will provide interactive                experiences that assist children in formulating appropriate concepts of         living things.  The exhibition and accompanying educational materials           will be targeted at children aged 7-10 years old, and will utilize              recent research on how children conceptualize biological phenomena.  It         will focus on familiar animals and on the processes of eating because           many observable aspects of the natural world are mediated by the quest          for food.                                                                                                                                                       The exhibit, capitalizing on existing living collections, will be               developed and designed using a variety of interview techniques and              formative testing of exhibit prototypes to insure that the content is           both appropriate for children and that the exhibition results in                successful learning experiences.  A broad range of exhibition                   techniques, including museum objects, interactive units, games, and             video will be used.  The exhibition will reach more than a million              visitors during its five year life.  \"Animals Eat\"  will be the first           in a series of new core exhibitions at the museum.  NSF's award will be         supported by more than $320,000 in cost sharing.",
