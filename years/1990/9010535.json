 "awd_abstract_narration": "People are often faced with decisions involving uncertain outcomes.             Rather than making judgments in accord with probability theory,                 past research suggests that people use a limited number of                      heuristics.  There has been little research, however, on the                    process by which heuristics are selected.  This proposal for a                  Research Planning Grant examines the question of when each                      heuristic is used.                                                                                                                                              The principal investigator proposes that people have multiple                   heuristics, but that one occupies a default position.  The plan is              to development an experimental methodology for measuring heuristic              use in probability judgment.  This methodology will be used to                  examine factors which influence heuristic selection.  The project               will identify conditions which can improve the accuracy of                      probability estimation and enhance the quality of decisions                     involving uncertainty.",
