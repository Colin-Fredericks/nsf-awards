 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical and empirical studies of reproductive success and                   life-history evolution primarily focus on the regulation of                     female performance.  This emphasis is justifiable only if it can                be assumed that the determinants of male reproductive success are               like those regulating female reproductive success.  Yet, in                     virtually all multicellular organisms, there is substantial                     gender-specific variation in reproductive behavior, which leads                 to fundamental differences in the determinants of male and female               reproductive success.  One of the simplest and most phyletically                widespread gender-specific differences in reproductive behavior                 is the retention of female gametes within the parent until some                 time after fertilization, and the broadcasting (or transfer by                  pollinators) of male gametes into air or water.  This                           reproductive dichotomy potentially enhances levels of (1)                       intermale gametic competition, (2) gender-specific variance in                  pre-fertilization reproductive success, and (3) diversity of                    paternity within sibling relationships.  Consequently, this sort                of gender-specific variation in reproductive pattern potentially                affects the intensity of sexual selection levels of gene flow,                  the structure of breeding systems, and the evolution of social                  behaviors.  At present, virtually nothing is known about the                    determinants of male versus female reproductive success for any                 non-motile, aquatic invertebrate. This research will                            make direct field measurements of individual male (and,                         necessarily, female) reproductive success and dispersal in the                  colonial hydrozoan, Hydractinia milleri.  DNA sequence analysis                 (i.e., DNA fingerprinting) to determine parent-offspring                        relationships of brooded larvae and adults that are members of,                 and recruit into, mapped populations over a three-year period.                  Data obtained from a combination of field and laboratory                        manipulations will allow an assessment of how colony density,                   size and proximity affect the relationship among reproductive                   investment, fertilization success, and reproductive success.",
