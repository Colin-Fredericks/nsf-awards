 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college is developing a course in molecular biology to provide              women students with a modern, rigorous, and integrated biology                  curriculum. Laboratories are designed to develop critical thinking and          data analysis skills which directly involve students in state-of-the-           art molecular methods. The department is purchasing an ultracentrifuge,         high speed centrifuge and rotors, microfuges, DNA sequencing equipment,         gel blotting units, slab gel dryer, and hybridization apparatus. This           makes possible the isolation and characterization of macromolecules,            cloning and sequencing of DNA fragments, and nucleic acid and protein           blotting. These techniques are being incorporated into project-                 oriented laboratories in the new Molecular Biology course. Fundamental          knowledge and skills on protein and nucleic acid analysis which                 students have acquired in their core courses are being applied and              enhanced through molecular biology projects which emphasize isolation           and characterization of functional domains of DNA and proteins. The             college is contributing 104% of the award for this project.",
