 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer acquired through this project was a Silicon Graphics               4D/25G graphics workstation with 12 MB of memory and two 380 MB                 hard disk drives.  The graphics and calculational capabilities of               the computer are being used to support two biochemistry courses,                a course in computational chemistry, and the senior thesis                      program.                                                                                                                                                        The workstation filled a gap that existed between what the                      chemistry undergraduates were taught and modern chemical                        research.  The rapid growth of information regarding molecular                  structure in biochemistry has given rise to the need for a more                 effective method of representing large molecules in three                       dimensions than was available at the institution.  The graphics                 workstation provided such a method.  Using available software                   packages, students are introduced to the intricacies of                         macromolecular structure throughout the one year biochemistry                   course.                                                                                                                                                         An additional need arose from the lack of instruction that                      undergraduates received in computational chemistry.  The                        acquisition of the workstation permitted the development of a                   course designed to teach the theory and practice of molecular                   calculations.  To teach such a course effectively, the Chemistry                Department required a more powerful computer than was available.                The Silicon Graphics workstation provided not only the necessary                processing power, but also the advantage of graphics capabilities               to assist in the presentation and interpretation of results from                sample calculations.                                                                                                                                            The senior thesis program also made extensive use of the graphics               workstation.  Student projects that were affected included site-                directed mutagenesis studies, enzyme inhibitor design and                       mathematical modelling of the relationship between structure and                mutagenicity.                                                                                                                                                   The institution contributed in an amount slightly in excessof the               NSF funds.",
