 "awd_abstract_narration": "The equipment purchased through this project was for a laboratory               program associated with a course designed for students who are                  not majoring in the natural sciences.  The course, \"Chemistry and               Crime:  From Sherlock Holmes to Modern Forensic Science\", is a                  one semester course designed to teach the fundamentals of                       forensic science ranging from atomic absorption spectra and paint               analysis to infrared spectroscopy and drug analysis to                          electrophoresis and DNA analysis.                                                                                                                               The funds were used to purchase equipment for six experiments.                  (1) Gas chromatography is being used to determine the                           concentration of alcohol in blood, to determine the identity of                 accelerants used in arson and to characterize a sample containing               a mixture of drugs.  (2) High pressure liquid chromatography is                 being used to separate and identify drugs in suspect samples.                   (3) The drugs present in samples separated by high pressure                     liquid chromatography are being identified by infrared                          spectroscopy.  (4) DNA profiles for suspect identification are                  being obtained by using restriction enzymes and electrophoresis                 equipment and power supplies.  (5) Visible spectrometers are                    being employed for determining the blood and breath levels of                   alcohol.  These experiment have supplemented a series of                        experiments previously in place, on a limited basis, with                       phenomenal success.  The various pieces of equipment acquired for               the forensic science laboratory are also used in the organic and                biochemistry laboratories.  A \"crime lab\" equipped so that the                  above experiments can be conducted has created an environment to                stimulate the interest of the traditional nonscience majors.  It                has made the study of chemistry more interesting, more                          challenging and more rewarding.                                                                                                                                 The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
