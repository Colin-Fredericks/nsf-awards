 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work is directed toward understanding the kinetics and                     mechanisms of heterogeneous selective oxidation of cycle                        alkenes and of oxygen-addition reactions and selective                          oxidation of linear alkenes on selected metal surfaces,                         principally silver.  It includes the identification of                          reaction products and determination of reaction selectivity                     under oxygen-rich and oxygen-lean conditions; the                               determination of the rate-determining step in the formation of                  each product, and of the activation energy and preexponential                   factor for each such steps; the identification of reaction                      intermediates, and the clarification of the details of the                      elementary bond-breaking and bond-forming processes leading                     from reactant to product.  The study employs a combination of                   ultrahigh-vacuum techniques including temperature-programmed                    reaction spectroscopy and vibrational spectroscopy; in some                     cases, synchrotron radiation techniques are used to assist in                   the determination of adsorbate geometries.                                                                                                                      The systems under study form the basis of a number of                           commodity and specialty chemical processes in which                             selectivity and minimization of deleterious byproducts are                      crucial to commercial success.  This work should provide                        valuable guidance for design improvements and control in these                  processes.",
