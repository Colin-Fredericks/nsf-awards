 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will allow a graduate student                in cultural anthropology to study a religious cult community in                 Northern California.  Using ethnographic methods of participant                 observation and structured interviewing, the student investigator               will study how the religious community survives and adapts to its               social environment through analysis of the tension between the                  social structure of the group and the expressive, affective                     relationships between individuals in the community.                                                                                                             This research is important because so-called \"new religions\" are                a significant part of modern American society.  Increased                       understanding of how such religious communities survive and adapt               to their socio-cultural environment can help the social groups                  they deal with and policy-makers interact with them more                        successfully.",
