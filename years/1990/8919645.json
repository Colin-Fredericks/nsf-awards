 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of high altitude adaptation have had a long and                    productive history in physical anthropology in order to                         understand the mechanisms by which human populations adapt to                   environmental stress.  Yet, our understanding of the extent to                  which adaptation has been achieved and the processes involved                   remains fragmentary.  The overall purpose of this research                      project is to determine whether populations longer resident at                  high altitude are better adapted than shorter resident groups as                a result of their superior abilities to transport and/or extract                oxygen from the blood.  Because birth weights are reduced at high               altitude and decreased birth weight is associated with increased                infant mortality, an important criterion for assessing adaptation               is the preservation of birth weight values associated with low                  mortality risk.  Given the likelihood that persons have lived at                high altitude for exceedingly short and long periods of time in                 Colorado and Tibet respectively, this project will study groups                 at the two locales.  The study will examine the relationship                    between altitude and birth weight, birth weight and gestational                 age, and the causes of neonatal deaths.  In addition, studies of                maternal arterial oxygen content, uterine blood flow, and uterine               oxygen delivery are proposed for the two sites.  Study methods                  include the recording and comparison of birth weight, gestational               age and other data obtained from birth and death certificates on                approximately 110,000 births in Colorado and from approximately                 8000 births in Tibet.  The proposed study will be able to                       determine whether or not Tibetans are protected from altitude-                  associated fetal growth retardation and to identify the                         components of maternal oxygen transport involved.",
