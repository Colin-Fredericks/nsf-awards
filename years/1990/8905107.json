 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed here concerns sediment-hosted micron                 gold (SHMG) deposits, which are the largest fossil hydrothermal                 systems in the Great Basin (Fig. 1) and the most important                      sources of gold in the U.S.  The project will focus on                          determination of:                                                                    1) deposit-scale zoning,  which could provide information on                    the source of SHMG mineralizing fluids, as well as the                          temperature, pressure and crustal depth at which they                           formed.                                                                         2) the age of these deposits, which will clarify their                          relation to both magmatic heat and water, and the tectonic                      evolution of the Great Basin.                                              Most of the study will be carried out on the newly discovered                   Post SHMG deposit, which extends to depths of over 2500 ft. and                 contains large volumes of ore that have not been overprinted by                 weathering and oxidation.  Zoning studies will include                          mineralogical, fluid inclusion and stable isotopic measurements.                Radiometric age measurements will use an experimental evacuated                 quartz tube/total degassing 40Ar-39Ar method to analyse less 1 mg               of alteration mineral separates and these ages will be checked by               conventional 40Ar-39Ar age determinations on igneous and                        alteration minerals in pre- and post-ore dikes, which bracket                   mineralization at Post.  Our results could yield a depth-zoning                 classification for SHMG deposits, which could be used both in                   exploration and in regional tectonic studies.",
