 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mid-Ordovician/Early Silurian land plant spores can                        contribute to the resolution of two important problems.  Land                   plant spores provide the only entrance into terrestrial and fresh               H2O environments in this interval of Phanerozoic time.  The                     research described in this proposal is the first to attempt to                  establish a Late Ordovician/Early Silurian nonmarine                            biostratigraphy and phytogeography.                                                  Throughout the post-Silurian Phanerozoic, land plant                       spores/pollen have proved vital in stratigraphic zonation of                    nonmarine and shallow-water, nearshore marine rocks.  Only local                attempts have been made to extend spore biostratigraphy into the                Late Silurian, and none effectively into the pre-Late Silurian.                 It now appears possible to establish a continuous biostratigraphy               for shallow-water nearshore marine and nonmarine rocks from the                 mid-Ordovician to the Devonian.                                                      This will be the first zonation possible for nonmarine                     rocks; it will also provide the only precise means of correlating               shallow-water, nearshore, Late Ordovician-Silurian strata since                 marine invertebrates/organic microfossils are absent or not                     presently biostratigraphically useful in the nearshore facies.                       Equally important is the fact that the spore-producing                     plants represent a hitherto unknown group of land plants that                   placed an important source of vegetation into continental                       habitats well before the traditional Early Devonian benchmark                   commonly considered to mark the major, initial radiation of the                 tracheophytes.",
