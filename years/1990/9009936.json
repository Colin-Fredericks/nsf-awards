 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interactive proof system consists of two players, an \"infinitely\"            powerful prover and a probabilistic time-bounded verifier.  The prover          tries to convince the verifier of the validity of some statement.               However, the verifier does not trust the prover and will only accept            if the prover manages to convince the verifier of the validity of the           statement.  The prover and the verifier have a conversation with the            verifier using random coins to ask questions to the prover until the            verifier is or is not convinced of the validity of the statement.                                                                                               This project will examine the complexity of these interactive proof             systems and the techniques used in the recent results showing every             problem solvable in a reasonable amount of space has such a proof               system.  The new ideas, based on looking at certain hard problems with          a simple algebraic characterization, may prove useful in tackling some          of the other hard questions in structural complexity theory.                                                                                                    Using certain cryptographic assumption, one can show every interactive          proof system has an equivalent \"zero-knowledge\" proof system, i.e. the          verifier receives no information from the protocol other than whether           the statement was valid.  This project will try to determine whether            such a theorem is true without any cryptographic assumptions.  Perhaps          one could use the new ideas for interactive proofs using certain                \"hard\" functions whose hardness do not depend on unknown assumptions.                                                                                           This project will also study how much more time is needed for a                 computer with access to random coins to be more powerful than a                 similar computer with less time.  Standard techniques will not help to          solve this problem but perhaps the techniques used for interactive              proof systems may also prove this question.                                                                                                                     This project will also look at some complexity issues of multiple-              prover interactive proof systems where there are two or more provers            who can not communicate among themselves.  While the complexity of              multiple-prover interactive proof systems is known, this project will           look at the complexity of such proof systems with a constant number of          rounds of communication been the provers and the verifier and also              various applications of the complexity of these proof systems.",
