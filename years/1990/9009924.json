 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrochemical micromachining (EMM) is becoming increasingly                                                                                                   important in the processing of high-precision metallic parts                    and in device fabrication in the microelectronics industry.                     However, the complicated interactions of transport phenomena,                                                                                                   electric current distribution, and tool and work piece                          geometry have made engineering advances difficult.  Usually,                    the choice of operating parameters is made empirically, based                                                                                                   primarily on trial and error experimental approaches.                                                                                                           A fundamental theoretical study of the electrochemical                          micomatchining process is proposed.  The analysis will employ                                                                                                   the finite element method to simultaneously calculate mass                      transport, fluid flow, potential, and geometrical changes as a                                                                                                  self-consistent, mathematical moving boundary problem.  Past                    modeling approaches of similar electrochemical systems have                     generally considered only those cases where fluid flow is                       unimportant or have ignored the interaction of changing                         geometry on mass transport in the system.                                                                                                                       The potential impact of this work is great.  A prior                            calculations can be used as a cost-effective test bed to asses                                                                                                  process changes and to determine optimal process parameters,                    such as current density, electrolyte flow rate, and tool                        shape.  This work will advance the fundamental understanding                    of EMM and will enable rapid advances of micromachining                         techniques for many applications.",
