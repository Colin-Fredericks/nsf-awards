 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide supplementary support to enable Dr. Marc                Lamphier of Harvard University to conduct collaborative research                for 21 months with Dr. Tadatsugu Taniguchi of the Institute of                  Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.  They                  will study the genetic regulations of the beta-interferon response.                                                                                             Interferons are cytokines which induce the expression of a number               of genes involved in the defense against viral and bacterial                    infections, inhibitions of tumor growth, modulation of the immune               response, and possibly in the regulation of normal growth and                   development.  The human beta-interferon gene was cloned by                      Dr. Taniguchi in 1979, and initially overexpressed in E. coli in                a collaboration between Taniguchi and the lab at Harvard with which             Lamphier is now affiliated.  Two mammalian DNA-binding proteins                 (IRF-1 and IRF-2) which recognize a common regulatory element in                the human beta-interferon promotor have recently been identified                and cloned.  The present effort will investigate the mechanism by               which these two factors coordinate gene regulation, and use the                 factors to try to identify part of the network of genes which                   moderate the cellular response to beta-interferon.",
