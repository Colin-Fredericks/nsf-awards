Since their                      Master's program was designed with the objective of retraining                  mainly professionals of non-computer science backgrounds, and the               Bachelor's program lacks courses in the broad sub-disciplines of                the computing field, they will restructure both programs so that                (a) the undergraduate program will meet the curriculum guidelines               of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), (b) any overlap               in programs' course contents will be eliminated, and (c) their                  Master's program graduates can smoothly enroll into Doctorate's                 programs of partner universities and continue their computer                    science education when so desired.                                                   2)  Establish a facility for student and faculty research in               computer science.                                                                    3)  Work on establishing an independent Computer and                       Information Sciences Department. They will accomplish their                     objectives by:                                                                       1)  Restructuring the undergraduate program to meet ACM's                  computer science curriculum recommendations that they offer new                 courses across the sub-disciplines of the field with emphasis on                problem solving in order for their senior students to perform at                a level that will meet national standard on the COSC Graduate                   Record Examination (GRE).                                                            2)  Setting up partnerships with at least two Doctorate                    program offering universities in order to provided the graduates                of the Master's program with the opportunity to pursue further                  graduate studies leading to Ph.D degrees.                                            3)  Increasing the number of faculty with terminal degrees                 and/or strong research and development experience in computer                   science areas.                                                                      4)  Establishing a Center for Research in Distributed                       Computing (CeRDIC) for consolidating the department's future,                   private and government, sponsored research activities in                        distributed computing.",
