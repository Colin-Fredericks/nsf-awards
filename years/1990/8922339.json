 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of main-group chemistry and                    deals with the chemistry of carbon-boron compounds with cage                    structures. Such compounds are of considerable interest to                      theoreticians because of their unusual electronic structures,                   but are also of considerable practical interest as starting                     materials for the synthesis of new ceramics and of new                          compounds for boron-based in vivo imaging.                                                                                                                      The chemistry of cage compounds of carbon and boron                             (carboranes) will be studied and will include: (a) cage opening                 of carboranes with fluoride ion, (b) exploration of the                         influence of a wide variety of attached groups on the                           pliability and rearrangements of substituted carborane systems                  with the expectation that mechanistic details of cage                           rearrangements will emerge, (c) equilibration studies involving                 isomeric substituted carboranes with the anticipation that cage                 stabilizing and destabilizing influences of various                             substituents can be assessed, (d) a study of net front-side                     cage displacement reactions, (e) the synthesis of new                           substituted carboranes that offer possibilities of                              substantially affecting cage bonding, and (f) the synthesis of                  new carborane systems.",
