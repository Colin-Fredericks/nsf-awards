 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to design, implement and evaluate a            model for primary mathematics instruction (grades K-3) to enhance               student understanding and support teacher change in predominantly               minority public schools.  The \"pedagogical content knowledge,\"                  mathematical content knowledge, and beliefs of teachers of minority             children will be addressed in summer inservice programs designed to             reflect a grade-related focus.  The summer component will compel the            teachers to:  investigate the premise that mathematics instruction              should be based on a child's existing knowledge, reflect on their               perception of mathematics and mathematical instruction, focus on the            influence of affective behavior in instruction, directly address equity         issues, examine and develop instructional activities to foster                  mathematical understanding and problem solving, and experience                  organizing and conducting meaningful mathematics instruction with a             small group of minority children.  Project research will be in terms of         longitudinal effect on students' mathematical understandings, teachers'         instructional approaches, classroom practices, and teacher beliefs.             This will include an on-going process evaluation of the implementation          of the summer inservice goals and a multi-year impact evaluation of the         inservice effects in terms of student learning and teacher beliefs and          practices.
