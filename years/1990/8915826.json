 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the manner in which glycyl-tRNA synthetase               recognizes and charges glycine-specific tRNA and makes an                       essential contribution to the process of protein biosynthesis.                  The work will employ site-specific labeling reagents which are                  chemical analogs of the normal substrates, tRNA and ATP, to                     locate domains within the enzyme essential to catalysis and to                  its biological function.  The proposed experiments are aimed at                 obtaining amino acid sequences of peptide segments involved                     directly and in proximity to the enzyme's catalytic site.  In                   these experiments, emphasis will be given to the dissimilar alpha               and beta subunits comprising the enzyme.  An effort will be made                to determine how these subunits are arranged in the native                      enzyme, how they form or constrain its catalytic site, and how                  they cooperate in recognizing glycine-specific tRNA and reject                  non-cognate tRNA.  In order to investigate the generality of                    these findings, it is proposed that some parallel experiments                   with phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase be conducted.  This enzyme is                 the only other synthetase which contains dissimilar subunits.                   This work will provide important information regarding the                      molecular mechanism of protein-RNA recognition and the manner in                which the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are able to minimize error                 in the expression of genetic information in DNA.",
