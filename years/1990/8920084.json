 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synthetic Organic Program is funding the research of Dr.                    William S. Johnson of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford                   University.  Dr. Johnson will continue his world renowned                       studies on biomimetic polyene cyclization.  The proposed work                   focuses on the use of cation-stabilizing (C-S) auxilliaries to                  enhance cyclization and also on the use of monoclonal antibody                  catalysis.                                                                                                                                                      The research will employ various C-S groups to explore                          synthetic routes to pentacyclic triterpenoids.  Further, the                    C-S effect has led to to a proposed mechanism for the action of                 oxidosqualene cyclases involving stabilization of the                           transition states by ion pairing with external point charges                    delivered by the enzyme.  Synthesis will lead to partially                      cyclized substrates with appropriately located positive centers                 and these compounds will be tested as possible transition state                 analog inhibitors.  The initial studies of monoclonal antibody                  catalysis will focus on the design and synthesis of haptens                     which resemble cyclization products.",
