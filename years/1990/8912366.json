 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Model\" oxides are nonporous, submicron-sized particles with                    regular shapes (spheres or cubes) prepared by metal                             evaporation.  They are low-surface-area analogs to the high-                    surface-area oxides used as heterogeneous catalysts or                          catalyst supports.  The simpler geometry of the model oxide                     powders permits better characterization of bulk and surface                     structures.  In this work, the structure and catalytic                          reactivity of model alumina powders are compared to those of                    the high-surface-area alumina used industrially.  Since                         defects are thought responsible for much of the activity in                     disordered alumina, they will be introduced into the model                      alumina (using neutron bombardment and other techniques)  and                   their effects on catalytic activity will be observed.  A                        series of model oxides (alumina, silica, titania) are also                      used as supports for other dispersed phases (oxides and                         sulfides) and the structures of the overlayers, the mechanisms                  of solid-solid wetting, and the natures of the ceramic-ceramic                  interfaces are studied.  An attempt is also made to extend the                  metal evaporation techniques  to the preparation of powders of                  mixed oxides, initially of aluminum titanate.                                                                                                                   This work provides fundamental information that can be used in                  the design and engineering of ceramic materials and                             heterogeneous catalysts.  It also elaborates the effects of                     atomic-scale defects on catalytic activity and ceramic                          bonding.  Synthesis of new ceramic materials is also a                          possible result of this work.",
