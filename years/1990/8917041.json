 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue CALCRUST (California                 Consortium for Crustal Studies) activities for one year.                        CALCRUST is a regional consortium of earth scientists from                      California with a common interest in crustal structure and                      evolution.  CALCRUST provides a common focus for a multifaceted,                crustal-studies team with expertise ranging from geology to                     reflection seismology and seismic data processing.                                                                                                                   The CALCRUST scientific program is addressing important                    questions regarding continental accretionary tectonics, the                     mechanics of crustal extension and compression, modes of                        deformation in the seismogenic regions of southwestern U.S., the                structure of batholiths, and basement tectonics of the                          petroliferous basins of coastal California.   An important focus                is on low-angle structures -- their geometry and continuity in                  the subsurface.  CALCRUST seeks to extend to the third dimension                our reasonably complete understanding of the surface geology, and               begin the process of establishing relationships between the                     apparent diversity of geologic terranes in southwestern U.S.                                                                                                         During the period of this award, the focus will be on                      completing the analysis and interpretation of data in hand, both                the reprocessing of donated industry data and data gathered under               CALCRUST contract, and the publication of results.",
