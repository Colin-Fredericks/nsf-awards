 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Taparowsky's long term goal is to understand the biochemical                pathways through which programs of cell proliferation,                          differentiation and transformation are regulated during                         development. As a first step toward this goal, she has                          investigated how the expression of an activated ras oncogene                    disrupts the differentiation of cultured myoblasts and have                     correlated the inability of ras cells to differentiate with the                 down-regulation of the myogenic regulatory gene, MyoD1.                         Interestingly, she has demonstrated that other inhibitors of                    myogenesis in culture, such as FGF and TGF-beta, also negatively                affect transcription of the MyoD1 gene. To investigate the                      intracellular mechanisms that mediate the myogenic program, she                 proposes to examine if changes in phosphatidylinositol metabolism               or protein kinase C activity are associated with ras expression                 or TGF-beta or FGF treatment in myoblasts. In addition, she has                 cloned the rat MyoD1 gene and propose to use this gene to map the               cis-acting elements that regulate the transcription of the MyoD1                gene in normal and differentiation defective myoblasts.                         %%%                                                                             The development of embryonic cells into distinct cell types,                    such as muscle cells, requires an as yet not well understood                    balance between cell division and differentiation. This project                 investigates at the molecular level the interaction of a gene                   involved in transformation to a state characterized by a high                   rate of cell division and a gene that targets a cell to                         differentiate into muscle cells.",
