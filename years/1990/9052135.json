The ever                       increasing amount of automated test equipment in the production                 environment requires an appropriate education of those charged with             the test responsibilities.  This requires the integration of basic              principles with laboratory reinforcement.                                                                                                                       The area of focus is a three term sequence of courses with both                 classroom and laboratory experience.  This sequence is an                       alternative to an independent study senior project where the                    student the student develops his own project and implements the                 design.  This option is directed at areas recommended by industry               and involves equipment utilizing both GPIB and VIX automated test               equipment having all the functions necessary to teach the                       principles and practice of Test Engineering.
