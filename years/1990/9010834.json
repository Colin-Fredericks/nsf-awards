 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this project are to examine and develop new                   observation and information extraction techniques for synthetic aperture        radar (SAR) images of terrain.  These techniques extract surface                roughness information on a spatial scale on the order of the radar              illumination wavelength using diversity measurements of speckle patterns        arising in the imaging of the observed surface, where diversity can be          in the form of frequency, position, or polarization diversity.  Hence,          rather than viewing speckle as a corrupting noise in the SAR imaging            process, image speckle is used as a carrier of information on the imaged        surface.  These techniques have the potential of providing surface              roughness characteristics on a much smaller scale than the typical              spatial resolution cell of SAR imagery, greatly enhancing the geological        measurement capabilities of SAR terrain images - one of the major uses          of SAR.                                                                                                                                                         These techniques involve the extension of optical speckle metrology             techniques for determining the surface roughness characteristics of             surfaces illuminated by laser light.  This involves extending optical           speckle models to SAR imaging at microwave frequencies and extending            speckle metrology techniques to provide useful new surface information          under the constraints of airborne and spaceborne SAR platforms.  The            resulting techniques are tested using computer modeling and real SAR            measurements.",
