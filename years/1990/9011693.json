 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the fourth in a continuing series of international                      conferences on contemporary process control.  The conference                    will enjoin engineers and scientists from universities and                      industry to provide a forum for assessing both the current                      status and future needs and challenges in the field of process                  control.  The first three CPC conferences were very successful                  in establishing such a constructive dialogue between control                    theoreticians and industrial practitioners.                                                                                                                     The theme of the proposed conference is:  Future Needs and                      Challenges in Process Control.  The specific goals of CPC IV                    are as follows:  (1) To gain an appreciation of the state of                    process control practice in each of the process industries and                  to obtain from industry a list of future needs and challenges                   for the research community.  (2) To present an overview of the                  state of the art in each of the important areas of process                      control theory and practice, in a way which is understandable                   to the non-specialist and industrial practioner.  (3) To                        provide a forum for in-depth discussion between university                      researchers and industrial practitioners on the practical                       challenges in this field and the extent to which current                        research directions are satisfying perceived needs.  (4) To                     allow the industrial practitioner a better understanding of                     the new tools available from the research community in order                    to simulate wider implementation where these are useful.  (5)                   To simulate the research community to adjust research                           directions through (a) a better understanding of perceived                      needs and challenges from the process industry and (b) a                        tutorial introduction to new intellectual concepts in other                     areas of process control research.",
