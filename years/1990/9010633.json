 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines representation in the U.S. Senate from                    three perspectives.  These are:  (1) at the level of individual                 voter decisions where new work will improve explanations of voter               choice and assess certain problems with reports of the vote in the              National Election Studies; (2) development of parallel models for the           explanation of election outcomes; and, (3) the interaction of candidate         behavior and changes in electoral coalitions over time.                                                                                                         This multi-level approach is designed to bridge the micro-macro gap of          the voting and elections literature.  Studies of voter decision making          and studies of legislative policy making have not been integrated, but          proceed at fundamentally different levels.  The focus on coalitions,            how voters join and defect from them in response to candidates, and how         changes in coalitions affect incumbent behavior in Congress, promises           to provide the needed linkage between citizens and the behavior of              their elected representatives.  By linking the micro decisions of               citizens with the macro-level policy behavior of elected officials,             this study should increase our understanding of the representative              process in the United States - -  one of the fundamental processes of           democratic governance.                                                                                                                                          The study will examine almost 100 races for the U.S. Senate over the            period 1982-1990.  Data sources include the National Election Studies,          CBS/New York Times election day exit polls, content analysis of home            state newspaper campaign coverage, and incumbent roll call scores on            various policy indices.",
