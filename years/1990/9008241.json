 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paul Rowe, an amateur archaeologist, made surface collections and               excavated archaeological materials from over 200 sites in                       southwestern Iowa.  Because of the care with which he worked and                the extensive documentation associated with these materials, they               are widely used and provide an important data base.  The                        collection includes lithics, ceramics, and both worked and                      unworked faunal remains.  The materials are currently held by                   several institutions.                                                                                                                                           With National Science Foundation support, Dr. William Green and                 his colleagues will continue their work to make these materials                 of maximum research use.  In this next phase of their project,                  the team will correlate objects with the relevant documentation                 and ascertain the specific sites from which each collection                     derives.  Detailed data will be entered into the Office of the                  State Archaeologist's files, and the objects themselves will be                 sorted by site and by material class within each site, labeled by               catalog number, and boxed in standard-size storage containers.                  They will be added to the State Artifact Repository.  One portion               of the collection is held by the Mills County Historical Museum,                and it will be surveyed to determine physical condition and the                 nature of its documentation.  Recommendations for treatment will                be developed.                                                                                                                                                   The Rowe collection is important because it can provide insight                 into prehistoric cultural development in the Midwest United                     States.  Because of storage and documentation problems, the                     collection cannot now be used efficiently.  The work by Dr. Green               and colleagues will serve to remedy this situation.",
