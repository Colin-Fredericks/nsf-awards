 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution was able to purchase an FT-               NMR spectrometer to use as a laboratory tool for the structure                  identification of organic compounds.  Most of the compounds are                 synthesized by students in one of several organic and polymer                   chemistry laboratory courses offered in the department.                                                                                                         In this project, a variety of experiments were carefully chosen                 to enable the students to gain an appreciation and understanding                of the instrument as a spectroscopic tool for structural                        analysis.  These include (a) analysis of polymer tacticity,  (b)                residual monomer and microstructural product analysis of polymers               synthesized by ring-opening and ring-closing                                    polymerizations, (c) simplification of spectra of some amides and               alcohols by use of chiral/non-chiral lanthanide shift reagents                  and by deuterium exchange of acidic protons, (d) demonstration of               rotameric transformation in amides by variable temperature NMR,                 and (e) general utility in synthetic organic chemistry.                                                                                                         The instrument has also been useful in several student research                 projects in progress at the department.  The instrument improved                the quality and effectiveness of teaching in relevant lab-                      associated courses and better prepared the students for advanced                careers in chemistry.                                                                                                                                           The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
