 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major problem in digital system design courses is finding suitable            laboratory experiences.  As the gate complexities of designs increase,          it becomes increasingly difficult to perform prototyping and hardware           testing.  The nature of digital systems is such that prototyping of a           system which is embedded in a testing or operational environment will           usually entail the use of numerous chips, even if some full- or semi-           custom chips are used.  Constructing a board and interconnecting these          chips on it using any current technology is expensive and time                  consuming, as well as requiring of students uncommon technician skills.         Poor construction practice produces unreliable, non-maintainable, and           degraded performance prototypes.                                                This project provides a low-cost,high-quality, fast prototyping                 environment to support new field (i.e. student) programmed gate array           (FPGA) chips containing thousands of gates.                                                                                                                     A two-board set (bus extender and prototype) was designed and fabricated        for use with inexpensive, easily used, and ubiquitous IBM XT/AT                 computers in a digital systems lab.  The prototype board provides the           \"glue\" needed to support the rapid interconnection and educational use          of a digital system having up to two  FPGA chips.  Once a student               designs a digital system and the FPGA chips are programmed, a thousands-        of-gates system is testable after a few hours of wire-wrapping.  The            result is a dramatically improved student prototyping process.  Sixty           boards were made available to universities nationwide for                       loan/evaluation.",
