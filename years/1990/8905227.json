 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to develop a novel new x-ray diffraction                 technique to determine the stress distribution under in-situ                    high pressure conditions corresponding to the mantle interior.                  With this technique, studies such as stress-induced preferred                   orientation and yield strength measurements of high-pressure                    minerals, which are necessary to further understand the dynamics                of the mantle, will become possible.  These measurements can be                 made either in multi-anvil high pressure apparatus or in diamond                anvil cells.  A reliable method to determine the uniaxial stress                under high pressure by measuring the anisotropic compression of                 standard materials using the new high-precision x-ray diffraction               technique will be established.  This technique will be applied to               study the stress-induced preferred orientation in beta-Mn2GeO4                  (chosen as a model system for the (Mg-Fe)SiO4 mantle olivine) as                it undergoes the polymorphic transformation from its olivine-                   phase to beta-phase under the influence of uniaxial stress.  The                PI will apply the new technique to study the changes in the yield               strength of alkali halides across the B1-B2 phase boundary, to                  look for possible superplasticity at the transition and to                      determine the elastic constants of the B2 phase.  The experiments               will be conducted in collaboration with four Japanese high-                     pressure scientists using the MAX-80 cubic-anvil high-pressure                  system stationed at the high-energy (maximum  - 140KeV)                         synchrotron radiation x-ray source at the national Laboratory for               High Energy Physics in Tsukuba, Japan.",
