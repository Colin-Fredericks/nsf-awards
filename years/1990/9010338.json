 "awd_abstract_narration": "If solar energy is to make a significant contribution to the                    national energy economy, it must displace the use of fossil                     fuels to supply process heat to the industrial sector.                          Industry generally uses high temperature steam in the range                     200-700 oC1.  Temperatures in this range can be attained with                   ease in a concentrating solar facility.  But most industrial                    users of process heat are not located in a climate of reliable                  solar flux.  It is a major challenge to efficiently store and                   deliver the high temperature thermal energy from the solar                      concentrator to the point of use.  If the high temperature                      energy available in the solar concentrator were used as the                     process heat for an endothermic reaction between gases, then                    the solar energy would be stored in the products of the                         reaction.  The gaseous products then could be transported at                    ambient temperatures in a conventional pipeline hundreds of                     kilometers to the industrial user, where energy could be                        recovered in the reverse, exothermic reaction.  Such a system                   is known as a thermochemical pipe, or chemical heat pipe.                                                                                                       This research planning grant will examine the technical and                     economic feasibility of a chemical heat pipe system.  The                       design of a reactor-receiver system that decouples the                          absorption of the solar energy from the chemical reaction of                    interest will be considered.",
