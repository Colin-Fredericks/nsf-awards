 "awd_abstract_narration": "The State University of New York, College of Environmental                      Science and Forestry continues to strengthen the research program               and support capabilities of the Adirondack Ecological Center                    (AEC).  Recent improvements have emphasized additional personnel                support, enhancement of comprehensive environmental monitoring                  programs, improvement of work and living spaces for researchers                 and students, and development of more effective description and                 documentation of the station and its associated research.                       Research program goals call for greater emphasis on integrative                 studies to investigate ecological processes on a large scale,                   with a spatial context and long-term perspective.  The                          development of a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the                    station and immediate surroundings is a key component of this                   effort.                                                                                                                                                         This project provides matching funds to purchase computer                       hardware and software which will form the core of a                             data/information management and advanced spatial analysis system,               to complement the excellent ecological research qualities of the                AEC.  These qualities include a strategic location and a broad                  historical data base pertaining to biological, chemical and                     physical variables, dating to the 1930's.  The GIS will                         capitalize on these assets, faculty and graduate student                        strengths, and visiting scientist programs to advance synergism                 in ecological research and account for spatial variables in                     biological research.  Automation in the collection, storage,                    display, and analysis of data and information gained from past,                 current, and future research at the AEC will substantially                      advance the research, improve the management, and increase the                  utilization of the station.",
