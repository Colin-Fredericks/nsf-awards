 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many regions in the United States and the Soviet Union face                     earthquake threats.  Historically, both countries have had a                    number of devastating earthquakes, most recently the December                   1988 Armenian earthquake and the October 1989 Loma Prieta                       earthquake.  Much can be learned from US and Soviet scientists                  and engineers involved in evaluating the consequences of such                   events.  Post-disaster teams have visited each other's                          country and much valuable information has been exchanged.                       The objective of this workshop, is to extend and deepen this                    relationship and specifically to promote long-term cooperative                  research in this area.  Topics to be addressed in the workshop                  are ground mechanics (soil-structure interaction, liquefaction,                 ground failures, and landslides and mudslides; development                      of new construction materials; development and validation of                    mathematical models; and development of methods for strengthen-                 ing and retrofitting existing structures.                                                                                                                       The workshop is being organized jointly by the U.S. National                    Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the Academy of Sciences of the                    U.S.S.R. (ASUSSR).  The NAS participation is being managed by                   the NAS/National Research Council Committee on Earthquake                       Engineering and the delegation will be led by committee                         chairman George Housner of the California Institute of                          Technology.  The Soviet delegation will be chaired by Dr.                       V.N. Strakhov, Director of the ASUSSR Institute of the                          Physics of the Earth.                                                                                                                                           This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
