 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agricultural crops, which are usually planted as genetic                   monocultures, are notoriously prone to disease.  Natural plant                  populations, by contrast, are rarely as infected by disease; they               are also typically genetically variable.   Recently, biologists                 have postulated that the genetic diversity typical of natural                   populations may be a product of natural selection exerted by                    disease organisms, but few studies have tested this hypothesis.                 The investigators will examine the role of disease in maintaining               host genetic variation by comparing resistance of closely related               species in the mustard family to a rust disease.  Some of these                 mustard species have no genetic variability, whereas other                      species are genetically variable.                                                    For disease to be capable of promoting genetic variation,                  the disease must exert strong selection on its hosts; that is, it               must decrease survival and/or reproduction of the hosts, and                    resistance must be inherited.  The goals of this study are to                   determine whether these conditions are met, as well as to                       determine whether the genetically uniform species are less                      resistant to disease than the genetically variable species, and                 whether the composition of natural vegetation is different in                   places with and without this disease.",
