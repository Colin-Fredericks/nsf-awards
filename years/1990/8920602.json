 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goad of this project is the development of signal processing        algorithms that reliably detect and image targets embedded in a medium          of stationary and randomly distributed scatterers.  The major                   contribution of this work is a detailed study of the relationship               between scattering structures and the phase behavior of back-scattered          signals with respect to frequency and space.  Analytical investigations         and computer simulations are being developed for predicting the                 resultant signal features for noise and target echoes by integrating the        deterministic and statistical relationships between the signal                  wavelength, scatterer size, and scatterer spatial distribution.                 Experimental investigations are being carried out in parallel with the          analytical analysis and computer simulations.  Data collected from              various material samples with known flaws, and statistical                      characterizations of the phase and amplitude behavior over frequency and        spatial variations are used to validate theoretical predictions.  In            addition, design procedures are being examined for developing adaptive          nonlinear detectors that utilize frequency-diverse properties of the            signals.  The results of this study will identify critical signal               features for the development of enhanced signal imaging and detection           algorithms.",
