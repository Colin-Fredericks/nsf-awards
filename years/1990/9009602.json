 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to perform research on the design of management                 accounting information systems.  Accounting information is used by              large firms to support budgeting, decision-making, and performance              evaluation.  The research concerns the design of integrated systems             in which managers participate in the budgeting and decision process             with the objective of maximizing their performance measures.  This              project also includes research on models of decentralized decision-             making in which individuals attempt to learn their optimal decisions            from data generated by past decisions.  Simple individualistic                  learning mechanisms sometimes give rise to unstable interactions                among the learning adjustments of different individuals.  This                  research concerns the apparent trade-off between the simplicity of              learning mechanisms and the range of environments for which the                 learning mechanisms coverage to optimality.",
