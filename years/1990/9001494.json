NCKU will perform experimental and UMR will                                     conduct analytical studies.  The objectives                                     are:  1) mathematical formulation of load-                                      deflection of walls with coupling deformations                                  of bending, shear, axial,and bond slip, 2)                                      evaluation of stiffness reduction of walls and                                  structural systems after cracks, 3)                                             development of hysteresis models for bendings,                                  shear and axial, based on coupling behavior,                                    4) evaluation of damping coefficients at                                        various deformation stages, 5) statistical                                      studies of design parameters of reduction                                       factor, ductility and damage index, 6)                                          correlation of the analytical and experimental                                  results.
