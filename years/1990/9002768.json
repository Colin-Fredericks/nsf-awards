 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his research into                 the numerical solution of the acoustic equations that govern the                generation and propagation of noise by aircraft.  Specifically he               will study two major problem areas:  the development and                        implementation of numerical codes that can resolve the acoustic                 equations in the presence of vorticity, and the posing of                       physically correct and numerically consistent boundary conditions               for flow problems in unbounded domains.  The vorticity that is                  generated near sharp edges like the engines or the landing gear                 creates difficulties for conventional numerical codes, and so                   the principal investigator is developing a finite element code                  that obviates many of the problems associated with vorticity.                   With regard to the posing of proper boundary conditions it is                   necessary to set boundary conditions on an artificial interface,                in order to make the computations for a problem in an infinite                  domain tractable.                                                               The problem of aircraft noise during landings and takeoffs is of                growing concern to many communities and local governments.  One                 obvious solution of this problem is to design airplanes whose                   engines and exterior surfaces operate at minimal noise levels.                  As one can imagine easily this is a complicated phenomenon, and                 so mathematicians and aerodynamicists often resort to modelling                 the complex sets of equations with simpler ones, and then                       solving the approximate equations numerically.  However this can                be tricky too, since aircraft generate vorticity, which                         influences the noise pattern and which often defeats conventional               numerical schemes.  The principal investigator is working on                    numerical algorithms that can handle the vorticity and the                      unboundedness of the flow domain in a computationally efficient                 manner.",
