 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Jozef J. Bujarski for cooperative                 research with Profesor Jerzy Paszkowski of the Institute of Plant               Sciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich.  They are              collaborating in developing a process for amplifying selected gene              transcripts in plant tissues so that large amounts of particular gene           products will be produced.  Their novel approach is to use replicases           of plant RNA viruses for replication of other mRNAs.  Their goal is             to produce model systems to investigate virus replication and                   interaction of replicase with host proteins.  The proposed research             requires expertise in two different areas: the molecular biology of             plant viruses and plant tissue culture.  Dr. Bujarski is an expert in           the molecular biology of bromoviruses and the mechanisms involved in            the replication of their genomes.  The Swiss lab is a world leader in           direct gene transfer, and Dr. Paszkowski has substantial experience             in the transformation and regeneration of plants, especially tobacco.           The molecular cloning will be done primarily in the U.S. lab, and               transformation of protoplasts and regeneration of transgenic plants             will be done in Switzerland.  The joining of critical complementary             expertise will bring substantial mutual benefits to the two research            groups.                                                                                                                                                         The long term goal of this research is to understand molecular                  mechanisms of expression and function of genes in plant cells.  This            should make it possible to selectively amplify or inhibit the                   expression of desired genes in plant cells.  One of the major                   problems of expression of genes in transgenic plants is obtaining               sufficient levels of mRNA.  If this novel approach is successful as a           way to amplify messages in a bromovirus/tobacco system, it will be              of great utility for virtually all applications of transgenic plants            and basic virology research and will greatly assist the development             of virus-based tools in plant genetic engineering.",
