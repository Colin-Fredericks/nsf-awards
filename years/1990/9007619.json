This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Patrick                     S. Herendeen to Stockholm, Sweden, to work with Professor                       Else Marie Friis at the Swedish Museum of Natural History on                    \"Patterns in the Evolution of Angiosperm Secondary Xylem and                    Their Phylogenetic Significance,\" an investigation of well-                     preserved fusainized (charcoalified) fossil angiosperm wood                     from the Cretaceous (Barremian-Cenomanian) of North America and                 Europe to assess patterns of structural evolution in the                        secondary xylem of early angiosperms.  Through the mid-                         Cretaceous, angiosperms underwent their initial major                           diversification, so data from this study will provide a                         historical perspective against which to compare hypotheses of                   wood evolution based on extant taxa.  The researchers will                      use abundant material collected from eastern USA and central                    Portugal as part of an international cooperative project                        already underway to study fossil flowers and other reproductive                 structures of early angiosperms, much of which the Swedish                      Museum has sieved, cleaned, and made ready for study.                           Because preliminary results indicate that these collections                     readily provide detailed anatomical data, the proposed                          project can be completed within one year.  The principal                        investigator will examine with the SEM and quantify numerous                    anatomical features thought to be of evolutionary or ecological                 importance.  A computerized multiple entry key will facilitate                  determining of systematic affinities for these fossils.                         Attachments of reproductive structures to branches or                           infructescence axes may also assist in identifying some wood                    types.  The principal investigator will assess the significance                 of mosaic evolution among early angiosperms by comparing                        patterns of evolutionary change observed in angiosperm wood                     with those observed in fossil leaves, pollen and reproductive                   structures at the same localities.  He will distinguish                         patterns of evolutionary change from changes due to ecological                  factors by comparing data on angiosperm wood with that for                      co-occurring gymnosperm wood and other angiosperm remains.",
