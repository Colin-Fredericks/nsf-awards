 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Iozzi will conduct research in the application of                ergodic theory to the study of group actions on manifolds or more               generally on measure spaces.  In particular she will apply                      techniques from this area, as well as methods of representation                 theory and the theory of algebraic groups, to a variety of                      questions involving connected transformation groups and their                   discrete subgroups.  Examples of such questions are invariance                  phenomena for geometric structures and related issues on the                    compactification of algebraic varieties, orbit equivalence of                   actions, and the structural study of the diffeomorphism group of                a manifold.                                                                          This project involves research in ergodic theory.  Ergodic                 theory in general concerns understanding the average behavior of                systems whose dynamics is too complicated or chaotic to be                      followed in microscopic detail.  Under the heading \"dynamics\" can               be placed the modern theory of how groups of abstract                           transformations act on smooth spaces.  In this way ergodic theory               makes contact with geometry in its quest to classify flows on                   homogeneous spaces.",
