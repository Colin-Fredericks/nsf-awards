 "awd_abstract_narration": "This materials development project, the Science of Alcoholism Curriculum        for American Indians (SACAI), is designed to fill a gap in current              curricula by developing an innovative alcohol education component for           science classrooms in largely Native American schools.                                                                                                          SACAI proposes to address the need for improved instruction and science         based information about alcohol, teaching the science of alcoholism in          fourth through ninth grade science programs.                                                                                                                    SACAI will integrate the latest research findings about the role played         by genetics, biochemistry, and the interaction of these with                    environmental factors with traditional and culturally relevant                  approaches utilizing science-based experiments, statistical research and        instruction which develops critical thinking.                                                                                                                   SACAI is premised upon three important unique principles: 1) the                importance of using a science base for American Indian students in              alcohol education, 2) the necessity of including traditional cultural           elements and culturally relevant materials and approaches in this               alcohol education, and 3) the importance of integrating these                   ineffective education efforts.",
