 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in combinatorial design                   theory and graph theory of Professor Charles Lindner of Auburn                  University. The emphasis of Dr. Lindner's research will be on                   problems in small embeddings of partial graph decompositions, the               existence problem of 2-perfect decompositions of the complete                   graph into cycles, and the conjugate invariant subgroup problem                 for both orthogonal and perpendicular arrays.                                        This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
