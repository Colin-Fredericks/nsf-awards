 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the vascular systems of the body (blood and lymphatic) it is                 the smallest muscular vessels that play the greatest role in                    physiological regulation.  It has been extremely difficult in the               past to make quantitative studies of the behavior of these                      vessels because they are too small to allow the attachment of                   mechanical devices to measure their contractions.  It is possible               to measure their movement by computer image processing, but this                approach has not been exploited because of the previous high cost               of the equipment and the lack of suitable software.  Now that                   appropriate computer equipment is no longer prohibitively                       expensive, we will use a novel algorithm of our design to                       implement software that will (1) monitor diameter in several                    separate regions of a vascular tree and (2) monitor diameter                    change as a function of length along a region of a single vessel.               The algorithm we now use can be applied to vessels in isolated                  preparations that do not contain blood.  In response to our own                 needs and to requests from other groups, we have developed                      another algorithm for vessels that contain blood, and we shall                  develop a second set of programs using this algorithm.  These                   systems will advance the technical capabilities in basic research               in the fields of blood and lymphatic microcirculation.",
