 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterivorous ciliates are an important component of planktonic                 food webs.  They can consume a large proportion of bacterial                    production, and convert material that is low in essential                       lipids (bacterial biomass and detritus) into lipid-rich ciliate                 biomass.  How do consumers benefit nutritionally from these                     ciliates, and what role do they play in the biochemical                         transformation of ciliate carbon?                                                                                                                               To investigate the nature of ciliate lipids and their fate and                  importance in the marine food web Dr. Harvey and McManus will:                                                                                                  -    identify and quantify ciliate lipids, especially ones that                      may be useful as group-specific biomarkers in trophic                           studies.                                                                   -    examine sources of lipids in the ciliate diet and follow                        how ciliates assimilate and modify dietary lipids.                         -    measure the assimilation and transformation of ciliate                          lipids by one of their principal consumers, copepods.                                                                                                      This project combines biochemical measurements with feeding                     experiments.  Detailed lipid analysis of a number of ciliate                    species will first provide additional data on the ubiquity of                   the unique compounds they have already observed.  They will                     measure in detail the role of diet on lipid content and                         distribution of several representative bacterivorous ciliates.                  Finally,they will conduct in-depth feeding experiments to                       follow the incorporation and transformation of ciliate lipids                   by grazing copepods.                                                                                                                                            These results will provide substantial new information on the                   role of bacterivorous ciliates in the marine food web,                          especially their importance in copepod nutrition.",
