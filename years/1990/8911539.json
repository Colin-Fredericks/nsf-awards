 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research, Dr. Coleman is analyzing the social                           organization of research in a Japanese laboratory in the life                   sciences.  In addition to yielding a detailed description of                    everyday laboratory life, this study will devote particular                     attention to the reward structure and patterns of authority,                    cooperation and conflict among laboratory researchers,                          administration, and support staff.  Japanese researchers                        appear to work in a context of lower interorganizational                        competition and mobility than do their American counterparts;                   specific features of Japanese culture and society, among them                   the country's educational system, funding sources, and                          managerial styles, may all have an effect on these                              differences, which in turn influence creativity and the                         capacity  for interdisciplinary cooperation.  The results of                    this research should shed light on sociocultural influences                     on research approaches, and identify those aspects of                           collaborative research  between Japanese and Americans that                     require special attention in order to maximize the benefits                     of the joint research experience.",
