 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project will introduce a variety of laser                experiments in upper level chemistry and physics courses.  Laser-               based methods are at the heart of modern studies of atomic and                  molecular phenomena, and experience in this area is becoming an                 essential part of the education of undergraduate students in physics            and physical chemistry.  This project has been preceded by a three-             year program which has included faculty development, construction of            a scanning pulsed dye laser system, and introduction of a new course            on laser physics.  The project greatly improves Earlham's laboratory            capabilities by providing a large number of optical components,                 several important measuring instruments, and a tunable diode laser              subsystem.  The equipment is being used in eleven experiments                   covering topics in atomic and molecular physics, spectroscopy and               laser optics.  It is also being used by junior and senior students              in Independent Study courses.  The college will match the award with            an equal amount of funds.//",
