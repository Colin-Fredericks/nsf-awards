 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and theoretical investigations of possible                         mechanisms of  backflow of information in neurons are                           proposed.  Such retrograde flow of information is a                             crucial aspect of learning and plasticity of neural                             networks involving backpropagation.  The experimental                           preparations to be used are hippocampal slices of the rat                       brain.  Evidence of retrograde pathways of informational                        flow other than membrane electrical potentials will be                          sought.  One stimulus will be mechanical compression of                         efferent axons or axon hillocks.  Changes in synaptic                           response at the dendritic and axonal levels will be                             monitored as evidence of backpropagation.  The time                             scale of interest will be milliseconds as opposed to slower                     processes of axonal cytoplasmic flow in either direction.                       If functional plasticity is demonstrated, electron-                             microscopic examination of synapses will be made to seek                        cytoskeletal or vesicle alterations that correlate with the                     functional changes.  Theoretical models will consist of                         cytoskeletal components of actin-myosin gel, microtubular                       structure and a  viscoelastic matrix representing                               cytoplasm.  An active tension will be assumed in the                            actin-myosin gel.  Possible modes of wave propagation in                        the composite structure will be investigated.  The                              significance of the proposed research will be very                              important of correlation of biological counterparts to                          theoretical models of neural networks.",
