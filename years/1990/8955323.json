 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will assist 80 early childhood (K-2)                      teachers in four predominantly minority school districts in New                 York City. Teachers will learn how to use computer technology to                support the understanding of mathematical concepts through                      inquiry-based problem solving models. Workshops will focus on                   fractions, graphing, problem solving, geometry, variables, and                  software. Computer emphasis will be primarily on the use of Logo                to introduce mathematical ideas. Teachers will develop a set of                 modules on topics which are \"difficult to learn and teach\" in                   grades K through 2.  In the first year of the project, a series                 of academic year workshops will be followed by a 2-week summer                  institute. In the second year, extensive in-class followup is                   planned, as well as a repeat of the workshop series and the                     formation of a second cadre of teachers.                                                                                                                        Cost sharing is provided at the rate of 35% of the NSF award.",
