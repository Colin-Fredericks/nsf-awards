 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post-event investigation project to learn                             engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                    1989).                                                                                                                                                          The Loma Prieta earthquake has produced important information                   on performance of engineered structures subjected to strong                     ground shaking.  The strong-motion data generated from the                      instrumented buildings provide a unique opportunity to further                  advance the knowledge about the seismic behavior and                            resistance of buildings and to develop improved methodologies                   for their design.  Three steel and composite building                           structures have been selected for detailed studies in this                      project.  One suffered serious structural damage, another                       experienced excessive sway motion, and the third showed                         excellent performance.  Two main research tasks will be                         conducted.  The first is to perform analytical calculations                     to study the seismic response of these buildings using the                      recorded motions at their basement and to correlate the                         analytical results with the recorded responses at the upper                     levels.  For the seriously damaged building inelastic time-                     history analyses will also be carried out.  The second task                     is to develop retrofit or strengthening schemes to improve the                  seismic performance of the damaged building and the building                    experiencing excessive dynamic motion.                                                                                                                          The study will improve the understanding of seismic behavior                    of steel structures based on the performance data during a                      major earthquake.",
