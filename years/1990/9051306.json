 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the problem of preparing students to deal                with a variety of equipment and uses in a one-semester course.                  The project permitted the institution to acquire computer                       hardware, software, and interfacing equipment.  The course is                   divided into two pedagogical segments, one involving computer                   hardware, the other data manipulation and modeling.  The                        connection between the two parts is important.  The first part                  gives the students the opportunity to learn to determine hardware               requirements necessary to solve a particular problem.  The                      interfacing segment provides a significant component of hands-on                hardware experience at the chip and board level.                                                                                                                The purpose of the modeling part of the course is to teach the                  students a)how computer technologies can be applied in modern                   chemistry, and b)the various common hardware and software that                  are available to the chemist today.  The students who                           successfully complete this course have attained some expertise in               molecular modeling and are sufficiently familiar with a range of                approaches to a broad spectrum of problems so that they have the                perspective necessary to configure a system for a particular                    application or adapt an existing system to a new application.                                                                                                   The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
