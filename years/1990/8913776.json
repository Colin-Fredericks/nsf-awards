 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cities in the U.S. are faced with the problem of combined                                                                                                  sewer overflows (CSOs).  Combined sewers carry a mixture of                     municipal sewage and storm runoff.  During storm conditions,                    the capacity of such sewers (and/or the associated treatment                    plants) may be exceeded and the combined sewage must be                         released to the environment untreated.  Real-time control of                    the combined sewage conveyance system is a potential low cost                   solution to the problem.  Regulating gates and pumps can be                     manipulated to maximize storage of peak loads within the                        system to minimize the CSOs during each storm event.                                                                                                            The problem described above is the design of a control                          algorithm for a large-scale system.  The PI plans to adapt                      Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategies and develop a                         control scheme for the Metropolitan West Seattle sewage                         collection system.  The ultimate test of his control scheme                     will be on this real, full scale facility.  Specifically the                    project involves: (1) optimization of the dynamic response of                   a plant in which there are many manipulated variables and many                                                                                                  output variables, (2) forecasting of unmeasured plant                           disturbances, (3) accounting for inequality constraints on                      most output variables, and (4) incorporating plant dynamics                     that include integrator states, nonlinear characteristics, and                                                                                                  lags and time delays.",
