 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been much debate in recent years over whether countries               will tend in the long run to converge to the same level of                      productivity which can be measured in terms of per capita income.               In practice, the debate concerns the question of whether poor                   countries tend to have higher per capita income growth rates than               rich ones, or put another way: is there a tendency for poor                     countries to \"catch up\"?  The purpose of this research is to                    integrate data and growth theory to focus on the question of                    economic convergence.  This project will involve an empirical and               theoretical investigation of the causes of convergence or lack                  thereof.  The approach taken to the question of catching up                     begins by restating the question as one concerning the effects of               initial conditions on subsequent growth.  It is the contention in               this study that initial per capita income is too aggregate a                    measure of initial conditions on which to base our expectations                 of a country's subsequent growth.  By disaggregating initial                    conditions in a growth-theoretic context it is possible to                      greatly improve our understanding of why some poor countries have               grown much faster than rich countries while others have note.                   This project is important because it will provide new insights                  about the prospects for economic growth in the less developed                   countries.",
