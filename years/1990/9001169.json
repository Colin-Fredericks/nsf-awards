 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory will                 operate the R/V BERNIER during 1990 as a general oceanographic                  vessel in support of NSF-funded research projects.  The R/V                     BERIER is a 72.5 meter (254') general research vessel with                      special capabilities for geophysical research.  The ship was                    constructed in 1983 and is currently owned by the Trustees for                  Columbia University in the City of New York.  The recently                      purchased R/V BERNIER will replace the R/V CONRAD which was                     retired in 1989.  The R/V CONRAD was successfully operated and                  maintained by LDGO for over ten years.  The R/V BERNIER will                    conduct operations worldwide.                                                                                                                                   This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.",
