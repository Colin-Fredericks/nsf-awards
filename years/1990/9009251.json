 "awd_abstract_narration": "By studying some relatively complex chemical reactions and a               relatively simple neural network, the principal investigators                   hope to derive new insights into how the different parts of a                   network interact to produce rhythmic behavior.  Ultimately, the                 principal investigators seek to explain how groups of neurons                   work together to generate and modulate simple rhythmic behaviors                such as walking, chewing or breathing.                                                                                                                               The principal investigators propose to construct and study                 the properties of networks of coupled components, each of which                 is independently capable of oscillatory, bistable or other                      complex dynamical behavior.  Two classes of systems will be                     investigated:  a) inorganic chemical reactions in continuous flow               reactors coupled through mass transfer or through computer-                     controlled concentration-dependent modulation of input flows; and               b) neurons of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion grown in                   tissue culture and coupled through electronically-controlled                    artificial synapses and electronic connections.                                                                                                                      By employing a variety of different components and varying                 the nature of the connections between them, the principal                       investigators shall be able to explore questions that have not                  bee answered by studies of neural networks consisting of large                  numbers of simple, identical units.  Such issues include a) the                 relationship between emergent network properties, which depend                  primarily on the coupling between units, and network properties                 that result from the properties of individual units; b) the range               of behavior modes that can be displayed by coupled oscillator                   networks; c) how the details of the coupling influence the                      behavior of the network; and d) the role of delayed coupling in                 oscillator networks.                                                                                                                                                 The proposed experimental studies will be supplemented by                  ongoing theoretical work on both the chemical and neural systems.               While the chemical systems are better understood mechanistically,               dynamic similarities already apparent between the two classes of                systems should make for a fruitful interplay between the two sets               of experiments and ultimately lead to a clearer picture of the                  operation of real neural networks such as those found in rhythmic               motor systems in general, or the stomatogastric nervous system in               particular.",
