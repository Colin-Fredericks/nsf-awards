 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer modeling is becoming a standard tool for experiment and theory.        It is being used to study extremely complex processes, ranging in scale         from the inner structure of the proton to star duster formation and             decay.  It can be an illuminating source of creative insights about the         structure and behavior of complex phenomena that were previously                inaccessible.  It is expected to provide dramatic breakthroughs in              physics, chemistry, genetics, meteorology, demography, and other fields.        Modeling can be made accessible and comprehensible to high school               students through the use of powerful new kinds of modeling tools that           combine visual representations of process structure and behavior with           effective support for student control of process interactions.  The             major goal of this project is the development of such tools and an              evaluation of their effectiveness of fostering scientific insight and           understanding.  The different types of models and the varied uses of            modeling in research will be described first, to help define the most           compelling opportunities for educational interventions.  The uses and           expressive power of different forms of representation will be                   investigated and the key cognitive issues that arise in the use of              modeling will be identified.  The various modeling tools that are               currently available will be analyzed to identify their scope of                 effective applications and to determine the need for new tools.  A              modeling laboratory comprised of a coherent set of tools for use in the         science curriculum will then be developed, together with preliminary            curriculum materials for a set of initial applications.  A formative            evaluation of the tools and materials will be conducted with a select           group of students.",
