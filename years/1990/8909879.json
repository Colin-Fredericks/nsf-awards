 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent emergence of masonry as an engineered construction                   material in the same class as concrete and steel has not been                   matched by equal advancements in standard test procedures for                   masonry.  Existing test procedures do not or are marginal in                    meeting today's needs and will be grossly inadequate for needs                  associated with future limit state design for masonry.                                                                                                          The U.S. Coordinated Program for Masonry Research as well as                    other NSF funded research has developed a broad database on                     the static and earthquake response of masonry especially                        reinforced masonry.  This research project uses these data to                   recommend needed improvements to masonry testing standards.                                                                                                     The research establishes specific needs that masonry tests                      must fulfill both for current needs and for future needs                        associated with  limit state design, critically reviews the                     ability of existing tests to meet these needs, it develops                      required modifications to existing tests, and it develops new                   tests where existing tests are lacking.                                                                                                                         The result of this study is a set of carefully documented                       recommendations for test standard modifications or additions                    applicable to earthquake and static behavior of structures.                     These recommendations provide the technical base to support                     actions by others or by standard writing bodies.",
