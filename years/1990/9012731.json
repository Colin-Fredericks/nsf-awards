 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical linear algebra has several important applications                in a wide variety of scientific and engineering applications.                        The generalized eigenvalue problem, Kx= lamda Mx, is of                    significant practical importance, especially in structural                      engineering where it arises as the vibration and buckling                       problem.  New software, LANZ, based on Lanczos' method is being                 developed for solving these problems.  LANZ uses a technique                    called dynamic shifting to improve the efficiency and reliability               of the Lanczos algorithm.  Improved method for solving symmetric                indefinite linear systems and for finding eigenvalues of the                    tridiagonal matrices that arise when using Lanczos' method are                  being studied.  A modification of Parlett and Scott's selective                 orthogonalization algorithm is being tested.  Implementations of                LANZ on a Convex C-220, Cray 2 and Cray Y-MP are being used to                  study the performance of the improved method and compare it with                a subspace iteration code used by structural engineers.  Research               leading to an efficient, robust implementation of LANZ on MIMD                  parallel systems with a large number of processors is proposed.",
