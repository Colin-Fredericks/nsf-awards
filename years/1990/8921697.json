 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although many people are successful in producing the number                     of children they desire, many others fail.  Understanding the                   reasons for the discrepancy between family size desires and                     outcomes over the past half-century will yield several                          benefits.  The results will clarify couples' decision-making                    vis-a-vis child-bearing and improve demographic predictions                     of fertility.  In addition, they can be used in designing                       programs to help those least likely to have the number of                       children desired.                                                                                                                                               This proposal contends that demographic theory and research,                    combined with contemporary social psychological perspectives,                   provide the means for achieving these research goals.                           Drawing on the work of Fishbein, the PI develops a model of                     fertility attitude-behavior consistency.  According to this                     model, intentions are the strongest direct determinant of                       fertility behavior.  However, attitude-behavior consistency                     varies with social psychological characteristics of                             individuals.  These include experience, significant/other                       conflict, resources, and psychological traits.  In addition,                    factors besides intentions, such as habits, \"behavioral                         scripts,\" and attitudes about children sometimes directly                       affect behavior.                                                                                                                                                Building on the PI's previous work with the 1941 Indianapolis                   Fertility Survey, hypotheses will be tested using the                           1987/1988 National Survey of Families and Households and the                    1957-1967 Princeton Fertility Studies.  Parity progression,                     logistic regression, and proportional hazards models are to                     be used in analyzing the data.",
