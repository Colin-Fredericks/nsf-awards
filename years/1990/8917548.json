 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many gases are exchanged between the atmosphere and the biosphere.              Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and oxygen are directly involved in                photosynthesis, the most quantitatively important process in the                biosphere.  The exchange of the gases involved with photosynthesis have         been studied in detail and much is known about the biochemistry and             biophysics of these exchanges.  In addition to these major gases many           trace gases are exchanged between the atmosphere and the biosphere.             Some of these trace gases, such as methane, affect the radiative                properties of the atmosphere and can contribute substantially to the            predicted warming of the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect.  Other              hydrocarbons such as isoprene and monoterpenes affect atmospheric               chemistry and lead to the production of ozone and carbon monoxide               through photochemistry.  Sulfur and nitrogen gases play important roles         in ecosystem acidification and nutrient cycling and may also influence          climate through the formation of cloud condensation nuclei.  Very               little work is currently being done by the plant physiology community           on these trace gas emissions from plants.  A three day workshop is              therefore proposed to assemble the existing information, and determine          what research is required to understand trace gas emissions from                plants.  This information will be assembled and published to stimulate          and help guide research in this area.",
