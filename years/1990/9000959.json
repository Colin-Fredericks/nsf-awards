 "awd_abstract_narration": "The year for  ATLANTIS II begins with an ALVIN cruise on the MId-               Atlantic Ridge.  ATLANTIS II then enters a shipyard for biannual                overhaul before proceeding to a cruise on the West Florida                      Escarpment and one in the Gulf of Mexico.  The vessel then                      transits the Panama Canal and begins a series of ALVIN programs                 in the Galapaos Islands, the East Pacific RIse and the Guaymas                  Basin.  An eighteen day non-ALVIN leg coring in the Sea of Cortez               is scheduled before the vessel transits to the Juan de Fuca and                 Oregon Margin areas for and ALVIN dive series.  Four legs in the                San Diego area complete the year for ATLANTIS and ALVIN.                                                                                                        R/V KNORR will return to Woods Hole after a fifteen month                       shipyard period during which the vessel was repowered and                       \"stretched\" thirty-four feet.  After re-outfitting with science                 deck gear, the ship will be ready for service about June 15, the                first cruise scheduled in a test of the newly reinstalled dynamic               positioning system.  The Marine-Light-Mixed Layer Program cruise                south of Iceleand precedes a program on the Blake  Plateau before               KNORR transits the Panama Canal to begin the extended cruise                    scheduled in the South Pacific for the World Ocean Circulation                  Experiment (WOCE).  The year ends with KNORR at sea in tech SOuth               Pacific on a leg to Tahiti.                                                                                                                                     The year for OCEANUS is comprised of nineteen voyages for a                     variety of disciplines, most of which are in and out of Woods                   Hole.  The vessel makes an extended trip to the Madeira Islands                 for the deployment of sensors for the subduction program in the                 spring.  The final cruise series of the year is in the southern                 tropical Atlantic for recovery and redeployment of gear placed by               OCEANUS early in 1989.  The year ends with the Vessel dockside in               Woods Hole.",
