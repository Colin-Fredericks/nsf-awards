 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skidaway Institute of Oceanography will operate the R/V BLUE FIN                during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of                     NSF-funded research projects.  The ship is a 72' general research               vessel built in 1972 and owned by the University System of                      Georgia.                                                                                                                                                        This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most                     oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.                                                                                                                       The R/V BLUE FIN operates primarily in the coastal waters along                 the southeastern U.S. It is a capable platform for these                        operations, and Skidaway has maintained an excellent program with               relatively low costs.",
