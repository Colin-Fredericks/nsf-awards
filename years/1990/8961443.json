 "awd_abstract_narration": "A technique is proposed whereby energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence            analysis can be made to accurately measure small concentrations ( 1%)           of an element in a sample whose composition is dominated (>90%) by an           element of similar but larger atomic number (Z).  Such measurement is           now precluded by the overwhelming fluorescence signal from the                  dominant element.  The proposed technique would employ a primary                photon source, a secondary fluorescer, one or more filters, and                 differential analysis of the observed spectra.  The key features of             the technique are (1) reduction of the fluorescence from the                    interfering element by appropriately shifting the incident energy               below the excitation of the dominant (K ) X rays and (2) incorporation          of secondary effects by use of a differencing scheme.  As an initial            demonstration of the technique, we will attempt to show that it is              possible to detect manganese (Z=25) at the 1% level in carbon steel             having  98% iron (Z=26).  Experimental verification of the technique            will be undertaken.",
