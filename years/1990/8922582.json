 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early research portrayed the jury as a decision-maker                      generally responsive to the evidence presented at trial.  More                  recently,  critics of the jury have raised a variety of questions               about jury competence,  voicing doubts about the ability of                     juries to analyze complex data logically and to return verdicts                 based on evidence rather than irrelevant considerations.  Critics               have advocated a variety of methods of reining in and controlling               the jury,  from a complexity exception to the constitutional                    right to a jury trial to less drastic measures like specially                   qualified juries and rules that limit the information juries                    receive and are permitted to use in making their decisions.  This               approach neglects the fact that the jury is an energetic                        information-processor who contribute as well as responds to trial               evidence.                                                                                                                                                       The proposed research seeks to examine the effects of recognizing               the jury as an active decision-maker.  It is planned to study                   jury responses to the anticipated consequences of their decisions               in three contexts:  automatic trebling of jury awards in anti-                  trust cases;  sentencing alternatives in capital cases;  and                    insurance status of the defendant in personal injury cases.  In                 each case,  the response of juries to traditional and new methods               of channeling and controlling their consideration of verdict                    consequences will be examined.  In a set of sub-experiments,  the               researchers will also assess reactions to expert testimony,                     looking at the way juror expectations about dangerousness and                   preferences for concrete versus abstract evidence affect their                  decisions.                                                                                                                                                      While there is a large body of research on the jury,  much of it                fails to go beyond studying the production of a verdict to                      examine the jury as an active information processor trying to                   make sense out of its task.  The proposed research explores how                 recognizing the jury's expectations and treating the jury as a                  collaborator helping to develop a meaningful basis for decision,                rather than as a passive recipient simply accepting information                 and instruction,  can help us better to understand its decisions.               It promises to improve both our conceptual framework and to                     answer policy-relevant questions about the rules and procedures                 that ought to govern the use of juries.",
