 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Dr. James E. Strum, Department of Chemistry,                      Lehigh University, is for enhancement of the physical chemistry                 laboratory course offered for students majoring in chemistry,                   biochemistry, and chemical engineering.  The project involves                   both curriculum development and Instrumentation for Laboratory                  Improvement and is supported by the Chemistry Division.  The                    physical chemistry laboratory curriculum would be modified to                   emphasize \"aggregated systems\", which are characterized by                      collective behavior of molecules or ions.  Such systems range                   from complex ions to macroscopic crystals and include micelles,                 vesicles, colloids, particle suspensions, liquid crystals, and                  membranes. Studies of such systems have increased considerably                  in the past decade and inclusion of these experiments will                      update this course and, by extension, laboratories in physical                  chemistry at other universities.                                                                                                                                Five new experiments will be developed: X-ray diffraction by                    molecular crystals, phase transitions in liquid crystals,                       surface area determination, pulse photolysis, and helix-coil                    transition.  The instrument acquisitions supported by this                      award are a differential scanning calorimeter, a surface area                   adsorption instrument, and a pulse photolysis apparatus.",
