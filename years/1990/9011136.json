 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post-event investigation project to learn                             engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                    1989).                                                                                                                                                          Response data from this earthquake, together with recorded                      motions from other earthquakes, provides an excellent basis                     for evaluating seismic design procedures in the Uniform                         Building Code (UBC).  With this objective in mind, this                         project considers several buildings (one in Watsonville and                     three in San Jose) where such strong motion records are                         available.  A system identification method (named MODE-ID)                      will be applied to estimate normal modes of vibration.  For                     each building, the optimal estimates of the model forces,                       overturning moments, interstory drifts, and lateral forces and                  torsional moments at each floor level throughout the building                   will be made.  The variation of these quantities, together                      with the modal periods and damping ratios, over the range of                    excitation levels will be assessed.  These results will be                      correlated with:  (1) the building's type of lateral force                      resisting system; (2) the vertical irregularities in the                        building; and (3) the building's observed seismic performance                   during each earthquake. This information will be used to                        assess procedures and design parameters in the current (1988)                   UBC and the version of the UBC that was used in the building's                  original design.                                                                                                                                                This effort will provide a critical assessment of the validity                  of the existing UBC seismic design provisions based on the                      real-world field performance data.",
