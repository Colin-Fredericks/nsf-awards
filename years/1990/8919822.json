 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Gowaty has discovered that gender affects interactions                      between caregiving adults (presumed parents) and nestling eastern               bluebirds:  Fathers feed their daughters more often than they                   feed their sons.  Is this because daughters have greater energy                 requirements than sons?  Dr. Gowaty will test the hypothesis that               daughters need more energy than do sons to grow to the same size                and weight.                                                                                                                                                     Gender-biased feeding occurs in those bird species in which                     gender interactions have been explored, but the proximate                       causation of such gender effects has not been evaluated.  Eastern               bluebirds provide an opportunity for efficient study of such                    effects because nestling bluebirds (unlike other species) can be                assigned to gender simply by the color of the primary wing                      feathers, and because data on how parents and nestlings interact                can be readily collected by filming inside a nest box.                                                                                                          The doubly-labeled-water method is a well-established technique                 for measuring metabolic rates of animals living in the wild.  Dr.               Gowaty will use this technique to evaluate the metabolic rates of               sons and daughters at various ages throughout nestling life.  If                daughters do not have higher metabolic rates than sons, the                     explanation for why fathers feed their daughters more than their                sons will require additional investigation.                                                                                                                     The findings of this research project will be important, if only                because it is the first attempt to measure metabolic differences                of sons and daughters of wild-living birds, information that is                 critical to understanding patterns of parental care by avian                    parents.  Whether or not sons and daughters differ in metabolic                 rates, the answer will be useful for elucidating the causation                  and control of parental care in birds.",
