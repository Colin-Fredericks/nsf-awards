 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this proposal is the experimental examination of                   lipid exchange rates between 'gel- and 'fluid-like' lipid                       clusters in membranes using model membrane systems.                             Theoretical modeling of lipid dynamics suggest that long range                  thermodynamic fluctuations of lipid chain conformations are                     responsible for several important membrane phenomena such as                    enhanced passive transport of sodium ion through the bilayer                    at the lipid 'melt' temperature and increased two-dimensional                   lateral diffusion rates.  However little direct experimental                    evidence of lipid structural fluctuations is available.                         Submicrosecond lipid reorientational processes which exists in                  the bilayer may be studied using polarized fluorescence                         measurements.  The fluorescence 'time-window' can be extended                   to span this critical submicrosecond region, by using                           fluorescence probes with lifetimes on the order of several                      hundreds of nanoseconds to detect submicrosecond acyl-chain                     motions.  This extended submicrosecond time window, which has                   not previously been explored, may provide the key to                            understanding important lipid membrane mediated events e.g.ion                  transport, fusion and membrane signaling.",
