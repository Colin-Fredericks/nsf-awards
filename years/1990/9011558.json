 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research, conducted in India, explores how economic                   development affects gender inequalities and the social position                 of women.  Official statistics are used to measure the gap be-                  tween males and females in (1) literacy rates and school gradua-                tion, (2) childhood mortality, (3) labor force participation, and               (4) occupational segregation.  These gaps tend to be large in                   northwest India and small in the south.  This geographical varia-               tion provides the opportunity to study causes of gender ine-                    qualities.   Data are analyzed from more than 300 Indian dis-                   tricts between 1961 and 1981.  The research examines how                        patterns of gender inequalities -- and changes in them  -- are                  related to growing industrialization, agricultural development,                 and social infrastructure (schools and medical facilities).   A                 by-product of this research will be the creation of a computer-                 ized data base of district-level statistics usable by both U.S.                 and Indian social scientists.",
