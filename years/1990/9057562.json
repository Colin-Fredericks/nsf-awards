 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work aims to develop a declarative paradigm of programming,                based on flexible constructs that can deal efficiently with large               volumes of data.  Commercial query languages and logic programs                 both extend relational algebra, which is a simple fragment of                   first-order logic.  These languages are declarative, in that                    their semantics can be specified non-operationally.  Programs can               thus be viewed as high-level specifications and are easier to                   develop, understand and maintain, and there is much promise for                 parallel execution.  Current implementation techniques that                     support logic programming cannot handle large volumes of data,                  and techniques for relational query languages cannot implement                  recursion, to name two limitations.  This work explores an                      approach based on program transformation followed by fixpoint                   evaluation that combines the focussing properties of logic                      program oriented techniques with the efficient set-oriented                     processing of relational techniques.  In addition to the                        challenges of efficient implementation, many aspects of the                     declarative programming paradigm, such as the right combination                 of features, the role of data abstraction and object identity,                  the semantics of negation and updates, and facilities for program               development and debugging are also being studied, and a prototype               language called Coral is being developed.",
