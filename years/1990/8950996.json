The students will use a digital storage oscilloscope, a            menu-driven X-Y plotter, and a sweep/function generator in                      conjunction with existing laboratory equipment to prototype and                 test a variety of signal conditioning and signal processing                     circuits and systems.  Groups of three students each will perform               their investigations in a video-assisted individualized                         instruction, multi-stationed undergraduate laboratory.  The new                 equipment along with existing laboratory equipment and the                      innovative video teaching system will offer individualized, hands- on           experience for the students in the use and understanding of                     modern signal processing.  This experience is most pertinent for                engineers using control instrumentation found in industrial                     integrated manufacturing systems.",
