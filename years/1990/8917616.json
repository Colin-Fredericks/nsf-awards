 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dehydration is a stressor that may be encountered by many organisms             during their lifetimes, including the period of body growth and organ           development.  Dehydration induces changes in hormone levels, including          prominently increases in levels of anti-diuretic hormone, and the               restricted water inhibits general body growth.  Together, these factors         may influence the growth and the development of many organ systems.             The research will focus particularly on the effects of dehydration              during growth on development of the kidney, a principle target organ            for anti-diuretic hormone.  The PI will study this problem in bobwhite          quail, a species in which the chicks must forage for themselves                 beginning shortly after hatching, and in which therefore there is a             very real possibility of dehydration during the early life stages.              Preliminary data suggest that the region of the kidney (the renal               medulla) primarily concerned with water conservation during dehydration         hypertrophies when the birds are chronically water restricted.                  Associated with this is an enhanced ability to concentrate the urine,           which should contribute to enhanced water conservation.  The proposed           research will further explore the functional consequences of chronic            dehydration, and in particular will examine the basis for the enhanced          concentrating ability.  Does this reflect changes in the rate of urine          formation, changes in hormone levels, or changes in the cellular                response to the hormone?  How do morphological changes induced by               dehydration correlate with changes in function?  Are these changes              reversible, or do stresses imposed during youth have consequences that          continue into adulthood?  These studies will help to define the                 physiological responses of animals to dehydration.  They will also              examine the relation between structure and function in the avian                kidney, about which much remains unknown or speculative.  More                  generally, these studies will examine the flexibility of an important           homeostatic system, and will address the general issue of the                   importance of environmental stresses on developmental pathways.  This           approach should identify constraints in design and function of the              avian kidney.  This relates both to the ability of individuals to               acclimate to changing environments, as well as to the ability of                species to invade and adapt to different habitats.",
