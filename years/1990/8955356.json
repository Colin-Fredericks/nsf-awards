 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to initiate a research program to study the development of           science process skills, through the identification and description of           these skills as they manifest themselves in the actual work carried out         by children in elementary classroom settings.  Insufficient research            exists about how science procedural knowledge develops:  how children           learn to observe, measure, predict, devise experiments, etc. and how            these skills develop with maturation and growth, especially in the              social context of classrooms.  Although these skills are part of many           science curricula and appear in state guidelines and scope and sequence         charts, they are seldom described developmentally.  The proposed                research will examine the emergence of these skills in classrooms               through the analysis of observational data already collected and from           observations in actual classroom settings.  The ultimate purpose of this        research is to make available a wider knowledge base to improve                 elementary science assessment.",
