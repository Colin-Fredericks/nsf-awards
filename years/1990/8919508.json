 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is dedicated to answering three basic                     questions about the development of the visual system:  1) how do                nerve cells connect to each other; 2) how do nerve cells know                   where to connect to each other and 3) how does nerve cell                       activity influence the connections?  The answers can be found by                studying the prenatal and postnatal development of the cat visual               system, which is remarkably similar to that in the human.                                                                                                       During development the connections nerve cells make are not the                 same as those found in the adult.  It is important, therefore, to               ascertain what determines which connections are eliminated or                   preserved.  Although it is known that activity influences which                 connections nerve cells make, it is not clear how it is done.                   This project will study the anatomy and physiology of developing                nerve cells and whether certain types of \"growth-associated                     proteins\" (GAP) regulate this process.                                                                                                                          Abnormal nerve cell activity during development may lead to birth               defects.  The use of certain drugs which cross from mother to                   fetus may have this effect.  Toxic substances could also affect                 the proper development of the visual system after birth by                      abnormally stimulating or inhibiting nerve cell activity.                       Studying the processes regulating normal development can further                our understanding of defects of the visual system.",
