 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Arthur J. Freeman of Northwestern                 University to continue an ongoing joint study of the electronic                 structure of solid materials with Professors Adolf Neckel and Raimund           Podloucky of the Department of Physical Chemistry of the University             of Vienna and Professor Peter Weinberger, Institute of Technical                Electrochemistry, Technical University of Vienna.  The collaborating            electronic structure theory groups at these universities have been              actively involved in the development of highly sophisticated, fully             self consistent local density computer codes for the calculation of the         electronic structures of bulk solids, surfaces and alloys.  They have           also been calculating from first principles spin polarized photocur-            rents which are of special interest to a recently established NSF-              funded Materials Research Group (MRG) on the Magnetic Properties of             Materials.  The Northwestern group brings extensive experience in the           calculation of the electronic structure of thin films and the two               Austrian groups offer capabilities to perform calculations of the               intensity of angle resolved photoemission and inverse photoemission.            They will use these computational methods to investigate jointly a              wide range of phenomena, including the magnetic properties of                   surfaces, interfaces, chemisorbed overlayers on surfaces, and the               spin polarized photocurrents of interest to the experimental members            of the MRG.  They are also interested in pursuing studies of the role           of oxygen disorder in the properties of the new high temperature                superconductors.                                                                                                                                                The new Materials Research Group is centered on an experimental                 program to use advanced spin-sensitive spectroscopic techniques and             advanced state of the art electronic structure calculations in a                coordinated program of research on magnetism and magnetic materials.            A key factor in the ability of the Northwestern group to calculate              spin-polarized photocurrents has been the Austrian-US exchange                  program.  It has permitted the development of software for exploiting           the powerful thin film capabilities developed at Northwestern and has           also contributed to research on photoemission from high temperature             superconductors.",
