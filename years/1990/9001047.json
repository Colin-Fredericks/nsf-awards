 "awd_abstract_narration": "Insect herbivores can have large effects on the performance,               life histories, and demography of plants, and often exert strong                natural selection on plant populations.  In addition, plants are                often exposed simultaneously to stresses from biotic (i.e.                      herbivory, parasitism) and abiotic (i.e. resource limitation,                   heat) sources.                                                                       This project will use the tallgrass prairie perennial                      Silphium integrifolium (Asteraceae) and one of its major                        herbivores, the gall wasp Antistrophus silphii                                  (Hymenoptera:Cynipidae), as a model system to examine how                       herbivory, nutrient stresses, and water stress interact to affect               life history and physiological responses of plants.                                  Experiments will address two specific questions.  1. How                   does gall infestation affect life-history traits and fitness                    components of Silphium intergrifolium?  2. How do nutrient                      limitation and water stress influence the physiological and                     growth responses of plants to gall insect attack?  To answer the                first question, plant physiology (i.e. photosynthesis, water                    potential), growth, biomass allocation, and reproduction will be                measured over a two-year period in experimentally galled and                    gall-free plants growing in natural field populations.  The                     second question will be addressed in a common garden experiment                 in which gall frequencies and nutrient/water availabilities will                be manipulated in a factorial design, and physiology, growth, and               reproductive output will again be measured.",
