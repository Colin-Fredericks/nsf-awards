This proposal requests funds to                 purchase major pieces of equipment to be shared by all major                    users of the facility.  The  requested equipment will be used in                a variety of research projects by staff members of the Museum, by               graduate students and postdoctoral fellows under the direction of               Museum staff members, and by other members of the academic                      community under direction of a Museum committee.",
