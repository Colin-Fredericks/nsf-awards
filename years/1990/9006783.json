 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) reveals                            quantitative information about local bonding configuations                      and molecular motions in solids.  NMR of liquid samples is                      a well developed technology, and is used on a routine basis                     in chemical laboratories.  NMR of solid samples is a much                       newer technique.  Because or its fairly recent emergence, a                     great number of problems have yet to be addressed with                          solid state NMR.  Because of its unique capabilities, NMR                       holds enormous promise to help answer these problems.                           Funds are requested to construct an NMR spectrometer.  The                      system and its subcomponents are a dual channel,                                spectrometer double heterodyne system, with a wide bore                         (100mm) 4.7 Tesla magnet.  The hydrogen nucleus resonance                       frequency is 200 MHz.  Finally, the cost of rf components                       increases with frequency.  Constructing a spectrometer with                     a maximum frequency of 200 MHz decreases the cost relative                      to higher magnetic field systems without hindering the                          experiments we wish to perform.  In-situ NMR spectroscopy                       of chemical processing, hydrogen diffusion, and heat                            treatment of materials will require the construction of a                       special probe, which will contain gas tubing, heating                           elements, and thermocouples.  An instrument will be built                       for less than one-half of the cost of a commercial                              instrument of comparable specifications.",
