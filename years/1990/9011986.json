 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a cultural anthropologist studying fertility,               mortality and wealth flows among peasant farmers in Kenya.  The                 research will test the theory of wealth flows, that fertility                   changes in response to the wealth parents expect to have under                  varying regimes of education, employment, and family                            responsibilities.  This research extends a year-long prior study                of a neighboring community, and will provide comparative                        information to test the implications of the theory.                                                                                                             This study is important because population growth is one of the                 major problems facing third-world countries such as Kenya.                      Unless planners can come to grips with the basic causes of                      declining fertility, economic development and security are                      precarious.  Improved understanding of the causes of variation in               fertility will help produce programs of fertility control, which                can ameliorate some of the development problems.",
