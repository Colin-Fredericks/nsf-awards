 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty Wisconsin teachers of earth and life science will be                     selected for involvement in each year of a three year project                   designed to increase content background and understanding of                    the nature of science through research experience.  Each                        teacher will participate in sessions with field research                        scientists to select a research project.  Seminars and formal                   class work will provide content relative to the geology or                      life science area of their research.  During the academic                       year, the participants will complete library research related                   to their selected problem.  Participants will attend seminars                   at which they will present their literature findings,                           interact with master teachers to discuss techniques for                         involving students in research, and discuss how to                              incorporate personal research into a curriculum.                                                                                                                During the summer and fall, the participants will conduct                       field research under the direction of a scientist.  Local                       university, college museum, or industrial scientists will                       provide technical consulting as needed.  A master high school                   teacher will provide general coordination.  During the second                   academic year participants will concentrate on writing                          reports and presenting findings at seminars.  The                               participants will present papers at the Annual Conference of                    the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters, and                        other appropriate professional associations.                                                                                                                    An amount equivalent to 60.1% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
