This will be done through                       the establishment of a committee of experts and the                             convening of two workshops addressing research needs and                        policy issues associated with specialty, high-value                             products and commodity. low-value chemical products.  A                         final report will be prepared that will provide a                               consensus opinion and present the needs and opportunities                       of the area for the next decade as biotechnology comes of                       age.                                                                                                                                                            A committee of experts will be recruited to address the                         needs of this study on bioprocess engineering.  The                             committee will be comprised of individuals from academe,                        industry, and government in areas such as bioprocess                            engineering, chemical engineering, molecular biology,                           cell, biology, quality assurance, and biosafety.  The                           committee will prepare a final report.",
