 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study various problems                     associated with the numerical solution of differential equations                that govern incompressible and compressible flows of fluids.  In                particular, he will study vortex methods for incompressible                     flows, the numerical capturing of oscillatory solutions of                      gasdynamic equations, and the use of dispersive approximations in               the solution of compressible flow problems.                                          Fluid flow problems in two and three space dimensions are                  governed by complicated systems of nonlinear partial differential               equations.  Often the only practical way to solve such systems is               to use a computer to generate approximate numerical solutions.                  But this is not all that easy either.  The principal investigator               will use what is called a vortex method to generate numerical                   solutions of the equations of incompressible and compressible                   fluid flow.  This basic method and the improvements on it made by               the principal investigator allow one to find accurate solutions                 in an efficient manner.",
