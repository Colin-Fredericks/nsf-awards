 "awd_abstract_narration": "To control a discrete event system, a                                           supervisor is introduced which enables and                                      disables events in order to prevent                                             undesirable behavior, that is, the events that                                  violate safety and other constraints.  It is                                    proposed that, in some applications, a                                          supervisor can take chances by not preventing                                   undesirable behavior that has very small                                        probability of occurring.  This can lead to                                     better performance.  A concise and \"logical\"                                    model is also proposed, which allows us to                                      combine controlled systems using conjunction,                                   disjunction, shuffle and sequential                                             compositions.  Forceful controllers are then                                    introduced, which force an event if a given                                     condition is true.  Finally, decentralized and                                  hierarchical control are formalized.                                            Conditions for decentralization will be                                         investigated.  If this research is successful,                                  it will enhance the applicability of the                                        theory of supervisory control to complex                                        discrete event systems such as manufacturing                                    systems, computer and communication systems.",
