 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides for the continued support of                           research on the behavior of fluids in thin shear layers in the                  limit of large Reynolds numbers.  The classical treatment of                    these phenomena regards the thin layer as an idealized vortex                   sheet and only includes the dissipative effects of viscosity                    (internal friction) in an ad hoc fashion that never comes to                    grips with the true nature of viscous forces.  In contrast the                  research in this award centers around analytical and                            computational methods for approximating solutions of the actual                 viscous equations in the limit of vanishing viscosity.  Specific                problems for study include the description of how viscous effects               influence the tendency for vortex sheets to develop curvature                   singularities.                                                                       Many fluid dynamical phenomena in nature are operative in                  the idealized limit of zero viscosity or zero surface tension.                  For example, the motion of bodies in air at speeds well below the               speed of sound can be studied under the approximation that the                  air is inviscid.  Of course, this is a fiction since air does                   have a small, nonzero viscosity, but the neglect of viscous                     effects is justified when calculating a host of aerodynamical                   coefficients, since the small effect of viscosity is not nearly                 as important as a larger effect, such as a pressure drop.                       However there are many fluid dynamical phenomena whose very                     existence depends upon the presence of a formally small force                   like viscosity, and it is just such phenomena that are the                      objects of study in this proposal.  In particular, this                         research will study how viscous effects influence the roll-up of                vortices inside of thin layers of fluids.",
