 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several important mathematical topics will be addressed in                 this project.  Its primary focus is the theory of several                       complex variables with emphasis on (a) mappings between domains                 in spaces of the same or different dimensions, (b) extension to                 the boundary of such maps and (c) the resulting regularity one                  can expect.                                                                          The basis for this work can be traced to the classical                     Riemann Mapping Theorem in one complex variable which states that               any two finite and simply connected regions can be transformed                  into one another by univalent analytic mappings.  The same                      question in several variables has two formulations.  This is due                to the observation that even elementary domains such as spheres                 and polydiscs cannot be transformed analytically into one                       another.  The work considers those domains which can be                         analytically mapped onto one another in a one-one fashion and                   those which effectively can be mapped onto one another in a (more               or less) finite-to-one-manner.  The latter functions are called                 proper mappings.                                                                     The research is concerned with questions of the following                  type.  If a proper map transforms one domain into another, what                 conditions on the boundary or the map ensure that the map can be                extended to the boundary?  If an extension exists, what is its                  degree of smoothness?  Considerable progress has been made on                   these questions when the two domains have curved and very regular               boundaries.  The object now is to reduce the assumptions on the                 boundaries and apply new results of complex analysis, geometry                  and partial differential equations to develop the theory to its                 fullest extent.  The main problem to be addressed in the near                   term is considerable in itself: one must show that a continuous                 map between certain manifolds is actually infinitely                            differentiable.  Results of this type are already known, but not                enough to suggest a path to the best possible conclusions.",
