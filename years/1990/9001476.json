This                              project is sponsored jointly by NSF and the                                     Chinese Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                                                    Professor Zhang is a leading nuclear structure                                  theorist active in worldwide research at the Niels                              Bohr Institute of the University of Copenhagen and                              the Joint Institute for Heavy Ion Research at Oak                               Ridge.  His visits with the experimental groups at                              SUNY Stony Brook and Brookhaven National Laboratory                             will focus on three research areas that involve                                 theoretical interpretation and guidance of the                                  experimental programs.  The three research areas                                are:  (1) nuclear shapes, (2) the source of nuclear                             collectivity, and (3) dynamic properties.  The                                  first area relates to the influence that specific                               nucleon orbitals have on the shape of the nucleus,                              the second to the role of the neutron. proton                                   interaction in the onset of collective motion in                                the nucleus, and the third to transitions from a                                specific region of stability involving rotational                               motion to another region.  The key to this program                              is the effective interaction between the experimental                           and the theoretical approaches to the understanding                             of these research areas.",
