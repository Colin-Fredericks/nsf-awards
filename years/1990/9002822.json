 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuprl is a system supporting the interactive development of formal              mathematics.  It was designed to be especially suited to                        computationally significant mathematics and to the construction of              formally verified software.  The implementation of Nuprl, funded by             the NSF, was completed in 1984.  Since then the system has been used            extensively at Cornell and elsewhere as a basis for further research.           This research has resulted in significant advances in the areas of              automated reasoning and computational logic.  The system has been               successfully applied to a wide range of problems, from verification of          computer hardware to an open problem in the theory of programming               languages.  It has been the subject of many articles and PhD theses.            The goal of the present project is to rewrite parts of the system in            order to incorporate certain extensions (a reflection mechanism) and            improvements (new definition facility).  These are based on several             years of study and experience with the system.  They will make the              system more accessible, both to researchers in the area and                     to others such as mathematicians and educators.  With the                       implementation of the reflection mechanism, Nuprl will be applicable            to domains that are currently difficult to treat.",
