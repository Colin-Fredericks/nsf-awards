 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phosphorus losses from many oligotrophic forests are                       extremely low due to a high level of biological control over                    P cycling within the forest floor.  Mineralized phosphorus is                   quickly taken up by roots and microorganisms, preventing its                    leaching from the rooting zone or its fixation by mobil                         aluminum.                                                                            As a student of Dr. Vogt, Mr. David Publicover will                        examine the role of ectomycorrhizae in the cycling and                          conservation of P within the forest floor of an upland pitch                    pine forest in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.  He hypothesizes                    that mycorrhizal tissue acts as an important storage                            reservoir for P released by decomposition outside of the main                   growing season.  This storage minimizes formation of                            insoluble P- Al compounds and leaching of P in                                  organometallic-phosphate complexes.                                                  Monthly sampling is used to determine seasonal patterns                    of P and Al storage and movement.  Sampling includes                            measurement of plant biomass accumulation, root and                             mycorrhizal productivity and turnover, input to and leaching                    from soil horizons, and P and Al fractions in soil horizons.                    Primary factors controlling P leaching from the rooting zone                    will be determined.                                                                  Experimental manipulations undertaken to investigate                       specific aspects of P conservation include: removal of                          ericaceous plants, augmentation and removal of litterfall, P                    fertilization, and augmentation of available Al.                                     This work on P conservation mechanisms in the root and                     mychorrhizal system addresses important issues in the area of                   forest management and conservation.  This information will                      help in the preservation of both temperate and tropical                         forest ecosystems.                                                                   Dr. Vogt is a very experienced and productive scientist                    who is well qualified to direct the doctoral research of                        David Publicover.  Mr. Publicover is also highly qualified                      with experience in forestry, forestry management, forest                        research and instruction.  The School of Forestry and                           Environmental Studies at Yale University has exceptional                        resources for supporting this research effort.",
