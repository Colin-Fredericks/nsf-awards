 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Alan MacDiarmid, Department of Chemistry, University of                         Pennsylvania and Professor Serge Lefrant, Laboratoire de                        Physique Cristalline, University of Nantes, France.  The                        objective of the project is the investigation of the properties                 of conductive polymers using the technique of Raman scattering.                                                                                                 Dr. MacDiarmid and his research group has expertise in the                      synthesis and characterization of conducting polymers, namely                   polyanilines and polyacetylenes.  The French laboratory has                     wide experience in studies of conducting polymers by means of                   resonance Raman scattering.  The investigators propose to                       extend previous experiments to measurements in polarized light                  of oriented samples.  A detailed analysis will be made of                       oriented polyacetylene, taking into account the corrections                     introduced by absorption and reflection coefficients measured                   experimentally at different wavelengths.  The French group                      has demonstrated that such measurements are feasible and                        preliminary results have shown important consequences                           concerning the interpretation of experimental data.  Results                    of the proposed research will lead to a better understanding                    of the structure of conducting polymer, an important topic in                   current materials research.",
