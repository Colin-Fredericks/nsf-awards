 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade advances in molecular biology,                           particularly recombinant DNA and molecular cloning                              technologies, have had dramatic and wide-reaching effects                       on many fields of biological research.  Several members of                      the faculty at CSULA have been using these powerful                             methods to gain important new insights into biological                          structures and regulation of biological processes.  Active                      research programs exploring the regulation of neuroactive                       peptide production and release, the expression of actin                         genes during development, the regulation of membrane                            development during the sporulation cycle of Bacillus                            subtilis, the structural definition of viral protein genes                      in mutant Sendai viruses in order to establish the                              molecular basis of their biological properties, defining                        the molecular signals for directing the orientation of                          viral budding in eukaryotic cells, studies of sub-cellular                      organization in higher plants, mechanisms of uniparental                        inheritance of mitochondrial and chloroplast DNA in                             Chlamydomonas, and studies of mechanisms regulating the                         expression of phosphate starvation-induction of gene                            expression in higher plants all depend heavily on the                           availability of the fundamental infrastructure of a well-                       equipped recombinant DNA research facility at CSULA.  The                       current facility, largely funded by our currently awarded                       RIMI grant, located at this urban university with its                           large and diverse minority enrollment, is providing a                           center of research excellence that promotes training for                        minority students and will be a focus for related work at                       the many neighboring State University Campuses.  This                           application requests continued support for this multi-user                      research facility, particularly for expanding our capacity                      to carry out diverse types of tissue culture, and for the                       individual research programs described above.",
