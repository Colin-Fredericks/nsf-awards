 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to design and implement 18 modern                hands-on experiments for the laboratory components of the two                   semester course sequence: mechanics of solids (statics and                      strength of materials) and dynamics (particle and rigid body                    motion).  In each course, students in groups of three select and                perform five of these experiments.  The aims are to give engineers two          significant experiences.  (1) Students learn first-hand modern                  measuring techniques using equipment that includes fully                        instrumented material testing machines, digital storage                         oscilloscopes, equipment for interfacing experiments with                       computers, automated data retrieval systems, and computer                       graphics.  (2) Students validate classical theories; but also gain new          insights into physical phenomena that are introduced in                         classroom lectures and then taken for granted.  From experiments,               for instance, they learn first hand the limits of elasticity for                engineering materials, and measures of motion.  With the                        laboratory experiences civil and mechanical engineering students                will gain some experimental expertise, but equally important, will              learn about the experimental method and the philosophy of                       engineering experimentation.",
