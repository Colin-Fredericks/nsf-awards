 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea of median filters can be generalized so as to lead to nonlinear        filters that include as a special case order statistic filters (Ll-             estimators).  Such filters can be very efficient in processing signals          of nongaussian nature and can be constrained to be robust against the           presence of occasional impulsive disturbances.  The coefficients of the         filter can be computed adaptively using extension of LMS and RLS                algorithm.                                                                                                                                                      This project is involved in deepening the understanding of the                  properties of the generalized filters, particularly when used in an             adaptive signal processing framework.  Preliminary results show very            promising performance.  The impact of the study can be considerable in          the signal processing practice since all linear digital filters                 (recursive and nonrecursive) could be upgraded with small computational         increase to be also order statistic filters.  Robustness and improved           performance would easily be gained in presence of nongaussian signals.",
