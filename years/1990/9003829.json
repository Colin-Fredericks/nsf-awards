 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nuclei of many galaxies show evidence of mild activity, such                as very broad (but weak) emission due to hydrogen.  These are                   generally thought to be scaled-down versions of luminous active                 galactic nuclei (AGNs), in which matter is probably being accret-               ed by a massive black hole.  During the past few years, however,                a few investigators have speculated that the properties of low-                 luminosity AGNs might instead be explained by processes related                 to central bursts of star formation.  Although this is not a                    popular idea, recent evidence from observations of supernovae                   lend some support to this idea.  This research will explore this                model from both theoretical and observational approaches.                                                                                                       Dr. Filippenko is an extremely active young astronomer, who has                 most recently been much concerned with the design and utilization               of automated observatories in the study of active galactic nuclei               and extragalactic supernovae.  He currently holds a Presidential                Young Investigator award.",
