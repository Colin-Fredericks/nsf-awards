 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will do a systematic, global study of seismic                   deformation at convergent plate boundaries within the framework                 of plate tectonics.  The patterns of seismic deformation observed               at convergent plate boundaries are often not in accord with plate               tectonic theory in its simplest form.  The work will make use of                catalogs and compilations of earthquake focal mechanisms as well                as geological data regarding rates of late Quaternary fault                     offsets.  The goal of the proposed work is to develop a global                  survey or map of seismic (instantaneous) deformation at and in                  the vicinity of plate margins, which can be compared with plate                 tectonic model predictions and, hopefully, in the near future,                  large numbers of geodetic measurements that will become available               as space-based geodetic (GPS and VLBI) surveys progress.  This                  research is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard                       Reduction Program.",
