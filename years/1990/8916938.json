 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to function in              vertebrate embryos, and as such is critical to the development of all           subsequent tissues and organs.  Yet, the development of embryonic               cardiovascular physiology remains very poorly understood for any                vertebrate, including birds and mammals.  This project will investigate         the development of cardiovascular physiology in amphibian larvae, which         are highly appropriate as a model for vertebrate embryos in general.            Measurements will be made of heart rate, cardiac output, blood pressure         and peripheral resistance.  The experiments will be designed to                 determine the onset of, and subsequent developmental changes in, the            basic heart functions (heart rate, arterial blood pressure, cardiac             output, peripheral resistance) of the immediate post-hatch anuran               larva.  Once basic hemodynamics have been measured, then the                    development of the ability of the heart to regulate its own function            will be described.  This study will be the first comprehensive                  investigation of the development of cardiovascular function in any              lower vertebrate.  Amphibian development traditionally has served as a          general model for vertebrate development, and consequently the                  physiological studies will have broad applicability to both vertebrate          physiology and developmental biology, particular in the absence of              substantial published data on either bird or mammal embryos.",
