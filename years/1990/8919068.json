 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will continue ongoing research concerning the                         construction of a theory and the related computer algorithms for                the efficient assessment of knowledge.  The key concept of the                  theory is that a knowledge structure, that is, a basic set of Q                 of questions or problems in a given domain of information,                      equipped with a distinguished family of subsets called the                      knowledge states.  The interpretation of these concepts is that                 the knowledge state of a student is the set of all those problems               in the basic set Q that the student is capable of solving.  A                   probabilistic version of these concepts has been developed,                     permitting an analysis of the data with standard statistical                    techniques.  The knowledge assessment routines were developed in                the framework of Markov chains theory.  The focus of this work                  will be the application of the theory in one particular case,                   namely, the Regents Competency Test in Mathematics of June, 1987.               Other aspects of the research include investigation of a number                 of technical questions regarding the combination of distinct                    knowledge structures and practical adaptation and implementation                of knowledge assessment procedures.",
