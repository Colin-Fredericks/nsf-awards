 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Franklin Y.                          Cheng, Department of Civil Engineering, University of                           Missouri-Rolla, to pursue with Dr. Chang-Koon Choi,                             Department of Civil Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute                       of Science and Technology (KAIST) for a period of 24                            months, a program of cooperative research on nonlinear                          behavior and marginal safety of low-rise reinforced                             concrete shear wall systems against interacting ground                          motions.  Low-rise civilian buildings comprise the                              overwhelming percentage of building construction in the                         U.S. and Korea.  For such structures with reinforced                            concrete walls, the height-to-width ratios are small.                           Under seismic loads, these walls experience shear                               deformation rather than the bending experienced by walls in                     taller structures.  Research currently in vogue deals                           mainly with bending deformation of high-rise structures                         within the elastic limit.  The present cooperative                              research, on the other hand, will consider the amount of                        reserve strength between the elastic limit and failure for                      walls of low height-to-width ratios.  Structural behavior                       in this range is nonlinear, and new analytical models must                      be developed to predict the behavior of new and repaired                        structures.  These models will be tested and verified                           against experimental results.  Damage studies will be based                     on experimental behavior and calculated results.  In                            addition, building code specifications will be assessed.                                                                                                        Considerable progress has been made in predicting the                           behavior of high-rise structures subjected to                                   multicomponent seismic input.  Much remains to be done                          toward predicting the behavior of low-rise structures,                          improving their ability to withstand earthquake loads, and                      the strength of rehabilitated structures.  The                                  collaborators on this project are well suited to undertake                      such work.  The U.S. PI's previous work has dealt with a                        model of macro-element formulation which reliably predicts                      the response of structural systems but does not yield                           detailed information on localized deformations of                               individual walls.  The Korean PI has experience in                              micro-element analysis which can be used for observing                          localized deformations.  Their models are complementary for                     examining the relationship between system and element                           deformations.   The solution to the problems addressed by                       this project would be beneficial to the United States and                       Korea.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                       U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program which seeks to                           increase the level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean                       scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific                     information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
