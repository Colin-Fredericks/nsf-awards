 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for the Development of Education (NCDE) is                  conducting a regional seminar on science-based computer                         learning/simulation resources for faculty in two-year colleges,                 primarily from California.  The seminars, based on an alliance between          two-year colleges, campus-based software developers, and the NCDE, is           utilizing instructional materials developed and evaluated by science            faculty.  Curriculum tracks within the NCDE program are providing               intensive hands-on opportunity in exploring potential classroom                 applications and instructional impacts of instructional technology              developed specifically for the science classroom by science faculty.            Participants are working with science faculty who have developed and            are using instructional software in their classes.  Additionally                plenary sessions are addressing the major issues affecting science              curriculum in two-year colleges; the dynamics of curriculum development         and reform, the process of software development, and key aspects of             technology utilization in undergraduate instruction in the biological           and physical sciences.                                                                                                                                          The two year colleges are contributing travel funds for the                     participating faculty.",
