 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complete developmental and molecular analysis of the 1(2)Cf                   (Cf) gene in Drosophila melanogaster will be carried out.  Cf                   mutations produce brain hemispheres 5-10x the normal size in late               3rd instar larvae without affecting the ventral ganglion.  Cf                   brain tissue when transplanted into wild type adult hosts becomes               tumorous and malignant.  The cloned gene is located within 46kb                 of the dopa decarboxylase gene and is part of the Ddc gene                      cluster which is involved in catecholamine metabolism and                       scleroticizaton of the cuticle.  Cf mutations also produce a                    weakened cuticle phenotype in pharate adults and are cell lethals               in adult epidermis.                                                                                                                                             Sequencing of the cloned gene will be completed and the derived                 amino acid sequence examined to determine the nature of the                     protein and its possible function.  Homology to vertebrate genes,               some of which may be potential tumor suppressor genes, will be                  sought.  To investigate Cf's role in development, the                           distribution of its mRNA and protein in tissue sections will be                 examined.  Definitive answers will be sought by studying two                    aspects of neurogenesis, cell proliferation and differentiation,                in mutant and control flies in vivo.                                                                                                                            The Cf+ gene product may be involved in a specific step in                      catecholamine metabolism which would implicate a catecholamine                  derivative not only as a factor in scleroticization of the                      cuticle but also as a specific neural cell growth regulator in                  the CNS.  To investigate this possibility a survey of biogenic                  amine pools throughout development and in specific tissue of Cf                 and wild type will be completed.",
