 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function of the nervous systems depends on the signaling of                 nerve impulses across the nerve cells at a structure called                     synapse.  A group of molecules in the membrane of the receiving                 post-synaptic nerve cells, the transmitter receptors, are                       responsible for receiving the chemical signals from the pre-                    synaptic nerve cells.  The metabolism, mobility, and the                        distribution of these receptors determine the efficiency and                    stability of the signaling at the synapse.  The purpose of the                  present project is to examine when the glutamate receptors are                  synthesized in the developing nerve cells, how do they become                   segregated into different regions of the cell membrane, how their               distribution at the synapse become concentrated as synapse                      matures, and whether the concentrated distribution can be further               modified by the use of the synapse.  The result from this study                 will help us to understand the role of transmitter receptor                     dynamics in the synaptic functions as well as in the disease                    states, during embryonic development and in adult life.",
