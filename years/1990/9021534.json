 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oklahoma State University proposes a planning grant to                          establish an Alliance for minority Participation.  The                          proposed Alliance would involved minority students from                         throughout Oklahoma including those at Oklahoma State                           University, Langston University, our traditional minority                       campus, and other regional and private institutions.  The                       activities that would be carried out under the Alliance                         represent logical extensions, to support AMP goals, of                          programs which we currently have in operation in one or more                    of our units.  Our Alliance will include mentoring and                          community building activities on the several campuses,                          greatly increased research opportunities for minority                           students enrolled at the predominantly undergraduate                            institutions, and will address the critical bridges                             from high school to college and college to graduate school.                     A special feature of our Alliance will be the use of                            satellite television to deliver enrichment activities to the                    Alliance institutions.  Since these transmissions will be                       available nationwide, the program has the capability of                         immediate national impact.",
