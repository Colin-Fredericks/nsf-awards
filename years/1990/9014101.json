Project funding will allow Dr. Guler to                spend eight months in Dr. Goodings laboratory in order to                       collaborate on a series of geotechnical centrifuge models                       investigating the effects on geotextile reinforced retaining                    walls.  Research results may bring about new design techniques                  for less expensive construction of retaining walls.                                                                                                             Scope:  This proposal will bring together research scientists                   from the universities of two countries working in the area of                   geotechnical centrifuge models.  It is anticipated that this                    collaborative research will result in the development of new                    design techniques for retaining walls.  Dr. Guler will have an                  opportunity to familiarize himself with research equipment that                 is presently not available in his university.  Therefore, this                  proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in Developing                        Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific                    knowledge through an international collaboration.",
