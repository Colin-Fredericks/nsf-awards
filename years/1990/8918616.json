The research will consist of an                   integrated program of computer and mathematical modeling,                       together with empirical studies of nine forest tree species that                are components of the transition oak-northern hardwoods forests.                The empirical studies will provide the data necessary to                        calibrate explicitly spatial models of forest communities that                  include: (1) competition for light, water and mineral nutrients,                (2) dispersal, (3) disturbance and (4) soil and topographic                     heterogeneity.  During the study, models that apply to the                      landscape level and yet retain fine-scale resolution important to               single individuals will be developed.  The models will be                       designed so that they may be tailored to forecast the                           consequences of energy-related and other anthropogenic                          perturbations such as acid rain, elevated to CO2, and ultraviolet               radiation, and global warming.  The principal objective of the                  work is, generally, to understand the factors controlling forest                community dynamics and structure, and, specifically, to identify                the ecological processes responsible for observed spatial and                   temporal patterns across a broad range of scales and determine                  how these processes become represented in scale-dependent                       pattern.",
