The objective of             the project is the detailed sampling and analysis of long piston                cores collected in the Central Indian Basin during the 1989 coring              expedition of the French research vessel Marion Dufresne.                                                                                                       In the region where the cores were collected, the Neogene radiolarian           assemblages are well preserved and the paleomagnetic polarity record            can be readily identified.  Using the long cores, the investigators             will be able to refine and extend precise calibrations of faunal                datum levels with the magnetic polarity time scale into the Late and            Middle Miocene.  They will also be able to integrate the silica                 records with those of cores taken from previous expeditions on this             vessel.  Through this synthesis, the investigators expect to be able            to interpret the regional silica distribution patterns in terms of              the tectonic and paleoceanographic history of the Central Indian                Ocean.  This study may provide important constraints on subsequent              models by evolutionary biologists.  The qualitative data may point              the way toward stratigraphic intervals and geographic regions where             time-transgressive evolutionary patterns can be further substantiated           using other microfaunal and microfloral fossil marine organisms.  The           project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the two                investigators in micropaleontology and sedimentology.",
