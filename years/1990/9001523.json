 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is devoted to the study of choice of the form                of the statistical regression function in terms of the exogenous                variables in the model when the number of exogenous variables is                large. The common practice is to impose conditions such as                      linearity or additivity to avoid the difficulties associated with               sparse data in high dimensions. Estimates of average derivative                 functionals will be used to select or reject a particular                       restriction on the form of the regression. The functionals                      considered are of integral type which may allow their estimation                at the usual parametric rate. Estimators of these functionals                   which are based on kernel density estimators will be considered                 and their large sample properties analyzed. These estimators will               then be used to test various hypotheses concerning the form of                  the regression function. The finite sample behavior of the                      proposed estimators and tests will be studied using constructed                 and real data. Under certain conditions these estimators will be                studied for their use in identifying projection directions in                   projection pursuit regression. Similar functionals closely                      resembling the Fisher information matrix  will be used to                       determine directions in projection pursuit density estimation.",
