 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a very critical problem of declining                     enrollments faced by all undergraduate computer science programs                across the nation.  Many key factors contributing to this decline               have been identified.  One important element is the lack of                     challenging research and project opportunities for the students.                Undergraduate studies in computer science is perceived by students              as long hours spent in text book reading and doing mundane                      programming assignments.  This is at a time when exciting                       discoveries are being made and the discipline is expanding at an                ever increasing rate.  It appears that the problem of declining                 enrollment is a reflection of the gap which exists between                      research/development and undergraduate studies in computer science.             This project approaches the declining enrollment problem by                     introducing a challenging research/project component to the under-              graduate computer science courses.  The laboratory associated with              the project is exclusively for undergraduate research.  Principal               equipment necessary for this facility includes 6 SPARC1                         workstations, a plotter, a printer, and a tape drive.  The                      laboratory will be used by students to work on research projects                with faculty in the areas of Computer Chip Design (VLSI), Computer              Graphics, and Parallel/Distributed Processing projects.  The award              is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                          investigator's institution.",
