 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research described in this application is                     concerned with understanding the chemical machinery that                        underlies 24-hour (circadian) cycles.  Circadian cycles are                     common in the plant and animal kingdom and organize a number of                 important processes including sleep and waking in humans.  The                  biochemical mechanisms that generate such a long cycle are not                  known.                                                                                                                                                               The investigations will use a model system, the eye of a                   marine mollusc Aplysia.  This eye has all the machinery for                     expressing many cycles of a circadian rhythm of nerve impulse                   frequency, under constant conditions of darkness and temperature,               when isolated from the rest of the animal.  The principal                       investigator will use biochemical and physiological methods to                  generate data about the mechanisms of this neuronal circadian                   cycle.  The major approach will be to study the timing of                       appearance of particular proteins during the circadian cycle.                   From the amino acid sequence of these proteins the principal                    investigator will synthesize oligonucleotide probes which can be                used to clone the gene messages that code for these proteins.                   These studies will begin to us what genes and proteins are being                expressed specifically during the circadian cycle.",
