This is the companion to the CURRICULUM AND              EVALUATION STANDARDS FOR SCHOOL MATHEMATICS (CESSM), which has become a         milestone in the history of school mathematics.  These two sets of              standards represent NCTM's comprehensive and carefully articulated plan         to provide direction for the reform of school mathematics in the United         States.  The Professional Standards will consist of three components:           standards for teaching, standards for professional development, and             standards for evaluation.  Production and dissemination are modeled             after the successful patterns used for CESSM, including the highly              effective review process that vests ownership with the entire NCTM              membership.  This is a special Teacher Enhancement project in that it           includes no direct work with participants. The National Council of              Teachers of Mathematics has contributed an amount equal to 99% of the           National Science Foundation request.",
