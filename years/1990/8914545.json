The U.S. principal                        investigator, Dr. Marsha Rosner of the University of Chicago is                 cooperating with the Indian converner of the conference, Dr. P.                 Chakrabarti of the Bose Institute.  The conference is decribed as a             one-of-a-kind international conference to address fundamental issues            of membrane structure and function.  The organizing committee                   consists of a noted scientist from the following countries: United              States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Belgium and India.                                                                                                        Scope:  The proposed conference will provide a unique opportunity for           American scientists working in membrane-related areas to establish              collaborations and relationships with researchers from all                      participating countries.  Membrane research in the beginning covered            a broad range of subjects, but soon began to specialize in narrowly             focused fields of research.  This specialization is now seen as a               disadvantage in loss of perspective and knowledge that other                    disciplines may provide membrane research.  This cross-disciplinary             conference is a means to open-up and advance new ideas and                      information in the field.  This proposal fulfills the criteria of the           U.S. - India Cooperative Science Program regarding the support of               international conferences and workshops dedicated to the exchange of            information and to expand scientific cooperation.",
