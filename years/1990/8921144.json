 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program has made a grant to                 Professor Charles Johnson. His research work on chemical rates                  involves the use of strong electric, magnetic and laser light                   fields to better understand how molecules move in solution and                  at what velocities.                                                                                                                                             The high resolution electrophoretic nuclear magnetic resonance                  (ENMR) experiments have been carried out in free solution on                    samples with low ionic strengths. The experimental conditions                   (and problems) encountered here are similar to those found in                   electrophoretic light scattering. The preliminary work                          indicates a host of intriguing applications to be explored. It                  will become a major branch of NMR for the study of aqueous                      solutions and suspensions. This study outlines some initial                     applications of ENMR. In addition to the ENMR work, Professor                   Johnson will continue his studies in holographic Rayliegh                       scattering (HRS). The HRS spectrometer with high frequency                      phase modulation represents a major advance in instrumentation                  for transient grating spectroscopy. In particular, they will                    explore the Soret effect for macromolecules in laser induced                    temperature patterns.",
