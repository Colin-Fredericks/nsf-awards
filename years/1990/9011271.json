 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three.year collaborative Research project                             between Dr. George Keulks, University of Wisconsin                              at Milwaukee and Dr. C. S. Fang of Institute of                                 Physics, Academia Sinica, Taiwan, sponsored by the                              AIT.CCNAA Cooperative Science Program.  This                                    proposal was submitted by Dr. David Tong, who was a                             NSF Program Director for the Condensed Matter                                   Theory Program.  Because NSF does not allow                                     previous program officers to negotiate with the                                 Foundation within a year of the person's departure,                             Dr. George Keulks replaces Dr. Tong as a P. I. for                              this proposal.  This proposal plans to study the                                formation of metal semiconductor interfaces and                                 subsequent growth of semiconductor substrates.                                  The Institute of Physics Academia Sinica in Taiwan                              has invested more than 1 million dollars in the                                 acquisition of state.of.the.art ultra.high vacuum                               spectroscopic instruments, which are essential in                               making experimental measurements for testing Tong's                             semiconductor structure model.  At present,                                     Taiwan's Institute of Physics is one of the few                                 places where such \u001ameasurements can be made and only                            place which makes experimental \u001ameasurements on the                             metal, Ga.  This study can expand our understanding                             of surface structure, which is essential in the                                 development of new and advanced materials, many                                 which have been used for making computer chips and                              other electronics.",
