 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three investigators will study problems interrelating the                  geometry and topology of finite dimensional manifolds with                      analytic, algebraic, and geometric properties of various function               spaces that arise in the study of ordinary and partial                          differential equations on these manifolds.  One investigator will               study symmetry groups of a variational problem and the geometry                 of their associated sections and slices.  The second will                       investigate the Grassmannian structures of the solution to                      integrable systems and the related Painleve analysis of these                   structures.  And the third will analyze the relationship between                the Laurent solutions to integrable systems and the geometry of                 their invariant tori.                                                                These three investigators will extend theories involving the               geometry and algebra of certain integrable systems.  One example                of such systems are Hamiltonian differential equations which                    model the physical behavior of moving objects.  These incorporate               conservation of energy and momentum in an elegant manner.                       Solutions to these systems tend to circulate and don't                          have many of the properties of systems which incorporate                        friction.",
