 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the project is a structural and functional                  analysis of the LexA protein of Escherichia coli.  This protein                 undergoes a self-cleavage reaction, termed autodigestion, which                 inactivates its repressor function.  In vivo, cleavage requires                 an activated form of another protein, RecA.  In vito data                       indicate that RecA acts, not as a classical protease, but by                    stimulating LexA autodigestion.  The proposed research will                     analyze further the mechanism of autodigestion and the role of                  RecA in stimulating this reaction, using a combination of                       genetics, biochemistry, and protein chemistry.  Mutations in lexA               and recA will be isolated which affect either the interaction                   between the two proteins, or the rates of one or both cleavage                  reactions.  In particular, mutant proteins which cleave faster                  than wild-type LexA will be studied, with the goal of identifying               and analyzing the rate-limiting step(s) in cleavage.  It is                     planned to isolate crystals of LexA and of complexes with the                   operator and with activated RecA for use in x-ray                               crystallographic analysis.  Structural information gained from                  this analysis can be correlated with the genetic and biochemical                data.  These studies are of general interest for the insights                   they offer into self-processing reactions, which are observed in                a wide range of important biological molecules, including self-                 splicing RNA, growth factor receptors, viral polyproteins, and                  oncogene products.",
