The objective of this project is to analyze and evaluate the                    effects of the Loma Prieta earthquake of 17 October 1989 on                     the electric power transmission systems in the earthquake-                      affected areas.  The studies are intended to develop                            additional information for defining seismic fragility                           functions of major transmission equipment, which are necessary                  and essential for a comprehensive reliability analysis of                       electric power supply systems for metropolitan areas.  The                      study will also evaluate the perfomance of the main                             transmission systems, in terms of the probability of power                      disruption at specified service areas caused by the                             earthquake.  The results of the study program will be prepared                  to constitute part of a comprehensive report on the Loma                        Prieta earthquake.                                                                                                                                              The project will contribute to the definition of the seismic                    fragility functions of electric transmission equipment and                      devices and to the development of theoretical models for such                   systems.",
