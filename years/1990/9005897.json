 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the question of how the light cues                      that control plant physiological and developmental processes                    are perceived.  Currently, the only plant regulatory                            photoreceptor that has been isolated is the red/far red                         light-responsive chromoprotein phytochrome.  Preliminary                        studies show that three to five divergent phytochrome                           apoproteins are encoded by a phy gene family in Arabidopsis                     thaliana and that similar phy gene families are present in                      many, perhaps all, flowering plants.  It is proposed that in                    vivo attachment of a light-absorbing chromophore to the phy                     polypeptides generates a multi-component red/far red-sensing                    photoreceptor system.  The goals of this project are to:  1)                    determine the sequences of all of the A. thaliana                               phytochromes from phy gene and cDNA clones, 2) analyze the                      regulation and localization of the phy mRNAs, and 3) assign                     functions in photoregulation of plant growth and reproduction                   to specific phytochromes by analyzing A. thaliana                               photomorphogenic mutants.  This investigation addresses                         fundamental questions concerning the complexity of plant                        photoreceptor systems and the mechanism of the initial steps                    of plant light perception.                                                                                                                                      A large number of plant cellular and developmental processes                    including gene expression, growth rate, cellular                                differentation, and timing of reproduction are responsive to                    the light  environment.  Physiological experiments indicate                     that there are at least three major pigment systems active in                   perception of light cues, one of which is the red/far red                       light-responsive pigment known as photoreceptor phytochrome.                    Biochemical and immunological studies suggest that there is                     more than one form of phytochrome.  Since no specific                           physiological function has been assigned to any of the                          phytochromes, it is clearly possible that each carries out a                    specific role in light perception.  Up to this time, however,                   it has been very difficult to identify unambigously these                       individual pigment proteins and determine their functions.                      The isolation of DNA clones corresponding to these proteins                     and the development of specific molecular probes to                             distinguish among them will lead to rapid advances in this                      field and a better understanding of their role in plant                         growth and development.*** //",
