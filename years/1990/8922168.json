 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Roger L. Simpson and others in his                research group at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University           (VPI) for collaboration in engineering research with Professor Franz            Durst and others of the Fluid Mechanics Group at the University of              Erlangen, Federal REpublic of Germany.  The objectives of their                 collaboration are to exchange advanced experimental techniques for              turbulent separated flows and to develop improved turbulence models for         separated flows based on their collective accumulation of data.  Both           groups are leaders in research on the turbulent structure of separated          flows and in aspects of experimental techniques for separated flow.             Their experience and unique facilities are complementary.  VPI                  concentrates on unsteady and three-dimensional external separated               flows and has developed rapidly scanning laser anemometry and                   sensitive pressure fluctuation measuring techniques.  The Erlangen              group concentrates on internal separated flows, such as in ducts and            other flow passages, and is a leader in developing advanced laser               anemometry techniques.  The micro-LDV designs and developments in               Erlangen will allow the VPI group to build and mount units in dynamic           wind tunnel models.  VPI pressure fluctuation techniques will be                applied to internal separated flows in Erlangen.                                                                                                                Separated flow is well recognized as the limiting factor to the                 performance of aircraft and sea vehicles, jet engines, ducted flow              systems, and other practical devices.  Until the development of laser           anemometry, little basic understanding of the nature of separated               flow was possible.  In the last fifteen years, the VPI and Erlangen             groups have made a number of significant contributions to the basic             understanding of turbulent separated flow.  Work on more complicated            separation problems will be continued by these groups under the                 proposed support.",
