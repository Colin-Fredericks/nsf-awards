 "awd_abstract_narration": "West Indies Laboratory (WIL) of Fairleigh Dickinson University                  (FDU) is a scientific teaching and research facility located in                 the northeastern Caribbean Sea on the island of St. Croix.  For                 18 years biologists, ecologists and geologists (from institutions               throughout the U.S. and the world) working at WIL have                          significantly added to our knowledge of   (1) the structure and                 function of shallow water tropical marine systems, particularly                 coral reefs and seagrass beds, and  (2) the biology, ecology and                paleo-ecology of tropical marine organisms.  In a period of                     increasing pressure on nearshore environments and organisms from                both local human impacts and also global environmental changes,                 an understanding of these natural systems is critical.                                                                                                          This project provides funds to purchase  (1) instruments to                     record long term physical oceanographic and atmospheric data and                (2) photodocumentation equipment:  a dissecting photo-microscope                and underwater video system.                                                                                                                                    The strengths of the research effort at WIL continue to be the                  combination of field with laboratory studies and                                multidisciplinary approaches to questions.  However, present                    research efforts are hindered by lack of long term environmental                data.  A reliable program of monitoring and storage of                          environmental data combined with the ability to document                        biological, ecological and geological phenomena photographically                will be of considerable value to present research at the                        laboratory as well as future research programs.  The results of                 much of this research can be useful both as a predictor of                      possible future changes in nearshore tropical environments, as                  well as information upon which to base management decisions.",
