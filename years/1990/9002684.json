 "awd_abstract_narration": "Weber State College will connect their campus network to                      WESTNET (a regional network which is part of the NSFNET).  Direct               connection to WESTNET will provide researchers with improved                    access to national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and USENET.                    Improvement is sought in reliability, speed, turn-around,                       flexibility, and functions such as file transfer, remote login,                 and teleconferencing.                                                                                                                                             The Weber State College connection to WESTNET will support and                enhance currency and excellence in teaching and research by                     facilitating collaborative research, curriculum development, as                 well as communication among national committees on which faculty                serve and chair.  Access though WESTNET to bibliographic material               and to computer systems not available on campus such as                         supercomputers will broaden the computing base for both faculty                 and students.  This universal availablity will enhance students'                preparation for courses and seminars and will especially impact                 students in science and engineering.***//",
