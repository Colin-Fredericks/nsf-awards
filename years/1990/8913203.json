This conference will be held July               16-20, 1990 at DePaul University's Lincoln Park campus in                       Chicago.                                                                             The study of polynomial identities has been of great                       interest in non-commutative ring theory since Kaplansky's result                in 1948 that a primitive ring satisfying a polynomial identity                  must be a simple algebra of finite dimension over its center.                   Work in the seventies and early eighties by Formanek, Procesi,                  Regev, and others established connections between the theory of                 polynomial identities, representation theory, invariant theory,                 and combinatorics.  There is presently much interest in the area,               recently spurred by Kemer's solution to the Specht problem.  A                  series of ten talks by Professor Formanek will be geared to a                   diverse audience, and meant to provide participants with                        information and insights into the recent advances in these areas.",
