 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Brzezinski proposes to study the cycling of silicon and                     silicic acid as a limiting nutrient during the development and                  demise of diatom blooms of Southern California.  These and                      other diatom blooms frequently flocculate and sink en masse                     without the intervention of grazers, unknown.  Flocculation                     often occurs coincident with the depletion of silicic acid from                 the euphotic zone suggesting that silicon limitation can                        trigger these events.  They will combine the fine scale                         sampling capabilities of divers using SCUBA with sophisticated                  tracer methods to test the hypothesis that silicon limitation                   is a prerequisite for the mass flocculation of diatom blooms.                                                                                                   Recent evidence from a Gulf Stream warm-core ring suggests that                 the depletion of silicic acid from the euphotic zone is also                    accompanied by a shift in the source of silicic acid supporting                 silica production.  Before depletion, silica production is                      supported mainly by \"new\" silicic acid entrained from deeper                    waters.  Upon nutrient depletion, there is a shift to a heavy                   reliance on \"regenerated\" silicic acid derived from the local                   dissolution of siliceous particles. They propose to examine                     whether this transition occurs in more productive waters and to                 establish its relationship to the vertical flux of silicon and                  carbon.",
