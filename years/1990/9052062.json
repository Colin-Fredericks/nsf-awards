 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Department of Chemistry acquired a FTIR,              HPLC, and Atomic Absorption and UV-Visible spectrometers.  These                systems are computer accessed and controlled.  The use and                      application of the instrumentation affects all students within the              science division.  The project is designed specifically to improve              the science instruction capabilities of the institution, and                    strengthen and upgrade the instrumental analysis and physical                   chemistry laboratories. Students' experiences in instrumental                   methods, their knowledge of modern analytical techniques, and their             laboratory skills have been greatly enhanced by this project.  The              project has aided in increasing the instrumental emphasis in                    certain coursed, the depth and scope of experimentation in others,              and the students' knowledge of computer interface.  The project has             also provided students with hands-on experience in basic                        spectroscopy.  The institution has contributed to this project in               an amount equal to the NSF funds.",
