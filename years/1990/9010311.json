 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roughness measurements of solid surfaces, such as thin films                    and machined metals, at microscales and nanoscales show that                    the surfaces are rough and disordered over several decades of                   length scales.  Similar features have been observed in                          turbulent fluid interfaces.  Such disordered structures                         strongly influence thermal phenomena at interfaces.  Previous                   studies on thermal phenomena at such interfaces have                            conventionally made either oversimplifying idealizations of                     smoothness of an interface or resorted to empirical and semi-                   empirical methods of analysis.  This lack of physical                           understanding of the phenomena was mainly due to an inability                   to quantify the disorder in these structures.  This study                       proposes to use the novel concepts of fractal geometry to                       understand and characterize the fundamental nature of                           disordered surfaces.  Such a characterization quantifies the                    structure of surfaces at every length scale within certain                      limits.  This is particularly important in providing key                        insight into the interactions of thermal phenomena with                         interfaces at relevant length scales.  Preliminary studies on                   applying fractals in contact conductance have explained                         several previous experimental results.  Based on these                          encouraging prospects, this study proposes to use fractals to                   study interfacial thermal phenomena of scientific and                           engineering importance such as contact conductance, frictional                  heating, and interactions of radiation with surfaces.",
