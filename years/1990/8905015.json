 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study focuses on detailed geological-pedological                            characterization of the pre-Woodfordian paleosols in Indiana,                   with emphasis on the Sangamon Soil.  Pre-Sangamonian paleosols                  will also be investigated.  Although there are numerous excellent               exposures of paeosols in Indiana, comprehensive descriptions and                characterizations are uncommon, especially from a pedological                   viewpoint, except in the southwestern part of the state.  Far                   less is known about paleosols in Indiana than in other midwestern               states such as Illinois and Iowa.  However, the state is                        geologically well located so that the proposed study can include                paleosols developed from different parent materials, under                      different topographic, and therefore drainage, conditions                       (paleocatenas), and over as great a range of latitude as                        possible, in order to possibly evaluate differences due to                      paleoclimate.  In the context of our knowledge of paeosols in the               midcontinent, the study should contribute to understanding of                   sedimentological and erosional histories with respect to                        pedological history, especially in \"two-story\" or \"multiple-                    story\" paleosols often marked by lithologic and/or pedologic                    discontinuities.  Also to be considered are the effects of                      diagenesis, definition of glacial/interglacial boundaries and                   stratigraphic correlation, relative degrees of development of                   paleosols, and applications such as the siting of waste-disposal                facilities.  The objectives of the study will be achieved through               a combination of field investigation, laboratory analysis, and                  dating.  All investigations will be conducted in the context of                 the soil profile.",
