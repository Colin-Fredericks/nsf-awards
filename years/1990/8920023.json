This is a pervasive                  Nukulaelae speech event, and one which provides a special insight               into some key aspects of language use, including gender differ-                 ences in communicative style, covertness and indirection in dis-                course, and the role of prosody in encoding affect in language.                                                                                                 The investigator will be in the field for approximately six                     months.  He will make recordings of gossip interactions, to                     enlarge and complement a preliminary data base gathered during                  previous field sojourns.  These recordings will be transcribed                  and analyzed with a focus on linguistic and discourse devices                   that are privileged for the encoding of affective meaning.                      Explanatory correlations will be sought between the form and                    function of these affect-encoding devices and how Nukulaelae                    conceptualize gossip settings, emotional behavior in these                      settings, and presentation of self.                                                                                                                             This project brings together several strands of research:  the                  linguistic study of the role of affect in discourse; the form and               function of gossip interactions in the linguistic repertoire of a               speech community; psychological anthropological concerns with                   ethnotheories of the person and emotion; and the sociocultural                  anthropological study of the function of gossip in society.",
