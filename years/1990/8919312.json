 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the design and manufacturing of VLSI systems, practical problems are         often characterized by fixed parameter instances.  For example, such a          parameter may represent the number of tracks permitted on a chip or the         load capacity of a communications link.  By fixing such parameters,             attention can be focused on the physically realizable nature of the             system rather than abstract aspects.  Research is concentrated on               fixed-parameter algorithmic and combinatorial problems of IC design.            Powerful and, in some cases, emergent techniques from the fields of             complexity theory, graph theory, well-partial-order theory, and                 algebraic coding theory are being used in considering such pragmatic            issues as circuit layout, arrangement, embedding, and routing.  A               second thrust is the general problem of organizing and utilizing large          collections of processors working in concert.  Thus problems of system          organization, utilization, mapping, and emulation are being addressed.          The proposed research is on IC design theory, and is important to our           understanding of the IC design process and methodology.  The Principal          Investigators are recognized as expert researchers in this area, have a         history of novel ideas, and the potential to continue producing good            research.  They have done outstanding research during the first two             years of the grant.  This has resulted in fifteen papers published in           the archival literature (refereed journals), ten being refereed, and            many in conference proceedings and books.                                                                                                                       RESULT FROM PRIOR NSF SUPPORT                                                   Reviewers were uniformly very positive about the results from prior NSF         support.  They said the research results were of quality and had                already made an impact on the IC theory community.  It is clear that            the prior support permitted development of the ideas leading to this            proposal.",
