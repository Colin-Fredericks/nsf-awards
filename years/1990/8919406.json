 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                     chemistry and in the subfield of organometallic surface                         chemistry.  Professor Robert Madix will study the chemical                      reactions of hydrocarbon and alcohol molecules with well                        defined single crystal active metal surfaces (e.g. iron and                     silver).  The classes of reactions under study are important                    models for complex homogeneous metal catalyzed organic                          chemistry.  These studies will provide information about the                    reaction rates and structures of the reactants, intermediates                   and products formed during model reactions.  Fundamental                        information about the role of molecular structure and metal                     surface chemistry will help provide general principles of                       catalytic reactions.                                                                                                                                            The carbon monoxide promoted hydrogenation of alkenes over iron                 catalysts and \u01314+2! cycloadditions catalyzed on silver surfaces                 will be the two systems under study.  Vibrational spectroscopy,                 thermal desorption reaction mass spectrometry, work function                    and photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to study structure                  and kinetics of carbon monoxide-ethylene coadsorbed on iron                     (100) and butadiene reactions on silver (110), copper (110) and                 palladium (111) surfaces.  The effects of orientational changes                 of reactants on their reactivity will be examined by                            vibrational spectroscopy and near edge x-ray absorption fine                    structure.",
