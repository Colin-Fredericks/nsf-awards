 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Harter is supported by a grant from The Theoretical                   and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his research in                 developing methods for the interpretation of complex                            rotation-vibration spectra of gas phase molecules.  This                        research provides an important link between experimental                        spectroscopic data, and a detailed understanding of the                         structure and internal dynamics of complex molecular species.                                                                                                   Professor Harter has developed a new visual approach to the                     interpretation of complex rotational spectra which he calls the                 rotational energy (RE) surface.  The symmetries of the                          molecular states and their quantum wavefunctions are related to                 classical motion in the neighborhood of various RE surface                      fixed points.  The goal of this research project is to apply                    the RE surface methods to a wider class of molecules, ions, and                 clusters to understand their transitions and dynamics in the                    presence of external perturbations.  Current applications of                    these methods include the analysis of molecules of icosahedral                  symmetry, including a hypothetical giant carbon-cluster of 60                   carbon atoms known as Buckminsterfullerene.",
