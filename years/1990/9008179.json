 "awd_abstract_narration": "The manner and mechanisms by which the human brain has                     developed its enormous relative size and intricate mode of                      patterning is one of the most fundamental questions in physical                 anthropology.  Traditionally, the brain was thought to have first               enlarged in response to, and concomitantly with, earliest human                 tool fabrication.  It is now known, however, that human tools                   show up in the fossil record long before brain enlargement, and                 other theories have subsequently been offered to explain this                   uniquely human characteristic.  This investigator explains brain                enlargement as an indirect result of changes in cerebral blood                  flow and seeks to test two related hypotheses about the pattern                 of blood flow in hominoids.  These hypotheses can be tested by                  examination of the interior of skulls, because the pattern of                   meningeal blood vessels provides an indelible imprint on the                    interior of the skull.  The first hypothesis is that the                        branching pattern of middle meningeal blood vessels distinguishes               between the two types of australopithecine fossil.  The second is               that a \"strong\" branching pattern correlates with larger cranial                capacity.  The latter hypothesis will be tested on a large number               of human and ape skulls to determine the nature of the                          correlation between cranial capacity and blood vessel branching                 pattern in higher primates including humans.  The research will                 provide further evidence regarding the \"radiator\" theory of brain               enlargement, whereby bigger brains are claimed to be                            characterized by a more complicated network of vessels than                     smaller brains.",
