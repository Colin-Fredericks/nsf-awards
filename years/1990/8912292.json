 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Antoni W.H. Damman of the University of             Connecticut to conduct collaborative research with Dr. K. Ito of the            University of Hokkaido and Dr. S. Kojima of Toyama University in                Japan.  The project will include an eight-month stay in Japan by                Dr. Damman.  Fundamental questions of decay, nitrogen dynamics and              element retention in peat bogs will be studied.                                                                                                                 The peat bogs in northern Japan are particularly suitable for this              project because they exist in the form of stratified structures of              alternating peat and volcanic ash layers.  In addition to the                   chronological control the stratification permits, the peat also shows           the effects of volcanic ash over hundreds of years.  The effects of             nutrient additions to the peat in the years between volcanic erup-              tions, as well as those of sulfur and phosphorus additions during the           eruptions, will be studied by layer core measurements as well as                atomic absorption spectrophotometry.  The experience of the Japanese            laboratories in ongoing studies of native bogs and mires will                   complement that of the Principal Investigator in vegetation analysis            and the study of vegetation-soil relationships.",
