 "awd_abstract_narration": "While implementing temporal data models can dramatically increase               the expressive power of a database management system (DBMS),                    processing efficiency is critical to its success. The potentially               enormous sizes of historical data, coupled with the complexity of               many temporal operators, pose challenges to the practical                       implementation of a temporal DBMS. In this project, key issues                  related to the optimization of temporal database processing are                 investigated. The focus of the work is on joins which are found                 in the most common and costly queries. Optimization algorithms                  for the various join operators, data organizations, and data                    structures are be developed. An essential component of the                      optimization process is estimating the size of intermediate                     results. Temporal relations are distinct from snapshot ones, and                conventional estimation techniques are inadequate. Consequently,                a new mathematical approach to estimating selectivities for                     temporal data need be developed. As part of this project the                    alternative algorithms are first be simulated and analyzed. Then                two prototypes (one on top of an existing relational DBMS, while                the other is a direct implementation of important temporal                      operators) are built to further evaluate the optimization                       concepts. The results of this research will have an impact on                   database technology by providing a methodology for development of               efficient temporal database systems.",
