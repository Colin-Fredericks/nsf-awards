 "awd_abstract_narration": "An extensive collection of decapod crustaceans was made on James                Ross Island, Antarctica, which provides the first record of this                fossil fauna from Baremmian into Campanian age rocks in the                     southern high latitudes.  This time span is particularly                        important because several genera with living descendants may have               evolved at this time in the Antarctic region.  New taxa are also                represented in the collections which will make it possible to                   examine several aspects of paleobiology.  In addition to                        description and classification of the new species, it will be                   possible to determine the amount of morphological variation                     within at least two species that are now documented to have                     existed over a 20 million year time span.  Currently these                      species seem to show remarkably little change with time.  It is                 also probable that some of the new taxa will represent founder                  species within genera that have subsequently become more widely                 dispersed.  These specimens, combined with those collected from                 New Zealand, will provide information on the early history of a                 diverse, deep water, group of decapods that are currently widely                dispersed throughout the world.",
