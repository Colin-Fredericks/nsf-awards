 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geology department is integrating field geophysics into the field           component of lower and upper division courses with emphasis on the use          of geophysical data as a tool for problem solving. A gravity meter,             magnetometer and portable computer are being acquired to meet four              goals: 1. exposure of all geology majors and a majority of physics              majors to geophysical field techniques, 2. enhancement of undergraduate         research opportunities, 3. year-round use of the equipment, and 4.              limited use by non-majors in demonstration settings and exhibits. The           equipment is being used in a new lower division course in Field Methods         as an exercise in quantitative data acquisition, contouring and                 mapping. It is used in the Structural Geology course to study offsets           in the Balcones fault zone or to model a salt dome. Use in the                  Geophysics course emphasizes processing and modelling methods. Students         participate in planning of surveys and prepare a comprehensive report           on the analysis techniques and results. It is also used for several             surveys on the yearly Majors Field Trip, as a demonstration tool in the         Oceanography course, and in an exhibit monitoring Earth tides. The              university will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
