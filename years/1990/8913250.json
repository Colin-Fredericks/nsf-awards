 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a long-term visit by Professor Galen R.                 Shorack of the University of Washington to the Universita Degli                 Studi di Roma in Italy, to collaborate with Professors Gabriella                Salinetti and Giorgio Koch of that institution.  The researchers                intend to investigate a broad class of statistical limit theorems               that are of fundamental importance in the theory of empirical                   processes.  There are at least two major approaches based on the                so-called Skorokhod and Hungarian constructions.  The PI has                    fundamentally simplified one of these approaches by showing that a              properly formulated result yields classical necessary and sufficient            condition types of statistical limit theorems.  The proof depends               only on standard second moment inequalities as opposed to the                   current delicate exponential bound techniques.  Moreover, there is              a natural mechanism by which the so-called weighted empirical                   process can be embedded.  Additionally, newly discovered second                 moment techniques can be applied here also, to again yield a best               possible rate of embedding result.  This greatly expands the scope              of application to statistical procedures.  Thus, where reasonable               conditions for limiting results are known, it will now be possible              to determine both necessary and sufficient conditions.                                                                                                          The Italian collaborators are also currently active in the field of             empirical processes although they approach the subject from                     different but complementary directions.  Thus the proposed                      interaction should be of mutual benefit and should help to advance              the area of empirical processes.  ***//",
