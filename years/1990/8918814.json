 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with developing models to aid                   decisions about the trade-offs between competing telecommunications             technologies and the services offered through them.  The work is                particularly concerned with planning models for communications                  satellites.  This work is part of a larger study of technological               and market factors on the cost effectiveness of terrestrial and                 satellite communications systems in competitive environments.  It               aims to develop quantitative tools to manage the development and                operation of such systems.  The models under study in this research             relate to decision on key technical parameters, performance                     requirements, types of communications service is to be offered, the             volume of each type of service to be carried on the system and the              price to be charged.  The work will develop the mathematical models,            develop efficient solution methods for them, test and validate them             with available data, and design a user interface with access to a               database of economic and technical information.  The work is                    significant for increasing our understanding of the interplay                   between a variety of technical and economic factors in making                   choices about expensive, long lived telecommunications assets and               the services they will be capable of providing.",
