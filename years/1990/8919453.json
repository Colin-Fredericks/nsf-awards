 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists have discovered a number of parallels between speech                 development in humans and song development in birds.  These                     parallels include learning early in life, and speaking two                      languages or singing two song types at dialect boundaries.                                                                                                      White-crowned sparrows learn songs from adults in the population.               Cultural tradition and isolation gives rise to regional dialects.               In the laboratory, white-crowned sparrows will learn song from                  tape recorders before they are 50 days of age, but the stronger                 stimulus of a live, interacting tutor is necessary for song                     learning beyond that age.  The present studies were designed to                 find out if young birds learn songs from neighbors after leaving                their birthplace (at the age of 50 days) and settling, and if                   subordinate individuals tend to learn songs from dominant                       individuals.  Dr. Baptista will also investigate whether or not                 nonmigratory individuals develop songs faster than migratory                    individuals, since sedentary birds establish territories at an                  earlier age and song has important functions in acquiring and                   maintaining a territory.                                                                                                                                        Singing and territoriality are two of many behaviors birds need                 in order to survive.  Knowledge of how birds interact with their                physical and social environment is prerequisite to any                          intelligent management program to save our vanishing habitat and                wildlife.",
