 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Laird will collaborate on this joint project with Dr. Bruce                 Carney at the University of North Carolina to begin four new                    observational programs which are dedicated to studies of the disk               and outer halo of our Galaxy and to the Large Magellanic Cloud.                 (1) Several thousand dwarf stars will be identified in selected                 directions in the Galactic plane to determine the local density                 ratio of thin disk and thick disk populations of stars.  (2) The                outer disk of our Galaxy will be studied for information relevant               to the formation timescale of the disk and for chemical and                     kinematic information about the outer disk.  (3) The metallicities              of red giant stars in globular clusters in the outer halo of our                Galaxy and of dwarf spheroidal galaxies will be determined.  (4)                Metallicities and radial velocities of about 1000 giant stars in                the Large Magellanic Cloud will be determined.  This will reveal                the history of the chemistry and kinematics of the older stars in               the Large Magellanic Cloud.  These principal investigators will                 also compute synthetic spectra for cooler stars and lower gravity               stars in order to derive the mean matallicities from high                       resolution spectra obtained from observations.",
