 "awd_abstract_narration": "Processes responsible for the mosaic of hemlock stands and                 hardwood stands in the old-growth forest at Sylvania, Michigan                  will be studied with retrospective techniques.  These approaches                include reconstruction of disturbance history over the last two                 centuries from tree-rings, windstorms, fire and the consequent                  changes in forest composition over the last five millennia from                 pollen deposits in small forest hollows.  The mosaic of stands                  and soil textures will be studied in three permanent plots                      established on different soil types.  The ways in which the                     mosaic changed through time in response to climatic change, to                  changes in disturbance regimes and to the invasion of hemlock                   beginning three thousand years ago, will be monitored by pollen                 diagrams from closely spaced spatial arrays of hollows,                         approximately one per hectare, within each of the plots.  Mosaic                changes on a large spatial scale will be shown in pollen diagrams               from seven additional hollows scattered throughout Sylvania in                  stand types not represented in the plots.  Modeling and studies                 of pollen representation will develop needed techniques for                     accurate interpretation of pollen assemblages from heterogeneous                vegetation.",
