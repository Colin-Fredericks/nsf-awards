 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will explain how different types of living arran-                    gements affect future education, employment, and earnings of                    teenaged mothers.  Most previous research highlights the negative               impact of teenaged child bearing on women's economic status.                    However new findings reported by researchers at the University of               Pennsylvania who have followed more than 400 teenaged mothers for               2 years show that many teenaged mothers break out of poverty by                 the time they reach midlife.  This study hypothesizes that the                  types of households in which teenaged mothers live during adoles-               cence is an important determinant of which among them are abler                 to complete their education, find steady jobs, and become self-                 sufficient adult.  Data for this study come from a 1979-1988                    nationally representative survey that has interviewed several                   thousand young people of both sexes annually from adolescence                   through their 20s.  This study is significant because it will                   show which types of living arrangements promote or inhibit                      economic independence following parenthood.  It will show the                   importance of social supports in shaping the lives of young                     mothers.  Findings will increase understanding of the household                 structures of young women who are disproportionately at risk of                 becoming welfare dependent.",
