 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invertebrate nervous systems are structurally less elaborate               than those of vertebrates.  This simplicity along with the                      accessibility of their nervous system have permitted detailed                   electrophysiological and morphological studies resulting in the                 construction of functional circuit diagrams.  Dr. Stretton has                  used  Ascaris summ, a large nematode parasite of pigs, as a model               system to understand the neural circuits controlling locomotion.                Their relatively simple movements are coordinated by a motor                    nervous system that contains approximately 77 neurons distributed               within the ventral nerve cord along the length of the worm.  He                 has found that along with the classic neurotransmitters that                    operate within the nematode nervous system are a large number of                immunoreactive neuropeptide-like substances.  These data indicate               that previously unknown elaborate communication system exists in                these simple organisms similar to that reported in more complex                 animals.  Dr. Stretton along with Dr. Wright, his postdoctoral                  fellow, will isolate, clone, and sequence the gene that encodes                 two bioactive neuropeptides.  Since each neuropeptide is a                      potentially potent chemical messenger with unique target-                       responses, they will characterize which motor nervous system                    neurons are likely to express individual peptides.  The results                 obtained using this simple system will enhance our understanding                of the neurochemical basis of locomotion and its coordination.                  Moreover, studies on the basic neurobiology of nematodes may                    provide a rational basis for the design of controls on these                    parasites found in man, domesticated animals and cultivated                     plants.",
