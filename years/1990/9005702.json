 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rats and mice of the South American murid rodent radiation                 (the largely endemic subfamily Sigmodontinae) represent a very                  large array of organisms that range in morphologic adaptations                  from subfossorial to aquatic to arborel and in habitat from                     tropical rainforest of the Amazon Basin to puna grassland in the                highest elevations of the Andes.  This adaptive radiation                       comprises some 70 genera, most of which are commonly divided into               one of five major lineages.  Among these, the akodontines are                   among the most diverse and oldest, with fossils of modern forms                 extending back some 6 million years in Argentina.  Despite the                  widely recognized diversification of this lineage, most taxa are                both poorly known and defined, and phylogenetic, ecologic, and                  life history aspects of their biology are either totally unknown                or only barely so.  This is particularly true for the akodontine                group, a radiation of some 15 genera and about 50 species largely               confined to grassland habitats from the northern Andes to the                   Patagonian steppes.  The present research will utilize DNA                      sequences, obtained from several genes within the mithochrondrial               genome by the technique of the Polymerase Chain Reaction, to                    address the following set of general goals:  (1) establish an                   hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among all genera and                   most species of the complex; (2) perform a text of the model of                 species formation resulting from divergence across strong habitat               gradients, using selected species inhabiting the steep eastern                  slope of the Andes as exemplars; and (3) determine whether or not               particular cranial conformations that identify highly derived                   taxa within this assemblage share a close common ancestor or                    whether this type of cranial structure has evolved repeatedly in                separate lineages.  The exciting aspect of this research is that,               since DNA can be extracted and amplified from dried skin                        specimens already preserved within natural history collections,                 now extinct or exceedingly rare taxa can be compared in ways                    never before available.  Five of the genera of concern, for                     example, are each known form very few specimens, most of which                  only collected once from very remote areas.  This is, therefore,                the first study of relationships within the group to examine all                extant taxa in a comparative way.",
