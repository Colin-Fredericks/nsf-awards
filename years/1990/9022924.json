The Center has been in operation for             six and one half years, in fully compliance with I/UCRC guidelines.             The Center has been active in a number of research areas including:             (1) The electrokinetic behavior of particles in liquids used in                 etch baths, (2) Particle detection and formation in vacuum systems,             (3) The detection and control of electrostatic discharge in                     production situations, (4) The detection and evaluation of                      particles using electromagnetics scattering, and (5) The modeling               of Cleanroom Aerosol Dynamics.  The quality of the Center has also              been recognized by others.  The expertise in the Center was                     instrumental in the award of a SEMATECH Center in the area of                   Contamination and Defect Control to the University of Arizona.                  This Center complements the activities of the I/UCRC.                                The Program Manager recommends that the University of Arizona              I/UCRC for Microcontamination Control be awarded $30,000 per year               for three years for a Self-Sufficient Industry/University                       Cooperative Research Center Partnership.",
