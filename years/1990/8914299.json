 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with a research program on separations                       processes, including experimental and theoretical work on low                   pressure vapor-liquid equilibrium.  It is related to group                      contribution activity coefficient prediction methods, and high                  pressure phase equilibrium for the development of better                        equations of state and their mixing rules.  The project covers                  the range of conditions in gas and oil processing,                              supercritical extraction, enhanced oil recovery by gas                          injection, and other elevated pressure processes.                                                                                                               There are several unique features of the proposed work.                         First, the experimental work will be on systems specially                       chosen to critically test current equation of state and                         activity coefficient models, not merely to fill voids in data                   banks.  Second, by the choice of systems and conditions, these                  data will also be of direct industrial interest for process                     design and development.  Third, the project will explore the                    use of molecular mechanics and ab initio quantum mechanical                     calculations to identify nearest neighbor interference                          effects, in order to improve shortcomings of current group                      contribution methods.  This work will represent the first use                   of quantum chemistry in molecular thermodynamics and has the                    potential for greatly improving process design predictions in                   the absence of experimental data.  Finally, cooperative                         research with the Technical University of Berlin and Denmark,                   and the University of Paris will continue.  In the past, this                   cooperation has resulted in visits and the exchange of                          students, faculty and equipment between the various                             laboratories.",
