 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question raised by A. Calderon in 1980 asks                  whether or not one can determine the conductivity of a body from                knowledge of steady state direct current measurements at the                    boundary.  This problem has attracted much attention in the past                few years and forms the basis for work to be done on this                       project.                                                                             The mathematical model of conductivity is a nonlinear                      elliptic differential operator, defined in a domain in a space of               any dimension, with prescribed boundary values.  The boundary                   values are viewed as the induced voltage potential; the solution                as the resulting potential inside the domain.  This is a standard               partial differential equation.  The real problem occurs when one                does not have the boundary potential but instead is given the                   current flux density across the boundary.  This is a quantity                   which can actually be measured in the physical world.                                Significant progress has been made in this area in the case                of domains of dimension three or greater, especially when there                 is considerable smoothness to the boundary.  In dimension two,                  the inverse problem is more difficult.  Good results are only                   available for conductivity which is close to constant.  The most                recent work in two dimensions will be continued in this project.                Mathematically, the problem consists of showing that the flux                   density and conductivity are in a one-one relationship.  What is                now known is that a local univalency implies global.  Actually,                 this only holds in a dense set of problems.  The work to be done                is to establish the local-global result in general and to                       determine methods for testing the local condition.",
