 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using a unique data set of ten spring-summer seasons, a                    series of hypotheses will be tested to define more precisely the                seasonal and interannual variability of snow melt, surface albedo               and late-summer ice extent, its climatic significance, and                      relationships with surface pressure fields and heights,                         temperature anomalies and other atmospheric indices. This will                  constitute an expansion of previous work under NSF support for 1)               an initial study of snow melt/climate interactions based on four                seasons (1977, 1979, 1984, 1985) of data and 2) the basic data                  set preparation only (no analysis) of six additional seasons                    (1975, 1978, 1980, 1986-1988).                                                       The analysis will be performed using digitized ten-season                  data sets of snow melt stages and parameterized surface albedo                  constructed from Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP)                imagery for May through mid-August and coincident sea ice and                   atmospheric data from other sources.                                                 The timing and extent of snow melt atop the Arctic pack ice                is an important climatic forcing factor of northern high                        latitudes, with implications for the long-term mass balance and                 stability of the ice and potential climatic impacts in other                    parts of the Northern Hemisphere.  It may also serve as an                      indicator of climatic change forced by increasing greenhouse gas                concentrations.",
