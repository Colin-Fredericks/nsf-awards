 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program is proposed to determine the scientific                      feasibility of a new type of broad area (>1000 cm2), high                       energy (>400 KeV) electron gun concept.  This plasma                            electron (PE) gun uses a plasma, which is generated at low                      gas pressure using a thin-wire cold-cathode discharge, as the                   dc source of electrons.  The extracted electrons are formed                     in beamlets which pass through a thin metal foil window, its                    support structure and into air with minimum losses.  The                        result is a new, innovative electron gun which is expected to                   offer substantial benefits, relative to other gun designs,                      including: (1) higher electrical efficiency (>85%); and (2)                     higher operating voltage (>400 kV); and (3) longer life                         (>10,000 hours) and (4) lower cost (<$4/Watt).  These                           attributes are critical for many environmental and industrial                   applications.                                                                   The Phase I effort will consist of the following three tasks:                   (1) design and construction of a 50 kV PE-gun apparatus; (2)                    experiments to determine the characteristics of the plasma                      generator and (3) measurement of the electron beam                              properties to investigate loss mechanisms and beam                              uniformity.  Successful completion of these tasks will provide                  a firm foundation for high voltage, high power experiments                      with a laboratory prototype PE-gun in Phase II.",
