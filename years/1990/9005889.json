This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support four research                       projects in  the Department of Mathematics of University of                     Houston.  The names of the investigators and the titles of their                projects follow:  Golubitsky and Melbourne, Bifurcation Theory                  and Dynamical Systems;  Auchmuty, Dean, Glowinski and Scott,                    Variational Methods in Mechanics;  Keyfitz, Sanders and Wagner,                 Computing Complex Flows Modeled by Conservation Laws; and                       Fajtlowicz, Automated Conjectures.",
