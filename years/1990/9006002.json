 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effect of floods on stream invertebrates has been the                  topic of a number of studies by stream ecologists.  Rapid re-                   establishment of populations following extreme floods is common                 yet we do not understand the mechanisms responsible for this                    recovery.  This pilot project will begin to test the hypothesis                 that debris dams lessen the detrimental effect of floods on                     stream meiofauna and that the effect of these mitigating patches                                                                                                (dam) will be greatest for those species with slowest                           reproductive rates.  Start up funds will be used to begin work to                                                                                               determine if faunal reproduction is rapid enough to account for                 recovery of populations following floods.  Additional development                                                                                               time will be invested in determining if the high abundances of                  fauna near debris dams are linked to flood events.  This study                  will begin to provide data on the mechanisms determining which                  species of stream invertebrates persist at a given locale over                  time, and pave the way for longer project which will                            experimentally examine the interplay of dispersal, reproduction                 and patch dynamics.",
