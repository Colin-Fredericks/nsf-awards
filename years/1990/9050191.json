 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our objective is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a                   video-based problem solving series that generates excitement                    about mathematics and science among middle school students                      (grades 5,6,7) and that helps them develop powerful skills of                   mathematical problem formulation and problem solving.  The                      series will consist of (1) six problem solving videos that                      cover the key mathematical concepts and activities recommended                  for middle school mathematics in the NCTM curriculum standards                  (1989); (2) ancillary materials in the form of print,                           Hypermedia and computer tools that help students carry their                    mathematical thinking to other parts of the curriculum such as                  science and social studies; (3) teaching videos plus text                       materials for teachers.                                                                                                                                              The series will be based on a theoretically and                            empirically motivated set of design principles that help                        teachers engage in the types of classroom activities that are                   recommended in the NCTM curriculum standards.  Several of these                 design principles are unique to our proposed series and appear                  to be extremely important for enhancing motivation among                        students and developing powerful skills of complex problem                      formulation and problem solving.                                                                                                                                     We have already produced two problem solving videos that                   serve as pilots for the series (one is included with this                       application) and are currently producing a teaching video plus                  ancillary materials to accompany the pilots.  We are asking the                 NSF for help in producing the four additional problem solving                   videos (plus ancillary materials) plus the two additional                       teaching videos.  We discuss the anticipated impact of our                      series, our previous track record and our plans for quality                     control, cost-sharing and dissemination.",
