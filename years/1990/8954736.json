 "awd_abstract_narration": "CUNY City College will establish a program of recruitment,                      orientation, and retention of students interested in pursuing a                 career in Secondary Science and Mathematics Teaching.  The                      program will focus on attracting students who have interest and                 ability in science but had not considered teaching as a career                  and supporting these students through their freshman year, a                    period in which the attrition rate is highest.  The project                     director intends to submit another proposal later addressing                    the program beyond the freshman year.  The program will place                   heavy emphasis on establishing contacts with the high schools                   in New York City to inform students, especially minority                        students, about careers in science and mathematics teaching.                    Those students not ready for the rigors of college-level course                 work will be given the opportunity to participate in a                          preparatory semester to strengthen academic skills, increase                    confidence, and become oriented to college life.  This                          preparatory semester will include an integrated laboratory                      science course, a pre-calculus course, a writing course, and an                 orientation seminar, all in a participatory, non-threatening                    atmosphere.  There will be a major emphasis in the preparatory                  semester on developing problem-solving and study skills in a                    setting of peer group support.  The regular freshman                            mathematics and science courses will be restructured to bring                   them into concurrence with the philosophy of the project, and                   there will be weekly tutorial sessions to reinforce the                         learning in these courses.   A freshman seminar will be held                    weekly that will focus on helping students understand and meet                  the demands of college life, cultivate dialogue between                         students and faculty, and bring in guest speakers to talk about                 the teaching profession and encourage students to persist in                    achieving their goals.                                                                                                                                          CUNY City College will contribute 82% of NSF's amount as cost-                  sharing.",
