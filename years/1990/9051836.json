 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to improve instruction in four different             courses that utilize the Materials Testing Laboratory.  The equipment           includes an Automatic Testing System, and Electro-Mechanical Testing            System, troptometers, strain gauge, and various fixtures.  The                  microprocessor-based Automatic Testing System upgrades the existing             200,000 lb. Universal Tester to state of the art as found by                    graduates in high tech industries in the area.  The Electro-                    Mechanical Testing System extends the capability of the laboratory              into polymers, ceramics and composite testing in keeping with the               growing importance of these to surrounding industries and research              centers.  Experiments taking advantage of these new capabilities are            incorporated the curriculum of several different degree programs. The           award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                    investigator's institution.",
