Dr. Block will                        continue his studies on the chemistry of the organic compounds                  of sulfur.  Major areas of concern include the development of                   useful new sulfur-containing reagents for organic synthesis,                    the investigation of the structure, synthesis and reactions of                  unusual organosulfur compounds from onion and the study of                      important but little studied classes of organosulfur compounds.                                                                                                 A novel class of reagents that permit the controlled growth of                  carbon-containing rings through \"iterative Diels-Alder                          reactions\" will be studied.  Syntheses will be attempted that                   will afford polyacenes, compounds that are linear molecules                     containing side-by-side fused benzene rings, which, in the                      polymer (C4H2)n extreme, have been predicted to be electrical                   conductors.  Related reagents will be used to develop a new                     synthesis of fused cyclopentadienes and a novel, catalytic                      process for the generation and trapping of singlet disulfur.",
