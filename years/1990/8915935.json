 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fish have served as objects of experimental research for several                centuries, however their role as an experimental model, which can               substitute for conventional laboratory warmblooded animals has been             enhanced particularly in recent times.  Representative agnathans                (lamprey or hagfish) and teleost fish (salmon, trout, catfish) are to           be used in studies of the regulation of metabolism and growth by                pancreatic hormones, their interaction with each other and with growth          hormone and insulin-like growth factor.  Specific objectives of the             project are:  1) to develop new homologous radioimmunoassays or enzyme-         linked immunoassays for measurement of the islet hormones in lampreys;          2) to continue an assessment of the profiles of pancreatic hormones in          plasma and endocrine pancreas of salmon, trout and lamprey at different         stages of their life cycles and kept under different feeding regimes;           3) to determine the levels of pancreatic hormones in the blood outflow          from the pancreatic islets (major producing sites) and from the liver,          (important target and main place for destruction of the pancreatic              hormones); to evaluate the differences in the hormonal contents in              fasting and feeding animals with respect to these patterns;  4) to              examine whether the cells from different parts of liver, encountering           different levels of hormones are metabolically differentiated and to            employ isolated hepatocytes as an experimental in vitro system for              investigation of the effects of glucagon-family peptides, which                 regulate energy stores;  5) to study specific binding of the major              anabolic hormone, insulin to its target, the liver, at different                developmental stages and under different feeding regimes;  6) to                investigate whether the unusual abundance of \"big\" somatostatins in the         endocrine pancreas of lamprey and salmon has any particular                     physiological significance.  The expected results will contribute to            better understanding of hormonal regulation of nutrition and growth as          well as extend our knowledge of functional evolution of pancreatic              hormones in vertebrates.",
