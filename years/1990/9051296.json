 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is implementing the use of the infrared spectrometer               and the computer in both the chemistry classroom and                            laboratories.  Activities include the use of the IR spectrometer                to analyze organic compounds prepared by students, the use of the               IR to enhance students' understanding of infrared spectroscopy,                 and the use of the computer to collect, analyze, and store                      infrared spectra data obtained by the students, as well as                      information obtained through the use of the gas chromatograph and               various chemical experiments.  The computer is also used in the                 classroom for simulations.                                                                                                                                      The project has significantly upgraded the organic chemistry                    program by introducing routine use of the IR spectrometer and                   computer.  It has allowed students to become better acquainted                  with the sophistication level of laboratory work and research,                  and has improved the educational process of the entire chemistry                program.                                                                                                                                                        The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
