 "awd_abstract_narration": "New and innovative techniques for software development are needed to            improve productivity and enhance  reliability.  Object-Oriented                 development offers the greatest potential for achieving these goals.            However, Object-Oriented techniques have not been widely applied across         all stages of the development lifecycle and Object-Oriented CASE tools          are not widely available.  A simple methodology, based upon Object-             Oriented techniques and supporting development through evolution is             needed. In this research a series of building blocks will be developed          that can be used to incrementally construct a prototype environment             which supports Object-Oriented, iterative development.  To develop              these building blocks, existing Object-Oriented tools and a spiral              lifecycle in which several prototype environments are developed will be         used.  Thus, this project aims to evolve Object-Oriented technology and         spiral development so that a production quality, high productivity              environment can ultimately be produced.",
