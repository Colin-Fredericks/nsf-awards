 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate children's memory for their                       everyday experiences, such as going to school.  Two types of                    memory will be investigated: (1) script memory and (2) episodic                 memory.  Script memory refers to an abstract general memory for                 the typical activities that occur during routine events (e.g.,                  eating at a restaurant).  Episodic memory refers to memory for a                specific event episode.  The research will address three specific               interrelated questions.  The first is the role of script memory                 in facilitating episodic memory.  Of interest are the conditions                under which children remember specific episodes of a repeated                   event.  For example, it has been argued that episodic memories                  are established only when a particular experience deviates                      substantially from the typical scripted event.  Whether an                      episode is perceived as different depends on several factors,                   such as event complexity, similarity to other event experiences,                and the frequency of experiences.  To determine how these                       conditions function, the research will use novel, artificial                    events created for children to experience.  This will provide                   systematic control of these factors.   Second, the research will                use the same sorts of events to examine how these same elements                 contribute to script memory development.  Of interest is whether                differences in event experience will produce different levels of                script abstraction.  Second, the studies will examine whether                   there are developmental differences between younger and older                   children on how much they depend on scripts to form an episodic                 memory.  That is, are younger children more likely than older                   children to falsely report typical script activities when                       recalling an episodic event. even when that activity did not                    occur during that particular episode?  These studies will                       investigate the conditions (i.e., the complexity, frequency and                 similarity of events) in which script dependency occurs.  Of                    interest is whether the degree of script dependency can be                      altered in both older and younger children under these different                event conditions.                                                                                                                                               Results of this research will have implications both for                        education and for the judicial system.  First, by examining the                 conditions under which children form different types of memories,               it will be possible to create learning experiences to facilitate                the acquisition of different educational concepts that are more                 appropriate for either script or episodic memory.  Second, this                 research will provide much needed information on the accuracy of                children's memory.  This information is important for questions                 regarding children's eyewitness testimony in cases of physical                  and sexual abuse.  In many of these cases, children are often                   called to testify about repeated events that took place over an                 extended period of time.",
