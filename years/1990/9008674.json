 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Career Paths for Minority Students program is a                     cooperative effort administered by the University of California,                Riverside Graduate Division.  It is designed to attract up to 25                students over a five year period from 15 different academic                     disciplines in the sciences and social sciences.  It allows them to             choose from over 64 ongoing research projects and provides                      encouragement to pursue research or university careers.  Support                is provided from the summer of their junior year through three years            of graduate school with the promise of continued support until                  the completion of a Ph.D. at UCR.  Two summer programs following                a student's junior and senior years are intensive research                      mentorships and preparation for graduate school.  Senior year                   research traineeships allow further experience and mentoring from               faculty and graduate students.  Upon entry into graduate school at              UCR, the student receives three years of fellowship support, including          fees and a research/travel allowance.",
