 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Cheuk-Yiu Ng is supported by a grant from the                         Experimental Physical Program. He is studying single molecule,                  or ion, dissociations originating from collisions with other                    similar kinds of species.  These species are of a somewhat                      different nature than he has studied previously and he will,                    therefore, also be constructing some new equipment in order to                  accomplish his objectives.                                                                                                                                      More specifically, Professor Ng will be studying unimolecular                   decomposition, collision-induced dissociation and reaction                      dynamics of internal energy selected cluster ions such as the                   positive  species from argon, xenon, water, ammonia and several                 others as well.  By measuring the kinetic energy distribution                   of fragment ions absolute state to state decay rates can be                     inferred, thus allowing us to gain greater insight into the                     bonding and energetics of cluster ions.",
