The purpose of this program is to identify high achieving middle school         and high school students with the potential and interest in becoming            engineers or scientists and to reinforce them in the pursuit of these           fields.  The project consists of an intense mathematics-based enrichment        program emphasizing the development of abstract reasoning skills and            problem-solving skills through coursework assignments, examinations and         laboratory projects.  A career awareness component involves guest               speakers in science and engineering, as well as field trips.  The               program staff consists of college teachers, outstanding high school             teachers, Air Force and Navy officers, and undergraduate engineering and        science majors as mentors.  Successful applicants are required to have a        \"B\" or better average in their current academic year and must maintain a        75+ average to remain in the program.",
