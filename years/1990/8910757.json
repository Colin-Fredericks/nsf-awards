 "awd_abstract_narration": "In holometablous insects the pattern of gene expression in many                 tissues changes dramatically at the metamorphic molt. The larval                fat body cells in Galleria mellonella synthesize several larval                 hemolymph proteins but after metamorphosis into pupa these fat                  body cells cease synthesis of these proteins. The same fat body                 cells synthesize vitellogenins in pharate adult females. Dr.                    Kumaran has showed that Lhp76 is expressed all through larval                   life whenever ecdysteroid titers are low and that Lhp82 is                      expressed during the period when both ecdysteroid and juvenile                  hormone titers are low or undetectable. Northern analysis showed                that these genes are not expressed in day- 2 or older pupae,                    pharate adults or adults. This apparent irreversible inactivation               of Lhp genes after metamorphosis and the concomitant activation                 of vitellogenin genes can be explained, in theory, on the basis                 of changes in the population of trans acting transcriptional                    factors in fat body cell nuclei. Dr. Kumaran has the entire                     transcription unit and 4 to 5 kb of the upstream sequences and 2                to 3 kb of downstream sequences of Lhp76. He proposes to                        characterize this and the Lhp82 gene in detail and identify the                 cis acting regulatory elements by in vitro transcription assays                 and by transient expression assay in primary cultures of Galleria               fat body cells or by studying their expression in tissue culture                cells of Lymantria fat body following stable integration. In                    addition, if found suitable, transgenic flies bearing Lhp gene                  constructs will be used to identify the regulatory elements. The                identity of the regulatory elements will be further defined by                  DNA footprinting and studies on metamorphosis associated changes                in the trans acting factors, using filter binding and gel                       retardation assays will be initiated.                                           %%%                                                                             This proposal will look and how gene expression changes are                     regulated during metamorphosis in insects. This is a dramatic                   developmental change and therefore offers a good model system for               studying the hormone induced alterations in gene expression.",
