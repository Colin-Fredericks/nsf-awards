These Congresses,                       convened every five years since 1956, provide an excellent                      forum for the presentation of fundamental research results in                   human genetics to the international community of scholars in                    this rapidly advancing field.  The primary purpose of the                       Congress is to enhance the body of knowledge in human genetics                  through the exchange of information that will take place.  This                 Congress comes at a most propitious time when important                         advances in basic molecular genetics are being incorporated                     into the practice of human genetics.  The obvious potential                     generated by such powerful analytical techniques as those                       employing recombinant DNA, DNA- and chromosome-mediated gene                    transfer, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, and                        homologous recombination indicate this to be a particularly                     opportune time for such as international meeting.  It should                    be noted that the extensive international collaboration in                      human genetics which presently exists will continue to develop                  as dictated by complementary expertise in different areas for                   the most economical and efficient use of limited scientific                     resources.",
