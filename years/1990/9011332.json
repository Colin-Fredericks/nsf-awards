Deep arrays for measurement of earthquake                                       response are essential to improve the current                                   capability to predict the motion                                                amplification in deep clays, and to predict                                     the liquefaction of sands.  The establishment                                   of such arrays is consistent with the                                           recommendation of the recent NSF-sponsored                                      workshop on designated test sites for                                           geotechnical experimentation in the United                                      States.                                                                         The objectives of this pilot study are to                                       gather information necessary for the                                            selection of sites where arrays of                                              instrumentation for earthquake response could                                   be permanently installed.  An integral part                                     of this study is to review all information                                      available from the Loma Prieta earthquake and                                   other previous events in the San Francisco                                      Bay area to assist in selecting the most                                        suitable candidate sites in the San Francisco                                   Bay area for implementation of the arrays.                                      Of special interest are all field                                               geotechnical data acquired after the Loma                                       Prieta earthquake which will further help the                                   selection process.  Necessary steps include                                     visiting and surveying the potential sites                                      and initiating the steps that are necessary                                     to ensure long-term availability of these                                       sites.                                                                                                                                                          The final goal is to recommend sites and                                        areas within the selected sites for the                                         establishment of seismic recording stations                                     in the San Francisco Bay area.",
