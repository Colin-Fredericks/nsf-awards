The investigators intend to study the structural and tectonic                   evolution of the schist belt that forms the Northern Range of                   Trinidad.  Their work will focus on (1) the sequence of                         structures in the schist belt, (2) their kinematics,                            mechanisms, and conditions of formation, (3) the kinematics                     of emplacement of the schist belt at its present position,                      (4) the structure of its southern margin, and (5) the ages of                   protolith deposition, metamorphism, unroofing, and final                        emplacement.                                                                                                                                                    The problems Drs. Speed and Rowley will be working on                           constitute some of the most significant unknowns in the                         Cenozoic evolution of the Caribbean-South American plate                        boundary.  An improved understanding of the Northern Range                      should throw new light on (1) the most applicable of current                    models of late Cenozoic southeastern Caribbean plate boundary                   kinematics; (2) the evolution of regional structures, basins,                   and hydrocarbons of onland and offshore Trinidad; and (3)                       faulting in the Trinidad region, including the question                         whether Venezuela's El Pilar fault extends to Trinidad or not                   and the origin of Trinidadian seismicity and its hazard                         potential.",
