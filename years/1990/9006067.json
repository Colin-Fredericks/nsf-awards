 "awd_abstract_narration": "The maintenance of male plants and plants possessing both                  male and female reproductive organs in a single species has been                termed androdioecy.  However, several plant scientists have                     suggested that it is theoretically very difficult for this                      reproductive system to exist in nature.  In fact, not one                       androdioecious species had been documented prior to current work.               Dr. Rieseberg and his colleagues have recently demonstrated that                the plant species Datisca glomerata is androdioecious and propose               the determine how this reproductive system originated and how it                is being maintained.                                                                 Because Datisca glomerata is the only plant species known to               be androdioecious, it will provide a model system for studies in                the field of plant biology.  Basic scientific questions can be                  addressed using this model system:  1)  how do different                        reproductive systems in plants evolve and how are they                          maintained?  2)  how can one reproductive system be changed to                  another?  and 3)  what is the genetic or environmental basis for                this  change?                                                                        These questions are important for basic plant ecologists,                  but are also relevant to breeders trying to improve existing crop               plants or trying to develop new agriculturally  important plants.               For example, a species that has both male and female plants is                  quite inefficient as a crop plant because only 50% of the plants                will bear fruit.  Understanding reproductive system evolution is                also important for the maintenance of biodiversity.  Changes in                 reproductive system can alter species stability and potentially                 lead to their extinction.",
