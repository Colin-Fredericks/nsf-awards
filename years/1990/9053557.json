 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of the Association of Science-Technology Centers                   (ASTC) is a three-year program to enhance the knowledge and                     skills of teacher educators in science and technology centers                   and museums nationally.  In turn, these teacher educators                       will use what they learn to improve their own teaching of                       children, and the inservice and professional development                        programs which they now offer to elementary school teachers.                    The program will work extensively with 90 teacher educators                     in teams of two or three over a three year period.  Summer                      institutes will be taught by some of the country's most                         outstanding teacher educators and research scholars in the                      fields of learning, teacher education, and multicultural                        education.  Through the networking capabilities of ASTC and                     regular yearly meetings, these science educators will support                   each other as they plan and engage in local projects designed                   to improve the teaching of science at the elementary level.                     As a result of this program, as many as 9,000 classroom                         teachers may have access to high quality professional                           development opportunities, which better equip them to                           implement inquiry-based science instruction.  The cost                          sharing for the project will be fifty five percent of the NSF                   portion.",
