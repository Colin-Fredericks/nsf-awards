 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central focus of this research is to obtain a better                        understanding of the formation of micro- or macro-structures for                several classes of polymers and their transformation by                         application of mechanical stress, electric field or heat.  The                  ultimate goal is to obtain a general model incorporating                        cooperativity and capable of defining the molecular mechanism                   responsible for macroscopic mechanical-electrical (piezoelectric)               or mechanical-optical behavior of polymers.  The research is to                 be carried out in several stages:  1.  Technique development to                 measure structural changes with high precision and temporal                     resolution;  2.  Clear definition of sample morphology;  3.                     Measurement of the response of chain conformation or segmental                  orientation of each structural subunit when stressed;  4.                       Comparison of experimental data to presently available theories                 to develop more complete models.  The characterization of                       syndiotactic poly(styrene), which exhibits several solid-solid                  phase transformations, will be carried out.  Identification of                  parameters governing mechanically induced polarization, or its                  converse, electrical field induced stress, for piezoelectric                    polymers will also be a primary area of investigation.  These                   experimental data will be initially analyzed using a cooperative                transition model.",
