The extension of the database will include the following new               information:                                                                         (1)  After-college data on a particular early cohort;                           (2)  After-high-school data on a younger cohort;                                (3)  Follow-up of nonrespondents to earlier surveys;                            (4)  Data on a new cohort of gifted students from culturally                         diverse backgrounds;                                                       (5)  Data on a new cohort of average ability students                                to serve as controls for various studies;                                  (6)  Retrospective data on a high achieving graduate                                 student cohort.
