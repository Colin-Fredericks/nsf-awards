 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to develop a detailed                         understanding of the mechanisms involved in photoregulated                      developmental gene expression in A. nidulans.  One aim of this                  work is to identify and characterize light-specific genes.  The                 wild-type function of the velvet gene is required for                           photoregulated development, but mutation of this gene does not                  interfere with the formation of differentiated structures.  This                gene has been cloned by mutant complementation and experiments                  are proposed to characterize its expression and to determine its                pattern of transcription in the wild-type and in specific                       developmental mutants.  A functional analysis of the velvet gene                through the use of gene fusions will be initiated.  Additional                  light-specific genes have been identified by mutation and will be               analyzed by light-dark shifting experiments.  Methods are also                  proposed to isolate novel loci involved in the photoresponse.                   Another aim of this project is to identify conidiation-specific                 genes that require light for their expression and to deduce                     possible cis-acting regulatory sequences that control the                       transcription of these genes.  The study of Photoregulated                      conidiation in Aspergillus nidulans will help elucidate the                     complex regulatory mechanisms that affect cellular                              differentiation in eukaryotes, using an organism that is highly                 amenable to detailed genetic and molecular analyses.                                                                                                            Light is critically required for the normal growth and                          development of most plants.  Plants possess mechanisms for                      sensing and responding to light, and some of these responses                    involve the activation of specific genes.  Relatively little is                 known about the mechanisms of these responses, largely because it               is only recently that molecular genetic analysis has been applied               to these responses in plants.  The author of this proposal has,                 during a period of previous NSF support, made the unexpected                    discovery that light is critically required for the completion of               the developmental cycle of the mold Aspergillus nidulans, and                   that the mechanism of the mold's response to light appears                      similar to that of higher plants.  He here proposes a detailed                  molecular genetic analysis of this response.  The ease of genetic               manipulation of the mold promises rapid and important new                       insights into the mechanism of light responses.",
