 "awd_abstract_narration": "The factors that control genetic transmission in populations               determine the course of evolutionary change.  This research                     project is concerned with the transmission of a series of genes                 that control flower color variants in the common morning glory.                 The project is also concerned with the molecular events that                    produce different flower color types.  Previous work has shown                  that several ecological factors interact with morning glory                     reproductive biology to cause the differential transmission of                  white and pigmented color variants.  Counter balancing these                    selective forces are high rates of mutation at the gene loci                    that determine white color.  Dr. Clegg has shown that these high                mutation rates are most probably the result of transposable                     elements that disrupt gene function at the white locus.                              The proposed work seeks to further investigate the molecular               bases of flower color variation.  To accomplish this goal the                   investigators have begun a molecular analysis of variation at the               locus that encodes CHS, a key enzyme in pigment biosynthesis.                   Earlier work indicates that the white type is the result of a                   mutation at the CHS locus.  Several copies of the CHS gene have                 been cloned using the methods of recombinant DNA technology.  Dr.               Clegg now seeks to build on this foundation through genetic and                 molecular analyses.                                                                  The proposed research should fill in a void in basic                       knowledge of the dynamics of gene transfer.  From an applied                    agricultural perspective, it is important to have a detailed                    understanding of the nature of mutational diversity in plant                    species.  The proposed work will contribute to this understanding               by characterizing the nature of molecular diversity in plant                    genes.***",
