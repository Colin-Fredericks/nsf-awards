 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existence of a flow separation and a recirculating region                   has a significant effect on heat transfer characteristics and                   heat transfer performance in engineering devices, such as                       compact heat exchangers, electronic equipment, digital                          computers, and gas turbines.  In some cases these separated                     flow regions are added to the design of heat transfer devices                   to enhance the heat transfer, but their effectiveness has not                   been justified or verified experimentally for buoyancy-                         affected laminar flows.  In situations in which the                             temperature difference is large, and the flow velocity is                       small, buoyancy force effects become significant.  The role                     the buoyancy force plays in such a complex flow configuration                   involving flow separation and reattachment has been studied                     only numerically in a limited scope by the authors recently,                    and has not been explored experimentally at all.  The proposed                  research, consisting of coordinated experimental and numerical                  studies involving separated flows in stepped channels and                       along stepped flat plates oriented in vertical, inclined, and                   horizontan positions, is aimed at providing quantitative                        (measured and predicted) results for the flow and heat                          transfer in the separated and reattached flow regions for                       these flow configurations.  Emphasis will be placed on the                      experimental study and the flow and heat transfer results will                  be obtained for both buoyancy assisting and opposing                            conditions under heating by uniform wall temperature or by                      uniform surface heat flux.  It is expected that, under the                      buoyancy assisting flow conditions, the reattachment length                     will decrease with an increase in buoyancy forces and that                      when the geometry is inclined or horizontal, a three-                           dimensional unsteady vortex flow could occur.  Experimental                     observations will define the region and conditions where these                  characteristics develop in this flow geometry.  Both backward-                  facing and forward-facing steps with different step heights                     will be treated in the proposed research.  Results from the                     proposed research will be correlated to provide the building                    blocks that are needed in dealing with heat transfer in                         complex, buoyancy-affected separated flows that are prevalent                   in many engineering devices.",
