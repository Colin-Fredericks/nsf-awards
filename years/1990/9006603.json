 "awd_abstract_narration": "A principal aim of the proposal work is to understand the                  evolution of interactions between a herbivorous insect and                      several of its host plants.  Although it is generally accepted                  that insects evolve in response to selection pressures mediated                 by plants, the role of insects attack as a cause of plant                       evolution is controversial.  The P.I.'s propose to initiate a                   preliminary investigation of this role, using the butterfly                     Euphydryas editha, in which geographical variation of diet is                   already well documented.                                                             Studies of interpopulation variation of plant acceptability                will quantify the contribution of plant variation to the observed               geographical variation of insect diet.  Correlations between                    attack rates and acceptability may suggest hypotheses about the                 nature and extent of plant evolutionary responses to insect                     attack.                                                                              Within a plant population that shows variation of                          acceptability the investigators will estimate the correlation                   between acceptability and fitness in the presence and absence of                insects.  If there studies are successful, an experiment that                   simulates the evolutionary effects of insect attack by applying                 artificial selection to plant acceptability will be attempted.",
