 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on the development of improved               techniques for solving the acoustic and elastic wave equations.                 The work has applications to seismic exploration, nondestructive                testing, sonar interpretation, and other fields.  The immediate                 aim is to enhance numerical methods for the so-called forward                   problem, in which initial-boundary data and material properties                 are assumed known.  However, the research has the ultimate                      objective of using accurate forward solvers in an iterative                     fashion to attack the inverse problem, in which one seeks                       estimates of material properties (wave velocities) given observed               responses of the medium to seismic waves.                                            The project represents a continuation of earlier research at               Wyoming, in which codes were developed for solving the acoustic                 and elastic wave equations in three space dimensions.                                The project addresses several numerical approaches.  Among                 these are the representation of interfaces between strata having                different wave velocities, the construction of spatial grids that               will yield accurate discretizations in highly heterogeneous                     media, the design of efficient time-stepping schemes and                        associated numerical linear algebra, and the adaptation of                      numerical procedures to parallel- and vector architecture                       machines.  Another important element of the project is the                      continued development of object-oriented graphics software to aid               in the visualization of large-scale model results.",
