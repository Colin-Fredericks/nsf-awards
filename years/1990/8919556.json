 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the  \"Workshop on the Future of                        Database Systems Research\" is to enumerate the most promising                   directions for database research in the broadest sense and to                   explore what can be expected to be achieved in the next decade.                 A secondary purpose is to examine existing technologies in                      related fields and foster interaction with researchers in those                 fields. The emphasis will be placed on collaborative research                   leading towards building of the next generation of intelligent                  information systems, comprised of multi-media databases                         distributed over a large geographical area. To that end, a                      panel including representatives of all aspects of database                      systems, with special care to include researchers from related                  fields will be chosen.                                                                                                                                          The workshop participants will prepare a position paper that                    will be submitted to NSF and also will be made available to a                   wide community involved in database research and development,                   management or planning. The objective of this report is to make                 valid predictions and to explain the field and its challenges.",
