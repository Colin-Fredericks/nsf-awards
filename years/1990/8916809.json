 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circulating androgen derived from gonadal secretions is converted to            estradiol (neuroestrogen) within the brain and pituitary.  This                 transformation, which is catalyzed by an enzyme complex termed                  aromatase (P450arom), is essential for the full expression of androgen          actions on brain sex differentiation, sex behavior and reproductive             neuroendocrinology.   Because the brain and pituitary are structurally          and functionally complex and the quantity of neuroestrogen is very              small, it has been difficult to determine how P450arom is regulated,            its precise cellular and subcellular location, and the cellular targets         and mechanisms by which neuroestrogen exerts its actions.  Dr. Callard          has identified an animal model, the goldfish, in which P450arom                 activity is 100-to-100- times higher than in conventional laboratory            species.  Moreover, brain androgen receptors are correspondingly                elevated.  Based on this correlation and results of experiments during          the last project period, she postulates a functional interrrelationship         between P450arom and androgen receptors in which locally synthesized            estrogen acts as a positive feedback regulator of quantifiable                  endpoints for elucidating the parahormonal role of neuroestrogen in             brain and pituitary.  To this end, she proposes to isolate and                  characterize cDNA probes for the goldfish P450arom and androgen                 receptor genes, to develop antibodies for measuring their protein               products, and to apply these new tools to unanswered questions using            the goldfish model.",
