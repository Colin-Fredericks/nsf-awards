 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate relationships between                        hormones, mood, and competitive interactions among men.  A                      commonly held notion among scientists and lay people is that                    hormones must play some role in human male aggression, dominance,               and competition.  Previous research involving extrapolations from               animal studies, and specific investigations in men has supported                this idea.  And, a relationship between hormones and aggressive                 behavior and mood states in men, while controversial, is advanced               by recent data linking aggressive reaction patterns and                         personality characteristics to testosterone levels.  Dr. Brian                  Gladue has shown that status and mood changes in men cause short-               term changes in testosterone levels.  Using saliva assays during                competitive states, this investigator is able to determine                      testosterone levels using a non-invasive technique.  His work                   will expand the investigation of mood, affect, hormones and                     dominance/competition to better understand temporal aspects of                  hormone-mood relationships involving cortisol and testosterone                  throughout and after competitive interactions.",
