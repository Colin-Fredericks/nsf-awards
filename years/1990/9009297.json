 "awd_abstract_narration": "A debate has raged for decades over the extent to which                    labor market outcomes--labor force participation, unemployment, and             personal earnings--are constrained by the particular composition of             industrial structures and labor market institutions in individual               cities and regions.  Most economists agree that short-term unemployment         rates vary from one region to another depending on how the business             cycle affects short-term industry demand and therefore industry                 employment levels.  There is widespread disagreement, however, as to            whether persistent differentials in labor force participation rates,            group unemployment rates, and group wage rates strictly reflect                 differences in human capital or whether they are mediated by the                industrial environment of various regions.  This project will test              hypotheses concerning the origins of the \"underclass\" in urban areas,           and it will assess the extent to which the differential decline in              manufacturing industries across metropolitan areas has contributed to           the growth of the \"underclass.\"  The project also will examine the              extent to which public policy should focus on \"demand side\" (economic           development) versus \"supply side\" (human capital) interventions.  The           investigators will conduct an empirical investigation of changing labor         market opportunities facing out-of-school youth.  Using both                    descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis, they will              integrate Current Population Survey data and SMSA-specific data to              produce a data base for comparing a cohort of young workers in the              mid-1960s with one in the mid-1980s.                                                                                                                                 This project addresses an issue of national importance, and it             will also contribute to the resolution of demand- vs. supply-side               theoretical issues.  It will fill in some important gaps in our                 understanding of what has been happening in the labor market during the         past 25 years.  The analysis will contribute to the solution of                 societal problems related to the unemployment and underemployment of            less-educated urban residents, and it will serve as a guide to                  developing policies to meet human capital and employment needs.",
