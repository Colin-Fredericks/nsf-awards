 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department at The American             University to purchase equipment for a new laboratory course                    entitled \"Techniques of Evolutionary Research\".  Methods for                    studying evolutionary mechanisms and reconstructing evolutionary                history have diversified.  Understanding of the genetic structure               of species has been deepened by the adaption of molecular biology               techniques and quantitative analysis.  Equipment purchased through              this award will be used to train students in these current methods.             Students will learn up-to-date methods for the study of:  (1)                   molecular evolution (2) quantitative genetics and (3) phylogenetic              reconstruction.  Laboratory exercises in molecular evolution will               use a frost-free freezer, a chromatography refrigerator, a mini-                fermentor, 2 pH meters, 2 top-loading balances, and an ice machine.             Quantitative genetic analysis will use an electrobalance and an                 image analysis system.  A PS/2 computer is will be purchased for                operating programs for phylogenetic reconstruction.  All equipment              will be secondarily available to other courses, so approximately                1000 students will profit from this equipment acquisition over a                5-year period.  The aim of \"Techniques of Evolutionary Research\"                is to insight interest in evolution and to develop skills useful                in careers in organismic biology, but useful in all other areas of              biological research as well.",
