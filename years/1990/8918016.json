 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RAS genes were first discovered as the transforming                         principles of oncogenic retroviruses, but have subsequently been                found to be important normal constituents of the mammalian                      genome.  They have been highly conserved in evolution and are                   members of a larger family of genes which encode small molecular                weight guanine nucleotide binding proteins.  Although the                       function of RAS remains unknown, there has been recent, striking                progress in understanding of the RAS proteins, and much more can                be anticipated in the near future, including:  an understanding                 of effector function for RAS in micro-organisms, discovery of a                 large number of additional, RAS-related genes and their modes of                action, the regulation of RAS and RAS-related proteins, their                   processing, their structure, and their physiological role.  It is               becoming clear that a vast array of cellular processes are                      controlled by these proteins, and hence, an understanding of RAS                is not only essential for an understanding cellular growth                      control, but for much of cell biology as well.  About 300                       investigators representing cell biology, molecular biology,                     pharmacology, and structural biochemistry are expected to                       participate.                                                                                                                                                    The proposed meeting on \"The Function and Evolution of RAS                      Proteins\" will bring together investigators in the field of RAS                 research in order to accelerate the exchange of information,                    promote cooperation and catalyse the development of fresh                       approaches to the understanding of this important cell biological               problem.",
