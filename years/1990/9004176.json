 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will determine the relative timing of genetic recombination                  and chromosome pairing in normal strains of the fungus Coprinus                 cinereus.  We will ask if the presence of flanking                              insertion/deletion heterozygosities alters the timing or amount                 of exchange in the test interval.  We will examine recombination                in the test interval using strains that fail to complete                        chromosome pairing due to the presence of the rad3-1 mutation.                  We will also monitor the timing of genetic exchange between                     homologous sequences that are located at non-homologous positions               in the genome.  The specificity of meiotic chromosome pairing is                not known.  It has been suggested that some aspects of the                      recombination mechanism might provide this specificity, but                     evidence to test these models is lacking.  Such models would                    predict that exchange should precede or occur simultaneously with               pairing, but not follow pairing.  Such models also predict the                  occurrence of mutant strains that are recombination-proficient                  but pairing deficient.  These two predictions will be tested in                 the experiments proposed here.  The results will provide an                     important framework for understanding the molecular basis of                    homologue recognition in meiotic prophase.                                                                                                                      All living organisms have mechanisms to ensure that their genetic               information, packaged in their chromosomes is passed from one                   generations to the next in a faithful and orderly way.  This is a               proposal to resolve some important long-standing questions about                the nature of these mechanisms.",
