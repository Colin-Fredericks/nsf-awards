 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California, San Diego, proposes an RCMS program to          increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who earn           the Ph.D. in oceanography and its related constituent fields.  The              program will have secondary, undergraduate, and graduate components.            At the secondary level, efforts will be made to improve science                 instruction and to provide academic enrichment and career counseling            for students in selected schools.  At the undergraduate level, the              program will consist of four elements:  a faculty preceptor program,            small seminars for freshmen and sophomores interested in science; a             faculty mentor program, two-term research experiences for juniors and           seniors majoring in science; a summer research program, eight-week              summer experiences at Scripps Institution of Oceanography for science           majors between their junior and senior years; and an undergraduate              research conference, opportunities for students to make public                  presentations of research papers.  At the graduate level, students              will be enrolled in the Scripps graduate program.  The RCMS program             will be carried out jointly by UCSD's Scripps Institution of                    Oceanography, the Office of Graduate Studies and Research, and the              Office of Undergraduate Affairs.",
