 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nuclear Physics Laboratory (NPL) of the University of                  Illinois conducts fundamental research in nuclear science using                 an in-house superconducting electron accelerator (MUSL-II) and                  a number of higher energy user facilities located in the US,                    Canada, and Europe.  The central thrust of NPL research is                      electromagnetic nuclear physics (EMNP); i.e., electron                          scattering and photoreactions.  Smaller programs of anti-proton                 annihilation studies using CERN facilities and of accelerator                   physics are also being conducted.                                                    MUSL-II provides continuous wave electron beams at                         energies up to 100 MeV for use in electro-and photo-induced                     coincidence reaction studies, primarily related to nuclear                      structure.  Following conclusion of MUSL-II research                            activities, a program of full user mode EMNP research will be                   conducted, principally at the MIT/Bates, University of                          Saskatchewan, and CEBAF electron accelerators, aimed generally                  at sub-nuclear degrees of freedom (nucleons, mesons, and                        quarks).                                                                             Instrumentation development is an important function at                    the NPL.  Large scale equipment construction projects will be                   undertaken in support of the user program and including                         detectors, electronics, spectrometers, specialized targets,                     polarized electron sources, and related equipment.                                   Graduate students are integrated into all aspects of NPL                   research, including equipment development, and their training                   is a prominent aspect of NPL activities.  Approximately 16                      graduate students in residence will be supported by this grant.",
