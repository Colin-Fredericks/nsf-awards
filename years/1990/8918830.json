 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to study experimentally fundamental heat                    transfer issues for subcooled bubbly boiling flow in the                        annulus between two tubes, the inner one heated.  In such                       flows, heat transfer can take place between the walls and the                   vapor, between the walls and the liquid, between liquid and                     vapor, and latent heat is absorbed in the vaporization                          process.  By means of very detailed measurements of time                        resolved velocity, temperature, and by flow visualization, the                  author hopes to gain the basic knowledge to formulate a more                    comprehensive theoretical model than presently exists.  In                      particular, the PI hopes to investigate the role of turbulence                  in this process.  He proposes to do this for two fluids, R113                   and water to determine the extent of universality of his                        conclusions.  The final objective of the work is to develop a                   mechanistic model of subcooled boiling flow on the basis of                     these measurements.",
