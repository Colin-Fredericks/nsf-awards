 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support from the National Science                           Foundation to develop a strategic plan for implementing a                       successful Metropolitan Washington Alliance for Increasing                      Minority Graduates in Science and Engineering.  The                             specific goal of the Alliance is to increase the annual                         number of African-American and Hispanic S&E baccalaureate                       graduates in the area to 2,000 by the year 2000.  It is                         estimated that in 1989, some 400 African-American and                           Hispanic students earned baccalaureate degrees in science                       and engineering in the metropolitan Washington area.  We                        have established a goal that will increase that number by                       a magnitude of five in the year 2000.  This can only be                         accomplished by developing a systematic approach to S&E                         education focusing on precollege and undergraduate                              enrichment, academic and support services.  The                                 jurisdictions served by this proposal include the                               Washington Metropolitan area represented by counties and                        cities in suburban Maryland, Northern Virginia and the                          District of Columbia, a 2,300 square mile are with                              approximately 2.7 million people.                                                                                                                               The Washington, D.C. metropolitan region is especially                          will-suited for the establishment of a successful                               Alliance.  It is one of the leading scientific research                         and development centers in the nation; the center of the                        Federal scientific effort; the site of many Government                          laboratories; a focal point for industrial research and                         development (with business showing great interest in S&E                        activities in the region); a major center of African-                           American and Asian-American life); the location of a                            number of comprehensive universities; and an area with                          more than 50,000 African-American and Hispanic youth                            between the ages of 16 and 18, who, with adequate support,                      have the potential to become 2,000 S&E baccalaureate                            graduates.                                                                                                                                                      Howard University is especially well-suited to assume the                       leadership role in this Alliance because the University is                      a comprehensive university of national significance, with                       graduate programs in a number of fields of natural science                      and mathematics, as well as in engineering, medicine, and                       dentistry.                                                                                                                                                      With its national Advisory Committee, chaired by                                Congressman Mervyn Dymally, the University's Institute for                      Science, Space and Technology has already begun to lay the                      groundwork for the development of an Alliance in the                            metropolitan Washington region.  On June 27, 1990, a                            meeting was held with Howard University officials and                           representatives of the Consortium of Colleges and                               Universities, D.C. Public Schools, Montgomery County                            Public Schools, Federal R&D agencies, businesses and other                      private organizations to review opportunities and expand                        the development of this proposal.",
