 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of ten U.S. scientists                in a U.S.-Japan joint seminar concerning the El Nino-Southern                   Oscillation (ENSO) Phenomenon, a combined atmospheric and                       oceanic phenomenon which occurs in the tropical Pacific                         region.  ENSO has major societal impacts through its effects                    upon fisheries in the region, upon monsoon rainfall over many                   countries, and through its influence upon the year-to-year                      variability of temperature and precipitation over temperate                     latitudes of the Pacific basin, including areas of the U.S.                     and Japan.  The phenomena associated with ENSO are also of                      great interest from the standpoint of long-range prediction of                  mid-latitude climate.  Progress in observing, understanding,                    and predicting these phenomena has been particularly rapid in                   recent years in the United States and Japan, and it is thus                     an appropriate time for scientists from those countries to                      hold a seminar to discuss recent progress and future directions                 in observation, theory, and modeling.  The meeting will be                      held in Seattle, Washington, September 10-14, 1990, under the                   auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science Program.  The                    co-organizers of the seminar are Professors Edward Sarachik                     and John M. Wallace of the Joint Institute for the Study of                     the Atmosphere and Ocean, University of Washington; and                         Professor Taroh Matsuno of the Geophysical Institute, University                of Tokyo, Japan.                                                                                                                                                An earlier workshop on ENSO, convened in Tokyo in 1987, led to                  considerable sharing of research results between U.S. and                       Japanese scientists working in this field, as well as to later                  collaborative projects and research visits.  This present                       seminar is expected to be even more effective in providing an                   opportunity for information exchange and in stimulating                         interactions between two research communities actively                          studying the ENSO Phenomenon.",
