Dr. Bien's research aim is to bring to bear on                      several problems in mathematics and science his expertise in the                representation theory of groups. Within mathematics, he will work               on deciding precisely which nonlinear differential equations can                be integrated by the inverse spectral transform. In theoretical                 computer science, Dr. Bien will work on expanding graphs, which                 may model ideal communication networks. He will also apply his                  knowledge to the field of neural networks.                                           Group theory began in the early nineteenth century as a                    description of operations that might be done successively, and                  also undone, as a ninety-degree clockwise rotation is undone by                 the ninety-degree counterclockwise rotation. Lie groups were                    developed in the late part of that century by the path breaking                 Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie, who was interested in the                   most fundamental questions concerning differential equations.                   Now, one hundred years later, group theory pervades modern                      science, and the utility of Lie groups in many branches of                      mathematics, as well as in physics, has continued undiminished.",
