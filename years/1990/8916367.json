 "awd_abstract_narration": "The volcanic rocks associated with the Keweenawan Midcontinent                  Rift of the Lake Superior region afford an excellent opportunity                to study the mantle sources of picritic and basaltic primitive                  magmas.  From previous work the PIs have acquired major and trace               element data on >350 consecutive lava flows comprising a 5,350                  meter continuous section of the Mamainse Point volcanics of                     Ontario.  This section records almost the entire history of the                 aborted rifting episode from initial subsidence through nearly to               the cessation of volcanism.  The data reveal numerous                           stratigraphically-constrained, chemically distinct groups of                    lavas.  There are also limited data on an additional 1200 meter                 volcanic section at Alona Bay.  Trace element characteristics of                the Mamainse Point groups indicate the presence of heterogeneity                and variable enrichment in the mantle source of the basalts.                    Crustal contamination is indicated locally, but does not appear                 to be pervasive.  Because of the amount of data, superb                         stratigraphic control, continuous section, and near completeness                of record, these lavas should provide invaluable evidence about                 the nature, heterogeneity, and structure of the Middle                          Proterozoic mantle.  In order to be conclusive, however, present                data need to be augmented by radiogenic isotope studies and                     crucial trace elements.  Selected critical samples                              representative of the groups will be analyzed for Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr,                 and U-Th-Pb isotopic systematics and important trace elements                   (e.g., Th, Ta, Hf).  Specifically, the the isotopic systematics                 and trace elements will be used to test ideas about: 1) the                     presence and character of old, enriched lithosphere beneath the                 Archean craton, 2) the nature of the underlying asthenophere (N-                MORB-like or enriched?), 3) the presence of OIB-like melts near                 the top of the section, 4) the extent and character of crustal                  contamination, 5) the formation and evolution of the                            Midcontinent Rift.",
