 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns fundamental mathematical questions in                harmonic analysis. Among the principal research directions will                 be the study of multidimensional convolutions with measures                     supported on curves. The object is to expand on E. Stein's                      observation that the convolution of singular measures with                      functions in Lebesgue spaces may result in functions in related                 Lebesgue spaces. This research will focus on those measures                     concentrated on smooth curves. The entire question of convolution               along cuves has its roots in the theory of differentiation of                   integrals, which in turn is a formulation of integral solutions                 of partial differential equations.                                                   A second line of investigation will focus on obtaining sharp               Sobolev inequalities for non-elliptic, constant coefficient                     differential operators which reflect the symmetry of certain                    orthogonal groups.  Sobolev-type inequalities are crucial in                    obtaining existence results for partial differential operators.                 They form a class of inequalities in which the norm of a function               is dominated by the norm (possibly a different norm) of its                     gradient.  Two particular cases will be addressed in this work,                 the classical wave operator and the Klein-Gordon operator.",
