 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is part of a long-term editing project, the first                 comprehensive edition, in three volumes, of James Clerk Maxwell's               scientific letters and manuscript papers, to be published by                    Cambridge University Press.  Maxwell was the most important                     physicist of the nineteenth century, and his work was seminal in                establishing the electromagnetic theory of light and statistical                physics, work that is fundamental to modern science and technology.             Under this grant, Dr. Harman is working on the editorial commentary             for Volume II of the edition, which covers the years 1862-73.  The              manuscript papers of this period, which are of especial interest                and complexity, shed important light on Maxwell's scientific                    maturity, the period in which he wrote the classic works on field               physics and statistical molecular theory on which his unique                    reputation largely rests.  The edition aims at textual accuracy and             completeness. The textual notes and introductions clarify textual               obscurities and establish the historical context within which the               documents were written, employing contemporary published and                    manuscript sources.  The work, to be carried out at Harvard                     University in consultation with historians of physics in the Boston             area, will make available, in a critical edition, fundamental                   source materials for the study of modern science.",
