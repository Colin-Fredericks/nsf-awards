 "awd_abstract_narration": "By 1995, Blacks and Hispanics are expected to make up about 28%                 of college-age students in the U.S.  Considering the role science               and technology play in the world, the percentage of doctoral                    degrees awarded to minorities in the United States is alarmingly                low.                                                                            In order to have more minority students participating in these                  fields, as well as provide a vital background for those NOT                     choosing science careers, it is necessary to interest them in                   science and math at an early age.  This means that young children               who have a natural curiosity about everything around them must                  keep that curiosity and learn to see the connection of science                  and math with things that interest them.                                        The 1/2 hour film will address 7 to 12 year-olds and show that                  science and technology are present in some form in everything                   around them, and they have a connection with things children know               and like:  sports, TV, water, space, etc.",
