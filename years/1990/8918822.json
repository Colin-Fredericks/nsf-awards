 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms that survive extreme dehydration (including, for                 example, yeast cells, seeds, fungal spores, and certain microscopic             animals) contain large quantities of sugars, particularly the                   disaccharides sucrose or trehalose.  Previous studies have shown that           subcellular fractions such as labile enzymes and membranes can be               preserved intact if they are dried in the presence of these sugars.  If         they are dried without the sugars these molecular assemblages are               completely and irreversibly degraded.  This phenomenon has been used to         develop means for preserving proteins, membranes, and liposomes in the          absence of water, leading to several patents that are in use in                 industry.                                                                                                                                                       The current project extends the information about subcellular fractions         to intact cells. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used to             study the state of membranes in intact yeast cells that have been dried         in ways that result in accumulation of various amounts of trehalose.            These studies are designed to test the hypothesis that trehalose                stabilizes membranes in intact cells in much the same ways as it does           in isolated membranes.  A trehalose-dependent phase diagram will be             produced for the cells that should not only test this hypothesis in             detail, but will also be of immediate practical use in the yeast                industry in effecting increased survival of dehydration.  A means will          be sought to introduce trehalose into cells in the dry state that would         not normally survive dehydration.  The route chosen is to use a                 transporter for trehalose that is found in yeasts.  Molecular biology           techniques will be used to clone the gene for this transporter.                 Mutants have already been developed by collaborators in this research           that lack this gene.  The aim is to obtain the gene by complementation          of these mutants.  If successful, the gene will be introduced into              other cells in subsequent research.",
