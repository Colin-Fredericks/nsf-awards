 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project implements mechanisms for cooperation and                          communication within and between complex database transactions                  with the aim of increasing the degree of parallelism as well as                 the level of recovery control during failures. A transaction is                 defined as a partially ordered set of primitive database                        operations. The approach exploits the spatial properties of a                   multidimensional data structure, the Interpolation-Based Grid                   File (IBGF), which represents objects --points, boxes, or                       otherwise. It provides a capability to learn important access                   path information from live processes, prior to accessing the                    data, and a technique to allow sharing of this information among                processes. Throughput will be greatly improved by using this                    capability to anticipate potential conflicts and to reduce access               redundancy. This research will develop servers, responsible for                 any transaction on the IBGF structure, which incorporate this                   access path information passing capability. A transaction manager               will be built on top of IBGF servers. Methods developed by other                researchers will be modified to take advantage of IBGF spatial                  properties to improve performance. The portability of the results               to a commercially available system such as INGRES will be                       considered. The results provide tools for the design of advanced                transaction systems.",
