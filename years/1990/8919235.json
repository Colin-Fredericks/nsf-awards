 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is a combined experimental and theoretical                       examination of phase transformations in materials.  Fast                        (millisecond ) synchrotron-based time resolved X-ray scattering                 is employed to study spinodal decomposition and ordering in                     alloys.  Preliminary research  has concentrated on the classic                  cases of spinodal decomposition in aluminum-zinc and ordering in                copper-gold and showed that there is no significant timescale                   during which the Cahn-Hilliard-Cook linear theory or its                        extension, the Langer-Bar-On-Millier nonlinear theory are valid.                Now the research is centered on alloys with smaller strain                      effects (iron-chromium and iron-cobalt), alloys with second-order               ordering transitions (iron-cobalt and aluminum-iron), and alloys                that undergo simultaneous ordering and phase separation                         (aluminum-iron).  In some of these cases these fast experiments                 probe transformation kinetics in regions of the phase diagram in                which neither phase is the true equilibrium structure.                                                                                                              The simulations and theory part of the research pursues large               scale studies of spinodal decomposition and continuous ordering                 in both Ising models and fluids, for short and long range                       interactions.  Included are studies of crystallization in simple                fluids.  Limits of the present nucleation theories are studied by               taking simulation data as the limit of miscibility is approached                and seeing where the theory begins to fail.  Geometric models are               developed for nucleation and spinodal decomposition",
