 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turtles (chelonians) exhibit the remarkable ability to survive long             periods without breathing.  For example during diving in aquatic                turtles, breatholds for 1 to 2 hours have been observed.  The organ             that plays a critical role in the turtles remarkable breatholding               ability during diving is the heart.  The heart of the turtle is                 comprised of only 3 chambers (as compared to the 4 chambers of mammals          and humans).  The unique anatomy results in the potential for the blood         returning from the body to either circulate through the lungs or to             bypass the lungs.  When the blood bypasses the lungs it is referred to          as a right-to-left intracardiac shunt.  Previous scientific                     investigations have reported that the amount of blood bypassing the             lung is often coupled with ventilatory patterns, with the right-to-left         shunt increasing during breatholding.  In contrast, during breathing            the amount of blood circulating to the lungs increases and the right-           to-left shunt is reduced.  While a large right-to-left shunt would              produce harmful results in mammals and humans, the ability of reptiles          to bypass the lungs may play several important roles during                     breatholding.  These include reducing the energy expenditure of the             heart, the \"metering\" of oxygen from the lung (analogous to a scuba             tank) and maintaining the balance of fluids between the lung and blood.         However, the precise process by which the heart of turtles can                  accomplish varying levels of blood shunting have been controversial and         not well understood.  The study proposed by Dr. Hicks will utilize a            combination of sophisticated radiological techniques, blood flow                measurements and injections of tracer gases to image the heart and              determine blood flow patterns through the heart during a variety of             physiological conditions.  These techniques and the experiments                 outlined in Dr. Hicks' proposal will determine if the process of blood          shunting results either from factors external to the heart (i.e.                regulation by the lung) or factors intrinsic to the heart to                    understanding the evolutionary development of the cardiovascular                system in vertebrate animals.  His elucidation of the mechanism of              blood shunting in reptiles will help to answer the question of what             functional role blood shunting plays in this ancient but important              group of animals.",
