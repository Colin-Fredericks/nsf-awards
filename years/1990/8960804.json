 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent trends in manufacturing have broadly been identified                to be toward greater automation and flexibility.  Accompanying                  these changes has been a need for improved decision-making tools,               especially regarding short-term production changes such as                      responses to unpredicted events and changes in production                       requirements.  The transfer of proven design tools such as                      computer simulation, however, has not yet taken place, limiting                 the potential productivity improvements of automation.                               This project will investigate modifications of existing                    simulation technology to permit real-time decision-making in                    control of manufacturing facilities.  These new simulation                      capabilities will permit production schedulers, factory managers,               and others who must make rapid decision regarding production                    changes to automatically evaluate the performance of many                       alternatives, resulting in better decisions and greater                         productivity.                                                                        It is expected that this technology will be applicable in                  any manufacturing facility for use in evaluation of short-term                  scheduling options, maintenance policies, staffing scenarios,                   etc.  Products developed using this technology would have a                     significant market across a broad spectrum of manufacturing                     processes, from microelectronics to automobiles.",
