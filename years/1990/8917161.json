 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to further develop and document the phenomenon               of shear-wave splitting due to anisotropy, a topic that has                     important implications for plate tectonics and models of the                    earth.  The work will map the alignment of olivine in the mantle                beneath the Basin and Range and eastward to the San Andreas                     Fault.  This will allow the researchers to examine the transition               between the transform regime in California and the extension                    beneath the Basin and Range, and the relation between the styles                of past and present extension in the Basin and Range.  The                      technique involves analyzing shear-wave splitting from recordings               of S, SKS, and ScS phases of earthquakes at teleseismic distances               to measure the velocity anisotropy of the mantle and possibly the               crust.  Shear-wave splitting may be a diagnostic in the process                 of preparation of earthquakes and this research is therefore a                  contribution to the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
