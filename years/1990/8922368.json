 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is a collaborative effort between Cornell                          University, University of California at San Diego, and AT&T Bell                Laboratories.  The research investigates ion- and thermal-                      induced transformations in germanium silicide and aluminide                     materials.  The effort is a renewal award (DMR-8618761) for a                   grant that was highly productive (more than twenty five                         publications in the scientific literature and three Ph.D.                       degrees).  The research has three thrusts: (1) heteroepitaxial                  growth of germanium silicide systems from amorphous alloys                      including ion-induced heteroepitaxy, and solid phase epitaxy with               and without transport medium,  (2) metal/germanium silicide                     reactions,  (3) amorphous and metastable crystalline phase                      formation in aluminum/platinum and aluminum palladium systems.                  Ion beam irradiation and thermal annealing are used to                          investigate systems of multilayered and co-deposited materials.                 T^he primary analytical techniques are  Rutherford backscattering               spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron                          microscopy, and electrical property measurements.  The effort at                Cornell emphasizes electron microscopy and Rutherford                           backscattering; University of California at San Diego, x-ray                    diffraction and electrical characterization; AT&T Bell                          Laboratories, ion beam research.  All three groups have                         capability in the area of specimen preparation.",
