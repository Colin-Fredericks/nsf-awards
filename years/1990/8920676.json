 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current production of aluminum in the United States is                          approximately 3.8 x 106 metric tons per year.  The presently                    used system for the production of aluminum is the Hall-Herault                  cell. It is operated at 950oC  to 980oC  and consists of a                      carbon cavity (lining) which conducts current from a molten                     aluminum cathode on the bottom of the cathode cavity.                           Consumable carbon anodes are suspended in a cryolite                            electrolyte (bath) which floats on the alumina cathode (metal                   pad).  Alumina powder is fed periodically or continuously,                      carbon anodes are consumed continuously (with periodic                          replacement in prebaked anode plants), and molten metal                         product is siphoned approximately daily.  In this work the PI                   will examine new electrode materials and new concepts for                       electrochemical cell design and operation which could save                      energy and lower operating costs on retrofit older plants, as                   well as decrease both capital and operating costs for new                       aluminum reduction plants.                                                                                                                                      The aluminum industry has for decades been pursuing a                           non-consumable anode that can be substituted for the                            consumable carbon anodes in the Hall-Herault cells.  The PI                     plans to test a new alumina/carbon composite anode made of a                    Ni-Fe-Cu cermet material.  This composite anode technology                      utilizes the same reaction as the Hall-Herault technology but                   the alumina in the anode is dissolved at the anode-bath                         interface at exactly the location where oxide ions are                          discharged on the carbon matrix.  The results is that high                      alumina solubility in the bath is not required, and                             low-temperature baths could be used.  The bath to be used in                    this research is a mixture of sodium and lithium cryolites                      having a freezing point less than 670oC and operating at about                  700oC.  Titanium diboride sleeves inside the crucible will                      serve as an alternate cathode to graphite.  Phase I results                     have shown that the electrolyte compositions have the                           appropriate properties for cell operation and process                           feasibility has been proven.  The overall objectives of the                     Phase II research are to develop the basic engineering and                      materials science required for the Phase III and the following                  commercialization of the new technology.  The specific                          objectives are:                                                                 a.
