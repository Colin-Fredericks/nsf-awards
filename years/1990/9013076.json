 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fireflies emit bioluminescent light signals for visual                          communication.  Since the light emitted is dim, the visual system               of fireflies offers a model for investigating how to optimize                   detection of low-intensity optical signals.  Work to date has                   allowed proposing an optimization model for the colors of firefly               bioluminescence, based largely on the sensitivity of the eyes of                different species for light of different colors, or spectral                    sensitivity.  This project will investigate how some                            neurophysiological mechanisms can optimize functioning in                       ecological settings called \"photic niches\" at times related to                  ambient light levels, such as dusk versus late night.  Studies                  will examine if visual sensitivity and flashing rhythm may change               with time of day, if the spectral sensitivity of the                            photoreceptors is different in different parts of the compound                  eye, and what particular role the different photopigments in the                cells of the eye play in modifying the photoreceptor responses.                 This project is a model multidisciplinary approach to                           understanding how a sensory system has become adapted in response               to evolutionary selection pressure on both the signalling system                and the receiver.  Results will bear on ecological and                          evolutionary biology, on insect science and animal behavior, as                 well as neuroscience.  The research environment will provide                    excellent opportunities for training students, particularly                     minorities, in current neuroscience.",
