 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for a conference in the area  of general                  relativity.  The organizers view this as a chance to bring                      researchers in classical relativity, astrophysics  and                          quantum gravity together to discuss common problems. In                         recent years there has been a bridging of the gap between                       these disciplines and cross discussion is clearly warranted.                    For the first time results from mathematical relativity are                     being used in other more familiar branches of physics. These                    include pulsars, nuclear matter, and gravitational radiation.                   In the micro domain, the interface between general relativity                   and high energy physics is an active area of research.                          Cosmology, quantum gravity, \"worm hole\" physics etc. have                       benefitted from ideas originating in mathematical relativity.                   Similarly, relativity has benefitted from activities in QCD.                    These developments clearly show the unity of many areas of                      physics and the need for conferences encouraging cross                          fertilization.  Finally, the organizers wish to use the                         occasion of the conference to honor Professor E. T. Newman of                   the University of Pittsburgh, the current President of the                      60th International Society for General Relativity, on his                       birthday.",
