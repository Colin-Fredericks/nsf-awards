 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the extension of regression methods                 in statistics to deterministic but very complicated responses.                  The motivating application is from semiconductor process and                    device design.  In this application there are computer programs                 that simulate the physics of the fabrication and the operation                  of semiconductor devices.  The result is that electrical                        properties of semiconductors can be computed as a function of the               process specifications in their fabrication.  A combination of                  long running times for the programs and a large number of                       variables that describe the process make it necessary to use                    statistical techniques to find optimal settings of the input                    variables.  One can run the simulators at a set of points and fit               the model to the computed values, for interpolation and                         extrapolation to other possible settings of those values.  By                   choosing the points in a structured manner that incorporates some               randomness, one can estimate the uncertainty in the model.                           This project is in the area of statistics and probability                  and offers a number of statistical applications to the                          semiconductor industry.   The research is to explore an approach                that reflects some standard settings in computer experiments:                   many dimensions, comparatively few data points, and a need to fit               a complex function.",
