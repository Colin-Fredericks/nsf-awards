 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of 3-dimensional topology is often enriched by                   imposing extra structure on 3-manifolds.  A recent construction                 due to Gabai shows that a 3-manifold supports many interesting                  dynamical systems, namely pseudo-Anosov flows.                                       The first two parts of this project aim towards showing that               dynamical systems on a 3-manifold can be used to give complete                  information about an important topological invariant, the                       Thurston norm on homology.  The main work of the first part will                be to show that Gabai's flows are well-behaved enough to                        determine completely the Thurston norm.  The second part will                   focus on explicitly constructing these flows, so as to have an                  efficient algorithm for computing the norm.  A bonus will be a                  method for efficient computation of complete homeomorphism                      invariants of 3-manifolds which fiber over the circle.                               The third and final part of this project addresses a long                  range goal, to investigate the conjecture that every 3-manifold                 which is irreducible and contains a non-separating surface has a                finite cover which fibers over the circle.  Dynamical systems are               potentially useful for this investigation, due to work of Fried.                Mosher will attempt to prove the conjecture for some simple                     examples which are \"as close as possible\" to fibering without                   actually fibering.  If successful, this may yield suggestions for               an attack on the conjecture in general.",
