 "awd_abstract_narration": "Susquehanna University requested ;matching funds to acquire a                   Hewlett Packard Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectral detector (GC/MS)                with an accompanying computer-based data station.  The Chemistry                Department introduces its students to \"hands on\" use of modern                  instruments throughout their four year program.  Mass spectrometry              is the only form of spectroscopy that is taught in depth at                     Susquehanna for which there is no \"hands on\" experience in the                  laboratory.  The Chemistry Department used this instrument to                   introduce the principles and techniques of mass spectrometry and                capillary column gas chromatography into the laboratory curriculum              at a number of levels.  Starting in the freshman year, the                      chemistry and biochemistry majors in doing specials projects                    outside of the classroom and lab, used the instrument to analyze                for triazines in ground and surface waters in the surrounding                   agriculture community.  the GC/MS was used in five courses as well              as in the senior research program and the triazine study.                       The students acquired much broader knowledge of the use of computer             based instrumentation especially in the area of mass spectrometry               and entered industry and graduate school better prepared to use                 modern computer controlled instruments.",
