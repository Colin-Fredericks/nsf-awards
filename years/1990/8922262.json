 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the contemporary public debate over foreign policy reflects a           more academic debate over the sources of stability and security in              international affairs.  Some persons contend that only a balance of             power can ensure stability and state sovereignty, whereas others see            the complex interdependencies of today's world economy and its                  associate international institutions as a substitute for balance of             power.  Unfortunately, although the debate offers deep insights and             raises fundamental questions into the nature of international systems,          it also offers the confusion that accompanies imprecisely formulated            concepts and an imperfect application of subsidiary ideas.                                                                                                      In this research the investigators use a branch of the decision                 sciences called game theory to model anarchic international systems             and to resolve the debate by restating it in a more explicit and                deductive context.  The researchers begin by arguing that the                   traditional notion of collective security corresponds to the system             envisioned by neoliberals, and then use their model of the                      international system to differentiate between balance of power and              collective security in terms of the strategies that characterize the            foreign policies of countries.  The investigators then establish that           both balance of power and collective security can correspond to                 equilibiria in their model.  Initial explorations of this model reveal          that a balance of power does not guarantee every country's security, so         in it countries must be vigilant about their relative share of                  resources.  A collective security equilibrium, on the other hand,               ensures everyone's sovereignty, and thereby allows absolute resource            maximization.  Unlike a balance of power equilibrium, however, a                collective security equilibrium is not strong and is not necessarily            stable or attractive.  Thus, the institutional structures facilitating          the realization of mutual gains from the variety of cooperative                 \"subgames\" characterizing the world economy play a critical role in the         survivability of a collective security arrangement.                                                                                                             An additional feature of this model is that it allows the researchers           to explore the circumstances under which states might voluntarily               relinquish their sovereignty to a more-encompassing authority.  The             classical example of this process is, in fact, the formation of the             American Republic, whereas a more contemporary example is the evolving          integration of Western Europe.  Thus, the model developed by these              researchers allows an uncovering of the fundamental sources of                  stability in international affairs and also allows them to generalize           about the processes by which states are formed.",
