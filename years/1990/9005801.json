 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to help pay international travel and               accommodation costs of North American scientists participating in the           Fourth International Conference on Phloem Transport and Assimilate              Compartmentation.  The conference will be held in Cognac, France from           August 19 through 24, 1990.  Scientists will focus on the specific              processes that are involved in orchestrating the development of the             long-distance transport system of the plant (the phloem in particular)          and form a framework for the integration of events from the cellular,           tissue and whole plant level.  The last conference in this series, held         at Asilomar, California, focussed on the controversies surrounding the          interpretation of experimental data.  Since then, the emergence of              plant molecular biology has provided new avenues by which to study the          phloem and these approaches will be presented for discussion at the             Cognac meeting.  In addition, the program is designed to integrate              structural, physiological and biophysical studies in a manner that              should potentiate conceptual and experimental advances.                                                                                                         The format of the Cognac meeting has been designed to allow those who           attend to be exposed to related areas of translocation.  The meeting            will be a true \"workshop\" in that the program contains a balance of             invited special lectures, formal group discussions on predetermined             topics, group discussions on topics identified by conference                    participants as being in need of research focus (so called trouble              spots), review periods during which the international representatives           from each country will discuss strategies that will foster and                  encourage the coordination of research efforts in this important area           of plant biology.",
