Pitter and Finnegan will investigate the effects of                   included inorganic, ionizable salts on the morphology of ice                    crystals growing in a supercooled liquid water cloud.  The                      hypothesis to be tested is that the freezing potential,                         previously studied for bulk freezing of aqueous solutions, is                   applicable to vapor growth of ice crystals, and that the                        electrostatic forces that result from the freezing potential                    interact with the ice surface tension to determine how the ice                  crystals grow.  The ice crystals are nucleated in a cloud chamber               and grow in free-fall, collecting inorganic salt chemicals by the               same mechanisms that are operable in atmospheric clouds.  The                   work is also of potential importance to crystal growth science in               general.                                                                             Since ice crystal morphological detail is an intrinsic and                 important factor in ice crystal growth rate and hence the time                  for crystal development prior to the onset of aggregation and/or                riming, this research has significance in the understanding of                  the formation of precipitation in clouds with a mixture of ice                  and water.",
