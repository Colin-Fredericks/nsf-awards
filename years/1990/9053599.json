 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research project will study the feasibility of a               major national initiative to change the standard practice of                    staff development in the United States.  Current reform movements               call for teachers to take on new responsibilities for school                    decision making and instructional leadership and then to be held                accountable for student outcomes.  Our teachers must, therefore,                be provided with opportunities to advance their understanding of                subject matter and to build collegial networks in support of                    their efforts.  A shift to this new view of staff development                   will require broadscale changes in policy, practice, and public                 opinion.  As a first step, this study will address a number of                  unanswered questions about the nature and extent of the dominant                paradigm of staff development and about the interest and                        commitment of individuals or organizations whose attention to the               issues of staff development is a necessary ingredient for future                success.  The study should have two important results: 1) It will               provide a much more accurate picture of the dimensions of the                   problems surrounding the funding, organization, and delivery of                 staff development in mathematics and science, and 2) It will lead               to greater understanding of and investment in the issues related                to the reform of staff development in the United States.",
