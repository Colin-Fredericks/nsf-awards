 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is recognized that abiotic \"stress\" or damage and insect and               disease attack on plants can change their subsequent resistance to              insects and diseases.  However, there is little consensus on whether            stress and damage have the same effects; whether abiotic and biotic             perturbations have the same effects; whether insects and diseases               produce the same effects; whether overall resistance increases or               decreases; and what the mechanisms and evolutionary implications are.           In this research, an integrated approach will be taken using                    experiments with a model system--cottonwood, a beetle, an aphid, and            rust and leaf-spot fungi--in order to determine if stress/damage                caused by different insects or diseases results in consistent patterns          of plant physical and chemical characteristics and insect and disease           performance.  By comparing these results with data on chemical and              resistance changes due to abiotic ozone induced stress, the overall             patterns of physical, chemical and biotic changes can be elucidated,            which mechanisms may be responsible can be infered, and the                     implications to the evolution of plant defense can be deduced.  An              understanding of how a plant responds to damage and stress due to               ozone as well as insect herbivory and pathogen-caused disease allows            us to predict the consequences of pollution on plant growth and                 mortality.  These findings have direct implications to issues in                agriculture and forestry on the consequences of air pollution, ozone,           and acid rain on crop yield and forest vigor.                                     Dr. Krischik will teach a topic seminar in plant-insect-microbial             interactions and be a panel member in a full-day forum on                       \"Opportunities in Ecology.\"  Through the IES Education Program, she             will visit area schools and encourage young women to pursue careers in          science and teach in a \"Workshop for School Science Teachers.\"                  Dr. Krischik will also lecture in the ecology courses offered at                nearby Vassar College.                                                            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
