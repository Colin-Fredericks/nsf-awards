 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this research effort is to develop a pre-                fabrication engineering model of a high throughput VLSI systolic array          processing chip (or chip set) based on least-square (LS) QR                     decomposition algorithm.  This chip is being developed for general              systolic Kalman filtering applications.  An immediate application is to         improve the tracing accuracies and throughput currently achievable in           commercial Global Position Systems (GPS) receivers.  In Phase I, the            feasibility of developing systolic array LS architectures for high              throughput rate signal processors has been successfully demonstrated.           The systolic array design in Phase II is based on the modified Fast             Givens algorithm developed in Phase I.  The novel algorithm-based fault-        tolerant approach identified in Phase I is further developed to include         fault-identification and automatic reconfiguration based on inherent            parallel processing characteristics of the QR systolic arrays.                  Development of the pre-fabrication chip model requires determination of         the following VLSI design technologies for systolic processors:                 dependence graph mapping of algorithms to architecture, partitioning of         large size problems to fixed size architecture; tradeoffs on internal           and I/O lines; and software simulation of data flow and computations.           This Phase II research effort develops methodologies which can be               extended to general VLSI systolic LS processors and thus allow easy             future commercialization of this technology to other signal processing          applications.",
