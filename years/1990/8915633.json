 "awd_abstract_narration": "With NSF support the Principal Investigator has completed obser-                vations of an IRAS selected redshift survey, has performed sta-                 tistical analyses of this survey as well as other NSF supported                 redshift surveys, and has continued his investigations of the                   evolution of structure in the Universe via N-body techniques.                   This research is now to be extended in two directions:                                                                                                               (1) The redshift determination of IRAS selected galaxies will                   be extended to those with 60 micron flux greater than 1.2                       Janskys.                                                                        This will double the available sample size and permit much                      improved comparison to measurements of the peculiar velocity                    field of galaxies.                                                                                                                                              (2) The N-body investigations of the formation of structure                     in the Universe are to be continued.  Alternative techniques                    for inclusion of gas dynamical effects in the simulations will                  be investigated.  Inclusion of additional physical processes                    beyond gravitation will be a powerful tool for study of the                     formation of galaxies, as well as the cooling of hot gas in                     gravitational potentials comprised of baryonic and                              non-baryonic material.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Davis is a leading contributer to research on the theory and                observation of the large-scale structure of the universe.
