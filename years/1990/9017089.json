 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Conference on retinal proteins, which is                     anticipated to have 130-150 attendees, will permit scientists                   from the United States and abroad to discuss recent developments                and ideas regarding the structure, function, genetics, evolution,               and molecular mechanisms of light sensing and energy conversion                 by retinal proteins in prokaryotes, lower eukaryotes, and the                   visual rhodopsins of highly evolved eukaryotes.  Research on                    sensory and energy transduction mediated by retinal-containing                  chromoprotein pigments is currently underway in a large number of               laboratories in the United States, Europe, Japan, China and                     Israel.  A range of organisms among the archaebacteria, and                     eukaryotes are studied, especially with regard to energy                        conversion and chemo and photosensory transduction mechanisms.                  Approaches being taken are also very diverse.  They include                     behavioral studies, electrophysiology, genetics, biochemistry,                  spectroscopic, and molecular biophysical, ultrastructural, and                  immunocytochemical studies.  One of the purposes of this meeting                is to bring together investigators from many laboratories who use               a wide range of techniques to study molecular mechanisms of                     photo-sensory transduction and light energy conversion in a                     variety of systems, to compare results, and seek fundamental                    common principles.  Emerging homologies between the components of               sensory systems of microorganisms and higher eukaryotes make this               an opportune time to make detailed comparisons between higher and               lower organisms.  Accordingly, this meeting includes scientists                 who study photosensory transduction in systems ranging from the                 most primitive archaebacteria to higher vertebrates.  It                        includes also physiologists, biochemists and molecular                          geneticists, and biophysicists to present an integrated view of                 the problems. Thus it provides a rare opportunity for the                       participants, particularly the young scientists, to acquire a                   broad background in the field.",
