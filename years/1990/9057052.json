The 5-year continuing project, initiated in FY 90, will focus                   on the development of theoretical bases and earthquake                          engineering applications of stochastic processes.  Two major                    topics of study will be pursued.  (1) Stochastic Modeling of                    Plane Sources - Instead of traditional model treating the                       seismic dislocation source as points along a geological fault,                  a more refined and realistic plane model will be developed.                     A continous source region is divided into a finite number of                    point dislocation sources characterized by multiple correlated                  Poisson random processes.  The near field ground motions will                   be simulated by combining the deterministic wave propagation                    model and the random seismic source model.  (2) Sensitivity                     Analysis of Earthquake Response of Structures - The measure                     of the sensitivity for a structural system is defined by what                   is called a sensitivity function, which is a scaler for the                     variation of a single parameter in a single-output system; a                    vector for variations of multiple parameters in a single-                       output system; or a rectangular matrix for variations of                        multiple parameters in a multiple-output system.  The                           sensitivity with respect to the time domain variations of                       mass, stiffness and damping at the same time also will be                       investigated.  The sensitivity will be calculated from a set                    of sensitivity equations obtained from the governing                            differential equations.  For more complicated cases where                       multiple outputs are considered, numerical computation and                      simulation techniques will be used.                                                                                                                             Unlike the time domain analysis, the response sensitivity in                    the frequency domain is independent of the input signals.                       Four measures of sensitivity, namely, the Bode, Horowitz,                       comparison sensitivity functions and Root sensitivities will                    be examined.  These sensitivity analyses will be used to                        evaluate the performance of the control of earthquake excited                   structures.",
