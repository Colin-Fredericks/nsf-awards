 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fossil ferns of the Dakota Group will be studied in morphological             detail to determine their possible relationships.  The material will            be uncovered and macerated to extract the ferns, then the remains will          be subjected to various types of treatment to prepare them for light,           scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy.  As much                morphological information as possible will be obtained from these               ferns.  The localities will be recollected to obtain more material for          possible bulk maceration and then sorted for any fragments of plant             remains.  Once the information has been collected for the ferns, they           will be compared to closely related extant ferns and an analysis of             characters using cladistic methods will be done.  This analysis will            aid in assessing possible relationships, primitive character states,            and possible phylogenetic trees.  Relating this study to previous               studies of the ferns from the lower Cretaceous will make possible a             hypothesis as to the changes in the fern flora throughout the                   Cretaceous and the potential impact of the angiosperms upon these fern          floras.                                                                           The interactive component involves a combination of activities as a           professional researcher at the Florida State Museum and a professor in          the Department of Botany.  A seminar series cosponsored by the two              groups will be used to bring women scientists in plant evolution to             the university to present professional talks and to interact with the           students and staff.  Courses will be taught in the Department of                Botany and interpretative programs aimed at school students will be             offered at the Florida State Museum.                                              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
