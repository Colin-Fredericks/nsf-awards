 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides advanced Computer Science undergraduates with             laboratory experiences needed to broaden their knowledge of the                 principles of software engineering and \"programming-in-the-large\"               which they previously acquired only through class lectures and                  assigned reading.  This permits students to relate a sound                      theoretical understanding of software engineering techniques to                 laboratory assignments.                                                                                                                                         Funds have been provided to enhance and expand the current                      university-wide network of DEC machines so that students enrolled               in Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and other upper               level courses have access to the automated resources necessary for              the practical investigation of topics such as prototyping, the                  development and use of automated front-end life cycle tools, object             oriented design, and module reusability.  Further, students gain                hands-on familiarity with the software development techniques and               tools that they will use after they graduate.  The equipment                    permits students, through previously acquired software, to                      undertake and complete reasonably realistic projects more easily                and efficiently, thus allowing them to concentrate on broad general             aspects of software development.  The award is being matched by an              equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
