 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Trek of the Mammoth is a three-week multidisciplinary                       K-12 science educators' summer workshop based on a thematic                     unit about mammoths.  The Trek incorporates field study in a                    unique rural geographical region with classroom materials                       development.  Participants will study topics in field                           biology, environmental science and earth science with a major                   emphasis in science processes and cooperative learning                          groups.  During the Trek teachers will have an opportunity to                   observe actual scientists in the field doing research and to                    create specimen collections of their own.  In addition,                         participants will study Lakota ethno-botany and                                 ethno-astronomy and Lakota culture and beliefs, along with                      the special educational needs of all minorities.  Follow-up                     activities during the school year include a \"Video pen pal                      network\" for classrooms, a Science Fun Day and a Prehistoric                    Hunters of the High Plains olympiad.  Phase II is a                             three-year implementation program based on an NSF-funded                        one-year pilot Trek.  The Trek is designed to meet the needs                    of teachers who traditionally work with underserved and                         under-represented students including Native Americans,                          Hispanics and rural people.                                                                                                                                     An amount equivalent to 102% of the NSF contribution is                         included as cost-sharing.",
