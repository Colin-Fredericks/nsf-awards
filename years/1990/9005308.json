 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant photomorphogenesis is a complex developmental process under               the control of at least three distinct photoreceptors and involving             differential gene expression in both nuclear and organellar                     genomes.  During this process a characteristic \"greeting\" of place.             We are interested in understanding the biochemical and molecular                genetic control of chlorophyll formation in higher plants.  We have             identified cDNAs and/or cloned genomic sequences encoding three                 enzymes of the chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway.  These enzymes                 participate in this pathway either as regulatory (e.g., NADPH-                  protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (PCR) or non-rate-limiting steps             (e.g., ALA-dehydratase (ALAD), PBG deaminase (PBGD) and are thought             to be under phytochrome-mediated photoregulation either in a                    positive manner (ALAD), a negative manner (PCR), or to be                       unaffected by light (PBGD).  We propose to continue our                         characterization of the structure, complexity, and organization of              the gene families that encode these three chloroplast proteins.                 The expression characteristics of the individual family members                 will be analyzed with respect to light, extent of plastid                       differentiation and cell type.  Since substantial evidence                      supporting the presence of a dual pathway for tetrapyrrole                      formation in higher plants exists, we will determine whether                    individual members of these gene families give rise to proteins                 localized in different subcellular compartments (chloroplastic                  versus cytosolic) and if so, whether members of a gene family                   giving rise to proteins compartmentalized in different subcellular              locations are under different regulatory programs.                                                                                                              Green plants produce chlorophyll both in response to light in their             environment, and as part of their own normal developmental                      processes.  The control of chlorophyll biosynthesis is complex, but             poorly understood.  This is a proposal to elucidate that                        control.***",
