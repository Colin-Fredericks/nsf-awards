 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries Program Award will support                 Professors Vindell Hsu and Stanley N. Williams of Louisiana State               University in a research collaboration with several Colombian                   seismologists from the Colombian Volcano Observatory (OVC).  The                researchers intend to study the Nevado del Ruiz volcano by                      deploying 5 portable digital seismographs to supplement existing                analog stations.  The digital instruments will enhance the location             capability of an existing network so that seismic sources can be                better assessed for both their level of activity and their                      relations to magma chambers.  Another important phase of the                    cooperation is to deploy digital instruments directly above                     several seismically active areas that have been detected by the                 existing network.  By doing so, the researchers expect to record                digital data for analysis of source and/or path effects that may                be responsible for the various types of seismic signals recorded                at Nevado del Ruiz.                                                                                                                                             The researchers will work closely with Colombian seismologists who              will supply manpower as well as local logistical support.  The                  recorded data should help in the effort of modeling the various                 types of volcanic seismic events observed before and after the                  1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz and also surrounding the September             1, 1989 eruption.  Most important of all, the researchers will                  accumulate data about Ruiz which is quite unique and not yet                    thoroughly studied.  The effort should help in characterizing the               seismicity associated with the volcano and, therefore, be useful                in the future in terms of predicting eruptions at Ruiz and other                andesitic volcanoes.",
