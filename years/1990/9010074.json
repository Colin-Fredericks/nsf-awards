 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research approaches the study of human memory through the                  study of materials that are not distorted or changed in memory;                 it asks what properties afford these stimuli their stability.                   Such knowledge will not only advance theory, but will also                      provide guidance on how to prepare materials to be recalled more                accurately, especially for use in situations where written memory               aids cannot be used.                                                                                                                                            The research will focus on oral traditions which have been handed               down for generations without the aid of writing or other external               memory aids.  For instance, ballads currently sung on the coast                 and in the mountains of North Carolina differ only in minor ways                from the ballads folklorists collected in the British Isles                     hundreds of years ago.  This research will test singers who do                  not maintain the stability of their tradition by writing down the               old ballads and referring to them; rather, these singers keep the               ballads in memory and transmit them by word of mouth.  The                      singers do not learn the ballads in a rote tedious fashion, but                 rather use the rules and limitations of a good ballad to ease                   their memory load.  In sum, this research will study memory in a                natural context where it appears to be working in a near-optimal                fashion.                                                                                                                                                        The research will employ several methods.  One is analysis of                   ballads and folktales from existing North Carolina collections                  and those collected in previous research in terms of the meaning,               poetic, and musical constraints operating on the songs.  These                  constraints will be used to study the location and kind of                      changes that occur over historical time as well as within a                     single singer or story teller.  The research will investigate the               contribution to the overall stability of memory of each                         constraint, taken individually or in combination with other                     constraints.  Undergraduates who know little or nothing of the                  tradition will be asked to learn several ballads to see how their               skills at learning imporve with experience.  In this way, the                   development of expertise in learning new, highly structured                     material will be studied.                                                                                                                                       The research will explore differences that are due to the                       material being produced orally as opposed to in writing, both for               their theoretical and practical importance.  Undergraduates will                be asked to explain a complex situation either in speech or in                  writing under various conditions, and the research will analyze                 differences in the syntax, word choice, and overall organization                in these two situations.  Differences in production caused by the               mode of production have been demonstrated to be substantial.  The               research project will begin to look at mechanisms for these                     differences.",
