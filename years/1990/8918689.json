 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide the basic instrumentation and science                 analysis for the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGOs) that                are a new major research facility that has been developed by the                United States Antarctic Research Program (USARP).  The AGOs are                 very like satellites, in that they provide power, data collecting               capability and a comfortable environment for year long periods for              instruments that are designed to operate autonomously at remote                 sites in Antarctica.  The development of AGO has been a priority                of the US space physics community for more than fifteen years.                  Experiments other than those described in this abstract will also               be housed in the AGO system.                                                                                                                                    This project is a collaborative effort of the University of                     Maryland, University of New Hampshire, Stanford University,                     Augsburg College, New York City Technical College, AT&T Bell                    Laboratories, Lockheed Space and Missile Corporation and four                   Japanese institutions, Tohoku University, Tokai University, Kyoto               University and the (Japanese) National Institute of Polar                       Research.  The instruments to be deployed in the AGOs are search                coil and fluxgate magnetometers, a two wavelength monochromatic                 intensified all sky auroral imager using charged coupled device                 (CCD) technology, a newly developed imaging riometer and extremely              low frequency and very low frequency (ELF/VLF) radio receivers.                 The instrumentation closely resembles that deployed at several                  manned antarctic stations, including McMurdo and South Pole, as                 well as similar instruments in the Arctic.  It is also                          complementary to instruments on many orbiting and planned                       spacecraft.  Eventually six AGOs will be deployed by USARP.                                                                                                     The science will address a number of outstanding questions about                the high latitude polar ionosphere that are a major focus of                    global initiatives, especially STEP (Solar Terrestrial Energy                   Program) and ISTP (International Solar Terrestrial Program).                    The concept is to coordinate ground based measurements, aircraft,               rocket and balloon measurements, theory and modeling with the data              to be acquired by 13 new spacecraft missions to be launched by                  NASA, ISAS, ESA and IKI before 1995 and to incorporate, as well,                data taken from several satellites that are presently in orbit,                 should they still be providing data in the 1990.95 period.  STEP                is an international umbrella that covers the U.S. initiatives                   CEDAR, GEM, ISTP and Max '91.  The main goal of STEP will be to                 advance the quantitative understanding of the coupling mechanisms               that are responsible for the transfer of energy and mass from one               region of the solar.terrestrial system to another.                                                                                                              Specific AGO studies will include ionospheric signatures of                     magnetic cusp processes, improving understanding of the global                  convection pattern and magnetosphere.atmosphere electrodynamic                  coupling.",
