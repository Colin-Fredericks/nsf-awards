 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will extend (in both complex                    analytic and Lie theoretic directions) his previous work on                     analytically representing intersection cohomology of singular                   spaces by L2-cohomology.  In particular, he proposes to find                    complete Kaehler metrics on the smooth locus of projective                      varieties whose L2-cohomology represents the intersection                       cohomology of the singular variety.                                                  The principal investigator will extend ideas used in his                   solution to the Zucker conjecture to the case of complete Kaehler               metrics.  This conjecture stated that except in certain specified               cases, the L2- and intersection cohomology were essentially the                 same.  Cohomology is the dual of homology.  Thus, cohomology                    consists of a sequence of groups of functions which are tied                    together by a sequence of \"co-boundary\" functions.  These                       structures have been used to catalog hypersurfaces of many                      dimensions.",
