 "awd_abstract_narration": "The operation of the nervous system depends on nerve cells                      communicating with each other through a fine network of cellular                extensions known as axons and dendrites.  Axons are usually                     longer extensions and their initial growth constitutes one of the               crucial steps in determining the organization of the nervous                    system.  A growth associated protein, known as GAP-43, enriches                 axons of nerve cells and is associated with axonal growth.  While               the relationship of this protein to growth and the biochemistry                 of this protein have been well established, little is known about               the mechanisms that regulate the levels of GAP-43 in nerve cells.               Previous work has indicated that the amounts of this protein are                determined by the levels of messenger RNA, the intermediary                     molecule that links the activity of the gene with the synthesis                 of the protein.  The investigator plans to study how the                        expression of GAP-43 is regulated by focusing on messenger RNA                  regulation.  The levels of mRNA can be regulated at the level of                synthesis or at the level of degradation.  Preliminary work from                the investigator's laboratory indicates that the key control                    point in the expression of GAP-43 may not depend on the level of                synthesis but on the regulation of the stability of messenger                   RNA.  The study will determine to what extent synthesis and                     degradation mechanisms participate in the control of GAP-43 mRNA                levels during neuronal differentiation, in vivo and in cultures                 of isolated cells.  These studies will provide fundamental                      information on the mechanisms that govern GAP-43 levels which                   will set the basis for future studies on the specific molecular                 aspects of these regulatory events.  The elucidation of the                     mechanisms that regulate the expression of GAP-43  and other                    growth-related proteins will not only bring new insights into the               question of gene expression control during neuronal                             differentiation, but will contribute to the understanding of the                molecular events that underlie the development of the nervous                   system.",
