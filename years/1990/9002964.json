 "awd_abstract_narration": "The control of queueing (service) systems is increasingly important           in the areas of communication systems, computer networks, and                   manufacturing.  It is desired to determine control policies that are            optimal and easy to implement.  Underlying many queueing control                problems is a mathematical structure known as a Markov decision                 process (MDP).  Dr. Sennott will establish the existence of optimal             policies in general state space MDPs, in partially observable MDPs, in          MDPs with constraints, and in stochastic games.  Lastly, she will               study finite state approximations for infinite state MDPs.  Examples            illustrate the applicability of each topic to the control of queueing           systems.  The methods employed will be extensions of her developments           (1989a, b, c).                                                                    Interactive activities include teaching \"Modeling with Stochastic             Processes\" and \"Queueing Theory,\" and attending and speaking at                 departmental and graduate student seminars.                                       This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
