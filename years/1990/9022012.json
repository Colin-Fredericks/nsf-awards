 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to examine the ultimate causes of                          variability in the forceps of S.apicedentatus by estimating the                 potential for a further evolutionary response and clarifying                    evolutionary constraints on the evolution of earwig.  This will                 be accomplished by combining a partitioning and quantification of               selection with a quantitative genetic analyses of forceps                       morphology.  Computerized image analysis will be used to relate                 the morphological variability in forceps to success in intra and                intersexual interactions.  This provides a measure of relative                  fitness.  Quantitative genetic analysis that estimate                           heritabilities and genetic correlations will indicate potential                 genetic influences and constraints on variability.  The genetic                 analysis yields a measure of the potential for response to                      selection.  Combining the analysis of selection with the                        estimated response to selection will provide a detailed                         description of the evolution of forceps in S. apicedentatus.                    This, this study will provide a detailed analysis of the                        evolution of a sexually dimorphic structure.                                         In addition to this laboratory study, the PI will continue                 to collect preliminary field observations on the use of forceps                 by S. apicedentatus in the Sonoran desert of Arizona.  Thus, the                laboratory observations can be compared to a more natural                       situation.  In addition, the field work will also generate                      preliminary data for future comparative analyses of variability                 between populations and species, and information useful in                      designing future field studies of other species of earwigs.",
