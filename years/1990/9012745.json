 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei in the brain with                  major responsibility for causing movement of body parts.  To                    date, neuroscientists have been able to collect anecdotal data                  from these motor nuclei by recording either electrical or                       chemical events from single cells within the basal ganglia.                     However, this approach does not tell us what ensembles of cells                 within the nuclei are doing at one instance to effect a movement.               Thus, it is necessary to create and develop recording devices                   which will allow scientists to measure electrical and chemical                  events from multiple sites within a nucleus of cells if we are to               fully understand how neural circuits operate to cause an arm to                 move for example.  Dr. Greg Gerhardt is taking the initial steps                in the development of solid-state microsensors that can be used                 to monitor the neurochemical substratum of motor regulation.  He                plans to develop and test biosensors to monitor chemical and                    electrical events in \"real time\" in the extracellular environment               of striatal neurons.  He proposes to develop multichannel                       silicon-based biosensors for the rapid determination of dopamine,               glutamate, and acetylcholine activity in the basal ganglia of                   laboratory animals.  This work is extremely important, being at                 the cutting edge of research which will allow us to understand                  the neurochemical mechanisms that underlie execution and control                of brain motor circuits.",
