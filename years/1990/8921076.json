 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large single sea ice crystals were grown and evaluated for quality              in an earlier on year NSF Grant MSM-872294.  It has been determined             that these large single sea ice crystals can be grown at a large                enough rate to enable testing to be conducted on approximately 100              samples to determine the microstructural processes such as                      dislocation mechanics and microcrack damage of sea ice crystals.                The proposed work will be a follow-on to begin the routine crystal              growth process, initiate a comprehencsive testing program of single             sea ice crystals, and to develop a microstructurally based                      constitutive law for single crystals.  This constitutive law will               be formulated in terms of elastic strains, dislocation processes                and microcracking.  The overall program is aimed at determing the               properties of \"polycrystalline\" sea ice and to develop a better                 understanding of the variors deformation mechanisms in the                      deformation process.",
