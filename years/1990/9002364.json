 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the theory of quantales and                  their applications. It will utilize lattice theoretic and                       category theoretic methods to explore the general theory of these               partially ordered algebraic structures. The principal                           investigator will also consider applications to diverse areas                   such as ring and monoid theory, C*-algebras, and linear logic and               its use in theoretical computer science.                                             The research in this project involves category theory and                  its applications to problems in theoretical computer science.                   Traditionally, category theory has dealt with the foundations of                algebra; namely, it has focused on sets with algebraic structure,               mappings between sets that preserve that structure, and even more               abstract functors that relate the collections of algebraic                      structures and their mappings. In recent years, this research                   subject has enjoyed a rebirth in theoretical computer science.",
