 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds for 4 months of field work in                    Brazil, and 3 months in Switzerland for completion of a Ph.D.                   dissertation by Katia F. Rodrigues.  The study concerns                         endophytic fungi in leaflets of the Amazonian palm Euterpe                      oleracea mart. in Brazil and biochemical/nutritional studies of                 those fungi in Switzerland.  The work will be essentially                       taxonomic and ecological.  The following parameters will be                     considered: season, subsite, tree  age, leaf age, and tissue                    specificity.  The biochemical studies will be undertaken in                     collaboration with Dr. Orlando Petrini (Swiss Federal Institute                 of Technology, Zurich).  This research will result in a                         descriptive catalogue, with keys for identification, of the                     endophytic fungi found within leaves of E. oleracea. Endophytes                 found in trees grown in a wet versus a dry site will be compared                and a study of the distribution of endophytic fungi within plant                leaf tissues will be undertaken.  A biochemical study of the                    abilities of the endophytic fungi to produce cell-wall lysing                   enzymes, and phytoalexins is included.  The work will provide a                 database containing taxonomic and ecological characteristics of                 those fungi that will be available to other workers.",
