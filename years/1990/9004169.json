 "awd_abstract_narration": "The present proposal is centered on the study of two classes vof                Staphylococcus aureus host mutants which affect the replication                 of plasmid pT181.  The studies conducted so far on the                          characterization of these two classes of mutants have shown that                both illustrate new types of host-plasmid interactions.  The                    first class of mutations, exemplified by pcrA3, maintain plasmid                pT181 at a reduced copy number, without dramatically affecting                  its hereditary stability.  The pcrA mutations does not act by                   interfering with the plasmid control mechanism, and its effect                  can not be explained simply by a host factor limiting for plasmid               replication.  It was shown that in the pcrA host there is an                    accumulation of the plasmid pT181 Rep-origin replication                        initiation complex.  These results suggest that the pcrA gene                   product enables the plasmid replication initiation complex to                   make efficient use of the host enzymatic machinery for                          replication.  Several classes of plasmid mutations that affect                  the response to the pcrA3 mutation have been isolated and                       characterized.  A more detailed study of the pcrA3 mutations is                 proposed which will include in vivo and in vitro replication                    experiments as well as genetical studies. Work is in progress for               the cloning of the pcrA gene.  This will permit us to evaluate                  its role in the cell and will contribute to the understanding of                the way in which it affects plasmid pT181 replication.  The                     mutation placC1, representative of the second class which leads                 to the maintenance of plasmid pT181 at much increased copy                      number, was found to specifically affect the control mechanism of               this plasmid, by depressing the synthesis of the                                countertranscripts ( ctRNA), which act as negative effectors.                   The placC gene has been cloned and its sequencing is in progress.               The cloned wild type allele was found to complement the placC1                  allele present on the chromosome preventing the amplification of                plasmid pT181.  The isolation of the plaC gene makes possible the               study of its role in host metabolism and of the way in which its                expression is regulated.  The results to be obtained will help                  to determine what is the biological significance of the                         dependence of the pT181 ctRNA promoter upon the function of the                 plaC gene.",
