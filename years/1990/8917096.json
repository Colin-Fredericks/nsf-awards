 "awd_abstract_narration": "In insects, segmental identity is specified by the homeotic                     genes, which in Drosophila are found in two separate clusters                   (ANT-C and BX-C) and in the beetle Tribolium in a single one                    (HOM-C). These genes contain a conserved DNA sequence, the                      homeobox, which encodes a 60 amino acid DNA-binding region.                     Recent work on the mouse has resulted in the identification of                  four clusters of homeobox containing genes, the Hox genes, which                appear to be true homologues of the insect ANT-C plus BX-c, with                the same spatial organization along the chromosome and showing                  the same relative order of expression along the anterior-                       posterior axis. Similar clusters have been found in other                       vertebrates, including humans. While the function of the                        vertebrae genes is mostly unknown, the structural homologies of                 the Hox and HOM clusters have led to the proposal that an                       ancestral version of these gene clusters arose before the                       protostome-deuterostome evolutionary divergence and that it was                 involved in the specification of positional information during                  development. Dr. Macagno proposes to characterize the                           corresponding cluster (LOX-C) of these genes in a more primitive                invertebrate, the leech and to compare it to the insect and                     mammalian clusters in terms of structure, expression and                        organization, He has already identified several leech homeobox                  genes which are expressed in spatiotemporal patterns resembling                 those of vertebrate Hox and insect homeotic genes.                              %%%                                                                             This investigation will contribute to our understanding of the                  evolution and function of a set of genes important in                           morphogenesis.",
