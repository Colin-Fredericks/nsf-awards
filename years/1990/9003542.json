 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)                             spectroscopy offers the chemist one of the most powerful tools                  available for the study of the physical and chemical properties                 of materials.  Fundamental knowledge of structure and dynamics                  of materials as diverse as biopolymers, resins, coals, and                      liquid crystals is accessible by solid-state NMR techniques.                    Solid-state NMR studies often complement those carried out                      using solution NMR and X-ray analysis.  Access to solid-state                   NMR is rapidly becoming essential to chemists carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    and the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program will                     help the Department of Chemistry at the University of                           California in Santa Barbara, to acquire a high-field NMR                        spectrometer suitable for carrying out solid-state NMR studies.                 The areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                     acquisition include the following:                                                                                                                              Structural Characterization of Non-Oxidic Glasses by Modern                     Solid State NMR Techniques.
