 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth and differentiation in nearly all eukaryotic cells depends               on the metabolism and generation of energy by the mitochondrion.                Proper functioning of the mitochondrion involves an integrated                  system of both nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression.                       Cytoplasmic male sterility is one system in which tissue-specific               mitochondrial function and the role of nuclear factors on                       mitochondrial biogenesis can be studied.  Previous studies have                 identifed alterations in two loci, atp6 and atpA, that may be                   involved with male steriltiy in Ogura radish.  These alterations                will be characterized further by the following experiments:                                                                                                     1.   Western hybridization analysis, in organello translation,                  protein purification and NH2-terminal sequencing will be conducted              to investigate: A) the abundance of the ATP6, ATPA and an Ogura-                specific polypeptide, ORF105, B) the NH2-terminal sequence of ATP6,             and C) the effect of nuclear restorer loci on their expression.                                                                                                 2.   Biochemical and physiological studies (e.g. measurements of                ATPase activities, mitochondrial respiratory rates and membrane                 potentials) will be conducted on mitochondria isolated from normal,             and fertile and sterile Ogura radish plants in an attempt to                    identify in which processes Ogura mitochondria are dysfunctional                and if there is any correlation with the putative alterations                   identified by molecular analysis.                                                                                                                               3.   Genetic and molecular approaches (e.g. analysis of recombinant             mitochondrial genomes) will be utilized in an attempt to establish              a genetic, casual relationship between altered mitochondrial                    sequences and cytoplasmic male sterility.                                                                                                                       The relationship between mitochondrial function and cytoplasmic                 male sterility not only allows an understanding of the cells                    \"power plant\", the mitochondria, but also will reveal basic                     information about the development of the pollination mechanism.",
