 "awd_abstract_narration": "Secondary sexual traits are common in animals, and male                    traits are sometimes so strongly developed that they appear                     maladaptive.  What causes a particular combination of male traits               and female preferences in a given population, and why do                        populations evolve different combinations of traits?  The                       investigators are addressing this question in the guppy at                      several levels: the mechanisms of female choice, the effects of                 female choice on the evolution of color patterns within                         populations, and testing the prediction (from sexual selection                  theory) of co-divergence of female choice criteria and male                     traits among populations.                                                           This is a collaborative research effort with Anne Houde, New                Mexico State University.  They propose to explicitly test two                   major predictions from sexual selection theory.  First, they will               investigate the reciprocal evolution of male traits and female                  choice.  Second, they propose to explore the effects of the                     sensory drive process, and how this interacts with the evolution                of male traits and female choice.  In order to do this, they                    propose to carry out three long-term selection experiments which                should lead to long term genetic changes in female preferences                  and male traits.  One experiment selects for male traits and                    looks for evolution of female preferences.  Another selects for                 female preferences (via selection on spectral sensitivity) and                  looks for evolution of male traits.  The third modifies the                     perception of color patterns (to females and predators) by                      varying ambient light color and predator color vision, and looks                for changes in male traits and female preferences.                                   The proposed continuation of the investigators work will                   yield an unusually complete understanding of the processes which                affect the long term joint genetic change of female choice and                  secondary male traits under the influence of sexual selection and               predation.",
