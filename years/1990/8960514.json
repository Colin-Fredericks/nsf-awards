 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-               earth copper oxide ceramic systems has led to considerable                      research directed toward the development of electromagnetic                     components and devices.  However, the application of high                       critical temperature superconductors has been limited because of                crystal anisotropy of the randomly oriented grains in                           polycrystalline materials, grain boundary segregated phases and                 microcracking at the grain boundaries.  These factors have                      resulted in low critical current densities and high residual                    resistivity.  To address this problem, this research suggests                   laser-driven directional solidification of polycrystalline                      unsintered extrusions of high temperature superconducting                       materials under a controlled thermal gradient to produce highly                 anisotropic superconducting fibers having critical current                      densities.  The innovation contained in this work is the use of                 laser heating to minimized phase segregation by heating very                    rapidly through the two-phase incongruent melt region.  The                     technical objectives include developing a fiber extruder and a                  thermal gradient furnace, finding extruder operating conditions,                evaluating laser melt parameters, fabricating and characterizing                superconducting fibers and optimization of a proof-of-concept                   system.  The significance of the laser driven direction                         solidification technique lies in the cost-effective production of               high critical current density superconducting polycrystalline                   fibers.",
