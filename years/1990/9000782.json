 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU program will introduce thirty talented undergraduates to                research in the field of membrane science.  Ten students from                   eight Kentucky colleges and universities are matched with five                  faculty advisors.  The individual projects are designed along the               lines of the research program of the supervising advisor to                     ensure direct scientific interaction with the graduate and                      postdoctoral students of each research group.  Weekly seminars                  during the summer and evening seminars in the fall stimulate                    discussion and provide information on career possibilities as                   well as on current major research issues, experimental                          methodologies and specialized instrumentation.  Program emphasis                is placed on literature searching and analysis techniques, on                   critical evaluation of each individuals experimental data, and on               the development of effective scientific communication skills.                   Student presentations on their projects complete the program.",
