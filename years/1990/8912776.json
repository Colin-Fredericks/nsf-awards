 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Ken Kennedy and others in his group at            Rice University to maintain collaboration in computer science research          with Professor Hans Zima now of the University of Vienna.  The Rice             University team has been working for several years on a programming             environment for distributed-memory machines as part of the \"ParaScope\"          project.  Simultaneously, Professor Zima has been building a similar            static data partitioning system, called SUPERB, for the SUPRENUM                project.  During a sabbatical visit at Rice, the collaborators                  developed an enhanced system that moves toward dynamic partititioning           that increases adaptability.  Their design uses annotations to a                FORTRAN program written in a data partitioning language.  The user              provides the annotation.  The underlying compilation system then                translates the FORTRAN program to a distributed memory program that             employs the data assignment strategy specified by the annotations.                                                                                              Lack of efficient compiling programs for parallel and distributed               hardware stands in the way of effective use of the new distributed              computing resources by scientists in many disciplines.  The principal           research of the Rice group in this area is supported by an NSF grant            to a Science and Technology Center there.  Maintaining active                   collaboration with Professor Zima, now that he has returned to                  Europe, will be an inexpensive and valuable enhancement to the                  Texas-based work.",
