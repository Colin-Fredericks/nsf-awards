The objective is to obtain data on the                                          performance of five soil nailed walls in the                                    San Francisco Bay area during the Loma Prieta                                   earthquake.  This perishable data will be                                       compared at a later time with the pre-                                          earthquake measurements on the same walls, in                                   order to evaluate the performance of soil                                       nailed walls under seismic conditions.                                                                                                                          Soil nailing is a construction procedure used                                   to shore vertical soil cuts for temporary or                                    permanent purposes.  Related procedures                                         included conventional soldier pile and tie-                                     back systems.  Because of the uncertainties                                     involved with the design of soil nailed                                         walls, building officials have expressed                                        concern regarding soil nailing (Engineering                                     News Record, October 5, 1898).  As a result,                                    Professor Felio was appointed Chairman of the                                   American Society of Civil Engineers-Los                                         Angeles Section Task Committee on Soil                                          Nailing in order to establish design,                                           construction, and monitoring guidelines for                                     the City of Los Angeles.  This committee has                                    been collecting information on the subject as                                   well as contacting researchers, constructors,                                   and designers in the United States for                                          information.
