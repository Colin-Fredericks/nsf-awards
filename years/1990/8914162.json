The                             objectives of the workshop include:  review of the                              state-of-the-art methods in risk assessment and emergency                       preparedness related to the use of hazardous materials in                       large quantities by the chemical and petroleum industries;                      improve quantification aspects of risk assessment dealing                       with engineering failures, health effects and dispersion                        modeling; and develop strategies for emergency preparedness                     related to accidents involving toxic/inflammable                                materials.  It is expected that a transfer of knowledge to                      various user agencies will be accomplished.  Four technical                     sessions will deal with:  engineering aspects of risk                           assessment; health effects aspects of risk assessment;                          transfer and fate of toxic air pollutants vis-a-vis                             dispersion modeling and risk management.  The Indian                            co-director is     Dr. M.P. Singh, Head, Centre for                             Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology,                           (IIT), New Delhi.                                                                                                                                               Scope:  The idea of this topic for a workshop was one of                        the recommendations of a workshop on risk assessment                            techniques and management held at IIT Delhi in October                          1987.  The idea was later endorsed by the Indo-U.S.                             Subcommission on Science and Technology in its November                         1987 meeting.  The topic is clearly of great interest to                        heavily industrialized countries such as the U.S. and also                      to countries with large populations and increasing                              industries such as India as evidenced by the incidents in                       Bhopal, Chernobyl and Mexico City.  The workshop is likely                      to provide better scientific basis for decision-making to                       prevent major disasters and to deal with situations after                       accidents.  The workshop is likely to benefit scientists in                     the U.S. and India",
