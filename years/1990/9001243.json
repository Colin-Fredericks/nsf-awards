 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alluvial terrace and valley deposits are important sources of              information about environmental changes, but the complex ways in which          processes operate within river valleys and also in upstream and                 downstream areas makes interpretation of sediments difficult.  Also             troublesome are problems in assuring that the dating of sediments is            accurate.  Radiocarbon-dating methods have somewhat alleviated the              latter difficulties, but comprehensive analyses of the dynamics of              valley sedimentation based on more accurate chronologies have not been          undertaken in many settings.  This doctoral dissertation research               project will develop a detailed chronology of alluvial change over the          last 25,000 for the lower Colorado River valley of the Texas coastal            plain.  The chronology and analyses will be based on field mapping, on          radiocarbon dating of important stratigraphic sections, and on                  reconstruction of depositional environments and sedimentary provenance          for all stratigraphic units.  The lower Colorado alluvial record will           be compared with radiocarbon-controlled sequences from the upper                Colorado River drainage basin and with records of sea-level rise and            shoreline change along the Gulf of Mexico to address the relative roles         of upstream, downstream, and internal factors as influences on the              development of fluvial landforms in the lower Colorado valley.                       This project will provide valuable information about the timing            and processes of landscape change in the study area.  Because research          methods to be used in this locale have been used elsewhere, this case           study will contribute toward comparative analyses of regional landscape         evolution and paleoenvironmental change.  It also will provide an               excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
