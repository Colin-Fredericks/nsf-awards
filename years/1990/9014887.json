 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a cultural                   anthropologist from the University of Hawaii who will study the                 role of remittances as a household strategy in Tonga, a small                   Polynesian kingdom.  Remittances, meaning money sent to relatives               by migrant workers in other countries, are increasingly important               in many Third World countries.  This research will identify the                 extent to which migration and remittances are employed as a                     strategy to meet household goals; will document how remittance                  income is incorporated into the village economy; and will analyze               how remittances affect village social organization.  Methods used               include participant observation, archival research on government                statistics, formal life-history interviews with villagers, and a                survey of household resources.                                                                                                                                  This research will illuminate the role of remittances in the                    economic life of the local community from which the emigrants                   departed.  It will provide useful information to people concerned               about the impact of remittance income on poor societies as well                 as the values and concerns that impel certain individuals to                    migrate while others stay home.  This kind of knowledge can                     generalize to help us understand migration within one country                   (i.e., between north and south USA) as well as between countries.",
