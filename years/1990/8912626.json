 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Karl A. Gingerich to collaborate with Dr.               Winfried Schulze and Dr. D. M. Kolb of the Fritz Haber Institute of             the Max Planck Gesellschaft, Berlin, FRG, in spectroscopic studies of           the reactions of metal clusters ranging in size from two atoms to               colloidal particles.  With Dr. Schulze, he will investigate the                 dependence of the electronic and vibrational energy levels on cluster           size, the stability of neutral and charged clusters and of their                specific reactivity using a wide variety of modern research                     techniques.  Specific systems to be studied include clusters of                 lithium, iron and nickel, and their interactions with nitrogen and              carbon monoxide in low temperature matrices and in the gas phase.               With Dr. Kolb, he will measure the optical  spectra of molecules such           as Germanium, Aluminum and Gallium.  These molecules have been or are           being studied by equilibrium mass spectrometry at Texas A & M to                obtain their bond energies.                                                                                                                                     Dr. Schulze's group is concerned with the preparation, characteri-              zation and reactions of metal clusters.  They have extensive                    experience in optical and vibrational studies of matrix-isolated                metals and metallic clusters.  Also, they have refined the gas                  aggregation technique to generate metal clusters in narrow size                 distributions and in high intensities, including colloidal sizes.               Dr. Kolb's group is concerned with fundamental aspects of matrix                isolation spectroscopy of metal atoms and small clusters, using                 optical spectroscopy as their principal analytical tool.  A major               objective of their work is to improve fundamental understanding of              matrix effects on electronic transitions and geometry.  Dr.                     Gingerich's research has involved using equilibrium mass spectroscopy           to study the bond energies of small inorganic molecules, most of them           diatomic metals and small metallic clusters that are important in               catalytic processes.  Through collaboration, he will gain more                  experience in the preparation and spectroscopic study of metal                  clusters larger than the ones he has been investigating. He also                will learn techniques for studying their reactivity and catalytic               action.  In view of the development of laser spectroscopy and the               extablishment of a Surface Science Center at Texas A & M, this                  experience will lay the groundwork for extending his research on metal          clusters into catalysis and surface science oriented studies.",
