The school emphasizes the interdisciplinary                   nature of the three fields of condensed matter, particle                        physics, and cosmology.  The areas to be covered include                        introduction to functional methods, topological structures and                  their applications to condensed matter and particle physics,                    anomalies, dynamical symmetry breaking, superconductivity and                   two-dimensional conformal field theories.  Lecturers are                        expected from the U.S., Western Europe and the USSR.  Students                  come from six cuntries in Asia including China, India,                          Pakistan, Bangledesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.                                                                                                                      Scope:   The exposure of students and young researchers from                    Asian countries to the lectures by eminent scientists from                      around the world greatly strengthens the scientific potential                   in these countries, and fosters scientific cooperation between                  them and with the U.S.  This meeting is the second in a seies,                  following a 1989 meeting that proved successful by the                          excellent participation from the U.S. and Europe, and with                      partial support from the International Centre for Theorectical                  Physics, Trieste, Italy.",
