In this                    proposal, they discuss two such problems which have the common                  feature that the partial degree of spatial coherence is important               in understanding the physical behavior.  1) Interest in                         quasicrystals has recently grown, due to the discovery of new                   materials which are much more highly ordered than previously                    known samples, raising important new questions about the atomic                 structure and disorder in these materials.  In particular, they                 will determine the phase diagrams and diffraction lineshapes of                 quasicrystalline alloys.  2) They will study the growth of atomic               layers and epitaxial interfaces on surfaces, with an eye to                     understanding whether there are kinetic universality classes that               govern scaling behavior.  Both of these research topics are well                matched to the experimental techniques of high-resolution X-ray                 scattering.",
