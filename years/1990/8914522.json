 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborate research between Dr. Bob                    Buchanan, University of California at Berkeley and Dr. M. Miginiac-             Maslow, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay.  The overall goal of the                project is to relate the structure and function of the newly                    identified extrachloroplastic thioredoxin h of leaves and other                 plant tissues and of the m-type thioredoxins present in the green               eukaryotic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.  Theoredoxins are low-               molecular-weight proteins that are widely distributed in nature.                                                                                                In pursuing the proposed work, the investigators will identify the              structural domains involved in the interaction of thioredoxins with             different target enzymes.  They plan to perform site-directed                   mutagenesis experiments to confer different activities (specifici-              ties) to the higher plant and algal thioredoxins and convert them               to either a more bacterial or animal-like character.  These                     results will provide insight into the structural features that                  determine the specificity of thioredoxins, not only of plants, but              also of animals and bacteria.  Research from this study will add                fundamental new knowledge to several fields, including biochemistry,            medicine and biotechnology.  The complementary interests and                    expertise of the Berkeley and Orsay groups, together with their                 long-standing record of successful scientific cooperation, will                 help insure the success of the proposed research.",
