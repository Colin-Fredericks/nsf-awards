 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional DBMSs are passive: they execute queries or                          transactions only when explicitly requested to do so by a user                  or an application program. Many non-traditional applications,                   such as CIM, process control, hospital monitoring systems, air                  traffic control, and office workflow control, which require                     timely response to (critical) situations are not well served by                 these passive DBMSs.  For these applications, it is important to                monitor conditions defined on the states of the database, and                   then, when these conditions occur, invoke specified actions.                                                                                                    This project advances previous work on active databases by the PI               by i) consolidating earlier research on active databases and ii)                extending the active database paradigm to efficiently support                   non-traditional applications requiring distributed workstation                  configuration. This extension helps in intelligently staging the                data between the database and one or more workstations and also                 provides a mechanism for update propagation. Distributed                        condition monitoring is investigated to achieve the above.                                                                                                      The results of this research will relieve the application                       programmer at the workstation from the management of shared data                between the workstation and the database as well as maintaining                 the consistency of shared data. This research is aimed at                       providing 'staging transparency' at the user level using active                 database as an underlying abstraction.",
