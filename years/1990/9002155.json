 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Ramsey theory and graph                theory of Professor Igor Kriz of the University of Chicago. Dr.                 Kriz has proposed to study major questions of well-partial-                     ordering theory in connection with Ramsey theory. Specifically,                 he will attempt to generalize the Robertson-Seymour graph-minor                 theorem to the case of infinite graphs, and will continue his                   investigations of ordinal invariants in well-partial-ordering                   theory and Ramsey theory.                                                            This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
