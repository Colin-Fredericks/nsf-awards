 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad goal of this research is to identify design                      principles and methods that exploit both the form and functional                structure of devices.  Four approaches to design assistance based               on form-function relationships are being investigated.  Form-                   function characteristics of components are used to abstract high                level design relationships.  Secondly, device level form-function               relationships are derived from the aggregation of component level               behaviors in a way that considers the context and resolution of                 the design stage.  Thirdly, device level characteristics are used               to determine dominant design relationships.  And fourthly, a                    synthesis strategy is based on the opportunistic utilization of                 component functionality.  This program of research leads to the                 observation that form-function characteristics of mechanical                    components and devices exists and can be identified from physical               principles.  Furthermore, design decisions are dominated by                     considerations having to do with form and function.  These                      observations have led to the development and implementation of                  specific design representations and strategies which are being                  evaluated for their utility in the preliminary design of simple                 electro-mechanical devices.",
