 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                          Chemistry Program.  New techniques for the synthesis of                         naturally occurring medium or long chain peptides are being                     developed which will make them rapidly available in multi-gram                  quantities for testing purposes.                                                                                                                                New synthetic techniques based on base- and solvent-sensitive                   amino-protecting groups promise to make available quickly                       multi-gram quantities of shorter peptides and to markedly                       improve the synthesis of small quantities of longer peptides.                   Methods for the synthesis of long peptide chains of 100 or more                 amino acid units which involve the coupling of segments enjoy                   significant advantages over those involving stepwise                            approaches.  Three methods for assembling the appropriate                       segments will be studied:  (a) the FMOC/Polyamine solution                      technique, (b) the two polymer (\"inverse merrifield\") approach                  and (c) the standard Merrifield solid phase method.  In all                     three approaches the applicability of newly-discovered FMOC                     amino acid fluorides as rapid-acting, inexpensive coupling                      agents will be studied.  Such reagents are now available for                    all but four of the common amino acids.  Synthesis of                           appropriate acid fluoride reagents for these four compounds                     (Arg, Asn, Gln, His) will be developed.  To facilitate solid                    phase syntheses two special resin supports will be                              investigated:  (a) tertiary alcohol resins which should                         completely inhibit loss of peptide from the resin due to                        diketopiperazine formation at the depeptide stage, especially                   in the case of C-terminal or penultimate proline or glycine and                 (b) resin supports bearing tertiary aminoalcohol functions                      which should serve to catalyse loading of the first amino acid                  and thereby promote complete on-line automated syntheses from                   the first to the last amino acid.  Once rapid, routine methods                  for the synthesis of protected segments are available, both                     solution and solid phase methods of segment coupling will be                    examined.  A novel method of effecting racemization-free                        segment coupling involving protection of the C-terminal amide                   bond by FM-bar or a related amide protectant will be pursued.                   The model chosen to study the application of these techniques                   is a 19-unit segment of a silkworm prothoracicotropic hormone,                  PTTH-II-(1-19).",
