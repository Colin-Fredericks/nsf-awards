 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Baringo Basin in the Rift Valley of East Africa has been               one of the most productive areas in the world for finding                       hominoid fossils from the important period of 4-14 million years                ago (mya).  Reconstructing paleoenvironments for this period is                 highly relevant to determining whether development of open                      landscapes should be considered a pivotal driving mechanism                     during this period in human history.  Paleohabitat reconstruction               can provide proximate causes for divergence and subsequent                      radiation of the Hominidae.  In particular, Late Miocene and                    Pliocene sediments exposed along the eastern flanks of the Tugen                Hills, west of Lake Baringo, have yielded extensive fossil                      vertebrate assemblages including 6 of the 11 unequivocal hominoid               specimens known from Africa in this time range.  These exposures                provide a unique opportunity to establish a detailed                            environmental-ecological context in which change in human fossils               over time may be assessed.  Preliminary isotopic data and                       previous analyses of fossil fauna suggest major alteration of the               Tugen Hills habitat between 6 mya and 9 mya.  This research will                provide high resolution stratigraphic, geochemical, and                         paleontologic data collected from horizons in the 2-12 mya                      interval which will be used to reconstruct aspects of                           paleohabitat and paleocommunity and to determine more precisely                 the timing and nature of environmental change in the Baringo                    Basin.",
