 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of employment and commuting patterns in American                   metropolises have disclosed that women generally work at jobs closer            to their homes and spend less time commuting than men.  Most of these           studies as considered women as a homogeneous group.  The degree to              which other economic, social, and ethnic factors may explain these              general variations therefore is not well understood.  This project will         focus on an analysis of differences in work locations and commuting             patterns among women from different racial and ethnic groups.  The              focus of the project will be development of a path-analytic model that          distinguishes the effects of economic, household, and transportation            characteristics on commuting time among people in different gender and          racial/ethnic groups.  The model will then be tested using statistical          analyses of Public Use Microdata Sample census data for the New York            Consolidated Statistical Area.                                                       This project will contribute to our specific knowledge about the           dynamics of commuting patterns within the New York metropolitan area, a         region of exceedingly complex economic, social, racial, and ethnic              interaction.  More importantly, it will add to our general insights             about the factors that influence commuting and the relationships                between the locations of jobs and homesites in modern metropolises, and         it will enhance our understandings about the impact of gender on the            spatial activity of individuals and groups.",
