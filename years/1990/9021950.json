 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop which assesses the status of                     and identifies research needs and opportunities in the                          field of intelligent control systems.  Many of the topics                       addressed at the meeting have a direct bearing on research                      supported by the Dynamic Systems and Control Program as                         well as other programs in the Engineering and CISE                              directorates.  Specifically, the theory of intelligent                          control systems, the formulation and application of                             intelligent control systems, knowledge based control                            systems, and software/hardware issues for real time                             intelligent control are included in the workshop topics.                        Support of this proposal satisfies, in part, several key                        NSF goals including strengthening cooperation between                           industry and university researchers, and aiding in the                          transfer of technology from the research level to the                           users.  It also represents cooperation between a government                     research agency and an independent organization on research                     of mutual interest to the two entitles involved.  The                           workshop objective is to develop a better understanding of                      specific research needs, and to identify specific research                      areas whose exploitation will be instrumental in achieving                      the full potential of intelligent control systems.",
