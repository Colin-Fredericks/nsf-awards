 "awd_abstract_narration": "In mammals generally, and in meadow voles in particular,                   males tend to move greater distances than females between their                 place of birth and the location of their initial breeding                       attempt.  Considerable controversy exists over the cause or                     causes of this pattern of movement known as male-biased natal                   dispersal.  One explanation, the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis,               states that the sexes move different distances to avoid mating                  with close relatives because of the potentially deleterious                     effects of inbreeding.  A second possibility, the competition-                  for-mates hypothesis, suggests that competition among males for                 mates causes male-biased dispersal.                                                  This study proposes to experimentally examine these 2                      hypotheses.  Laboratory-reared meadow voles will be released into               small, uniform patches of grassland habitat, and their dispersal                from these patches will be monitored.  Sibling groups will be                   released into some plots and non-sibling groups into other plots.               These groups will consist of either 3 males and 1 female or 3                   females and 1 male.  Greater dispersal from patches containing                  siblings will support inbreeding avoidance as a cause of                        dispersal patterns in mammals, whereas dispersal from patches                   with male-biased sex ratios will suggest competition for mates is               important.  This proposed study is one of the first to test                     experimentally these 2 hypotheses.  It should provide valuable                  information concerning why male mammals tend to disperse greater                distance than females.",
