The main questions to be addressed concern how to promote theory change.        The investigator will focus on three factors:  (1) making the textbook          theory intelligible in spite of students' misconceptions; (2) providing         students with metaconceptual understanding of the nature of scientific          knowledge; and (3) designing the curriculum taking into account the             process of differentiation itself.  Given that the differentiation              appears to proceed in specific stages the curricular sequence should be         chosen to optimize the transition from one stage to the next.                                                                                                   Two classroom studies (Studies 1 and 4) explore the use of multiple             computer-implemented, interactive, visual models in making the textbook         theory accessible to ninth graders by comparing a model-based curriculum        to a more standard one based on the laws from experimental and                  problem-solving applying the newly learned laws.  Study 4 also examines         the effect of metaconceptual knowledge on the reconceptualization at the        content level.  Two studies (Studies 2 and 3) explore the process of            differentiation induced by a computer model in individual students over         a one-month period.  The project will develop prototype teaching                materials (software, curriculum and a teacher guide) based on these             models.",
