 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the reactions of atmospheric nitrogen                   compounds with components of airborne sea salt, and of the                      chemistry of the gaseous products of these reactions.  It is                    designed to clarify questions of atmospheric composition in                     coastal regions and of the possible impact of there reactions on                tropospheric ozone in the Arctic.                                                    Laboratory studies will be conducted to measure the absolute               kinetics of the reactions of HNO3, NO2 and N2O5 with NaCl and                   NaBr.  Whether these reactions continue to occur when the salts                 are dissolved in ice will also be determined and compared to the                reactions of HBr in ice.  The photochemistry of the newly                       discovered gaseous BrNO2 and the atmospherically relevant                       kinetics and mechanisms of reaction of ClNO2 will also be                       determined.  The results of these experimental studies will then                be used to quantitatively assess the importance of these                        heterogeneous gas-solid reactions in the chemistry of regional                  polluted areas, as well as remote areas such as the Arctic.",
