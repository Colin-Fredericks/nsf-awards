 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project began as an attempt to establish the systematics                   of the stable isotopes of Be and Al in the oceans with a view                   to using their cosmogenic radio-isotopes as geochronologic                      tools.  There is an explicit analogy here to C-14.  Carbon is                   involved in the biogeochemical cycle; hence the effect of decay                 on the distribution of the radio-isotope is overprinted by non-                 radiogenic processes.  However the stable isotope C-12 is                       affected only by the biogenic processes and hence can be used                   to correct for their effects on the radio-isotope.  The success                 of this approach is greatly facilitated by the fact that the                    carbon isotopes share a common, well-mixed reservior, the                       atmosphere.  The latter is known not to be the case for Be and                  Al.  The objective of this project is to establish whether the                  residence time and chemical behaviours of these elements in                     seawater is such that isotope equilibrium is achieved in the                    oceanic reserviour.  If this were true, then direct radiometric                 dating of marine sediments would be feasible in the range 0 to                  -15 million years.                                                                                                                                              Support is requested to complete the first phase of the                         investigations concerning the geochemical cycle Al with a view                  to developing Al and Be isotopes as geochronometers.  The                       effort will extend coverage into several new basins in the                      South Atlantic and examine the evolution of the isotope                         distribution as the Atlantic water masses propagate from their                  northern source                                                                 8915831                                                                         Measures                                                                                                                                                        This project began as an attempt to establish the systematics                   of the stable isotopes of Be and Al in the oceans with a view                   to using their cosmogenic radio-isotopes as geochronologic                      tools.
