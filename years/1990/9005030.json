 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research objectives are the development of a detailed and                  semi-continuous isotopic record for the late Paleozoic Era and                  the testing of its accuracy, and 2) the application of isotope                  stratigraphy to paleoenvironmental analysis with the specific                   goal of determining the origin of late Paleozoic cyclical                       sedimentary deposits.  These two objectives are inseparable since               understanding the depositional environment is vital for                         interpreting the isotopic record.  The study employs stringent                  measures to avoid sampling diagenetically altered material.                     Brachiopod shells are separated from shale matrix, embedded in                  epoxy, and thin-sectioned.  Photographs of these thin sections                  are taken under cathodoluminescence and plane light, and used as                a map to sample non-luminescent calcite from the thin section                   with a dental pick.  Electron microprobe elemental analysis of                  select shells is used to confirm the use of cathodoluminescence                 to identify altered shell.  The study will concentrate on a                     limited number of brachiopod species, thereby minimizing or                     eliminating biological effects on isotopic composition.                         Sedimentological and paleontological data will also been                        collected, providing independent evidence for paleoenvironmental                change.  PIs will analyze brachiopods from late Pennsylvanian                   deposits in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri to examine                lateral variations in isotopic composition 1) to test the                       possibility of using 13C to correlate strata and 2) to define                   lateral and temporal gradients in ocean paleotemperature and                    chemistry.  PIs will also extend the isotope stratigraphy of the                late Paleozoic in Texas to examine paleoenvironmental changes in                the epicontinental seas of Texas and to provide a detailed and                  accurate isotope stratigraphy which can be used as the standard                 for other studies of stable isotopes in late Paleozoic fossils.                 Project will apply innovative techniques to analysis of global                  environmental change in a period of earth history much like                     today's.  Analyses of global change in this time of climatic                    change may reveal information about the causes, rates and                       consequences of climate change.",
