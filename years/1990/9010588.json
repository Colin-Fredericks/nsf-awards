 "awd_abstract_narration": "Defense against predators is one of the most important survival                 skills for any animal.  In many species, newborn individuals must               be able to recognize potential enemies and to exhibit effective                 antipredator behavior.  However, little is known about how these                behaviors develop.  Animals lacking parental care have no                       opportunity to learn effective behaviors from adults and thus are               ideal for investigating how behaviors are individually acquired                 in nature.  Dr. Herzog's experiments will investigate how an                    important class of behavioral tactics, antipredator responses,                  are learned under natural conditions.                                                                                                                           Using garter snakes, a species with virtually no parental care,                 this research will investigate aspects of the control,                          modification, and evolution of defensive behaviors.                             Specifically, Dr. Herzog will examine how animals learn to                      recognize predators, the types of experience that cause                         modifications of antipredator strategies, and how genes influence               the ability of animals to learn new responses.  The \"predators\"                 in the experiments will be lifelike models, and no animal will be               harmed in the course of the research.                                                                                                                           The research will enhance knowledge of the evolution of learning                ability and of the processes that enable very young animals to                  adapt to hostile environmental contingencies.",
