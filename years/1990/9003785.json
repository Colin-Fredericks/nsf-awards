Local soil/geologic conditions can modify                                       incoming earthquake strong-motions wave                                         trains, causing them to be more damaging.  It                                   is well accepted that this effect occurred                                      during the Loma Prieta earthquake.  Much can                                    be learned about site-specific seismic                                          response using the wealth of strong-motion                                      data recorded during this earthquake.  But in                                   order to understand the observed seismic                                        response, a necessary first step is to define                                   the area's stratigraphy as precisely as                                         possible.  This is the objective of this                                        research program.                                                                                                                                               This project seeks to obtain and to analyze                                     all available data on the stratigraphy of the                                   Pleistocene fill, the depth to the basement                                     rock, and to tabulate all measured physical                                     properties of the Pleistocene units for                                         correlation with expectable ranges in                                           velocity propagation.  The aim is to prepare                                    precise stratigraphic fence diagrams, unit                                      isopach maps, and to tabulate physical                                          properties and downhole testing data for each                                   geologic unit penetrated.  These data form a                                    first step for other studies, such as in                                        defining the seismic response for the                                           Oakland-Alameda Bay Bridge area.",
