 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Stanley Ambrose, Professor of                        Anthropology at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Ms. Nancy                   Sikes will carry out a combined program of field and laboratory                 analysis to collect data for her doctoral dissertation.  The twin               goals of her project are to develop techniques for reconstructing               past vegetation communities and then apply them to significant                  archaeological sites in East Africa.  She will focus on the                     analysis of carbon isotopes in organic components of soil.                      Plants utilize different metabolic pathways and as a result,                    contain different ratios of carbon isotopes.  Since such                        vegetation provides the main organic component in soil, different               soils may vary in isotope ratio based on the vegetation they                    sustained.  Preliminary analysis suggests it is possible to work                backwards from soil to plant community.                                                                                                                         Ms. Sikes will study a number of soils in East Africa.  Following               an altitudinal gradient she will note modern plant cover and then               collect associated soil.  After isotope analysis she will try to                determine different types of signatures.  On this basis she will                then study samples from two important archaeological sites:                     Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and Olorgessalie which is located in                  central Kenya.  Long-term work at both sites has yielded                        extensive samples of early hominid cultural remains.  To                        interpret the activities which took place and, therefore, gain                  insight into hominid adaptations, it is necessary to establish                  the environmental context, and Ms. Sikes analyses should provide                a basis.                                                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                develop a technique of use in a wide range of archaeological                    situations.  It will also provide insight into how early humans                 lived.  Finally, it will further the training of an extremely                   promising young scientist.",
