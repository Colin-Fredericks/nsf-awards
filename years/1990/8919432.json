 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science network user community of the National Air and                    Space Administration and the National Science Foundation largely                overlap, so it is advantageous for the two networking                           organizatons to be closey coordinated in order to minimize                      duplication of facilities, reduce duplicate and wasteful efforts,               and control overall costs for the agencies.  This project will                  provide the means whereby NASA program management can effectively               collaborate with and contribute to the networking program of NSF,               especially in view of the leading role that NSF has taken                       regarding the National Research and Education network.                                                                                                            Specifically, NASA would participate with NSF in the                          development and implementation of networking workshops, seminars                and studies.  This project also calls for NASA support of NSFNET                reviews and hearings, for NASA participation in international                   network collaborations, and for NASA consultation on national                   network directions and management issues.***",
