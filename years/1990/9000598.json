 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States and the Soviet Union are probably the                         two leading countries in both astrophysics and cosmology.                       Cooperative research in these areas, however, have not                          been common in the past.  This workshop will provide an                         important opportunity to strongly stimulate long-term                           joint cooperation in an area of research which is of                            great interest to the world-wide scientific community.                                                                                                          The thematic focus of the workshop, which is being                              organized by Dr. Adrian L. Melott of the University of                          Kansas and Dr. Sergey F. Shandarin of the Institute of                          Physical Problems of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences,                          is the legacy of Yakov B. Zel'dovich in Astrophysics and                        Cosmology.  One of the most important figures in                                twentieth-century cosmology, Zel'dovich (who died in                            1987) was responsible for fundamental advances in these                         areas that are being actively investigated today.  The                          workshop will involve some 10 to 15 scientists from each                        country, including 5-10 young investigators from each                           side.  The workshop will include an opening session on                          the future of cosmology, which will be open to the                              public and oriented to their understanding, as well as a                        three-day scientific program will consist of a series of                        brief presentations followed by extended discussion                             periods.  Selected observers will be permitted to                               attend.  Participants will be invited to use the final                          day for the development of collaborative relationships                          and preparation of specific proposals for long-term                             cooperative research for subsequent submission and                              competitive review.                                                                                                                                             This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complemen-                        tary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual                         interest and competence in the field of basic scientific                        research on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and                             mutuality of benefit.",
