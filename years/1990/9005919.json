 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to a cultural anthropologist and an ecologist at the                 University of Southern California will support their research on                a complex irrigation system in Bali.  In a previous project the                 PIs developed a computer simulation model of the irrigation                     system in a broad area, and analyzed the role of religious                      priests in managing the flow of water so as to coordinate the                   activities of different sub-regions to limit pest damage and                    stimulate increased rice production.  The model called for a vast               amount of precise data about the actual flows of water, rainfall,               crop production and other variables, and this award will allow                  the PIs to return to Bali to work with local water engineers and                personnel to set up a large program of data gathering.  The end                 result will be a more precise test and specification of the                     model, which should allow local experts to manage the system                    better.                                                                                                                                                         This research is important because it shows the role of native                  religious specialists in economic production, and will help                     develop analytical systems to increase our understanding of the                 function of regional irrigation systems in traditional societies.               Any increase in understanding of how such food production systems               work, especially when they are so different from our own (i.e.,                 involving religious experts), can potentially help alleviate the                world food problem.",
