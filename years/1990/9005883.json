 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Robert                   Drennan has conducted wide-scale archaeological site survey and                 limited test excavations in the Valle de la Plata which is                      located in the Alto Magdalena region of Colombia.  This area is                 particularly famous for the remarkable corpus of sculpture                      attributed to the \"San Agustin culture.\"  These                                 characteristically are associated with stone tombs and include                  grinning human faces with feline fangs and larger than life-size                human figures.  Because these materials were usually recovered                  through looting, their original context is often unknown.  In the               course of his research, Dr. Drennan has traced the rise of San                  Agustin culture from the first millennium B.C., through ca. 700                 A.D. when production of statues and tombs reaches a peak, and                   into a later period when variation in burial custom indicates                   marked status variation.  Through this process he is able to                    trace the rise of social differentiation and the development of a               large-scale chiefly society.                                                                                                                                    In his current project, Dr. Drennan will continue this work.  He                will analyze ceramics collected, expand a soil study to determine               agricultural potential, analyze the relationship between                        settlement distribution and agricultural resources, date                        radiocarbon samples, and identify carbonized plant remains.                     Through this work he will gain increased insight into chronology                as well as the settlement and subsistence practices of this                     prehistoric group.                                                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons.  Archaeologists                 who work in Middle and South America are extremely interested in                the data which Dr. Drennan will produce.  The results will                      increase our understanding of how social complexity develops and                chiefdom level societies arise and are maintained.  Finally,                    because it includes graduate students, this research will aid in                the training of young scientists.",
