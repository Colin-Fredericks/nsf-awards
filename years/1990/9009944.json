 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies are being conducted which if successful will demonstrate the            feasibility of universities fabricating in a few hours their own low-           cost prototype multichip modules (MCM).  MCMs represent a state-of-the-         art microsystems packaging technique, improving speed and power by              factors of three or more.  Current industrial MCM fabrication costs are         prohibitive in prototype quantities to universities.  The cost reduction        and short turnaround time offered by this novel concept along with other        fast prototyping methodologies have the potential to revolutionize              microsystems design.                                                                                                                                            The concept is to have standard pattern substrates mass produced by             industry at low cost.  Each substrate would have buried patterns of             power and ground wiring, plus a buried level of signal wiring.  All             buried wiring would have strategically placed paths called vias to a            surface layer.  This surface layer would be a pattern of wiring                 including connections to the vias which could be cut by the universities        to customize for a particular design.  Pretested bare chips with solder         bumps would be bonded to the customized substrate to form the customized        module.                                                                                                                                                         The concept is being demonstrated by 1) designing, fabricating and              testing the substrates and two types of memory MCMs, 2) functional              design only of two other complex modules.",
