 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of our nations's graduating electrical engineering seniors                 have not been challenged to integrate their knowledge obtained                  from a diverse range of course work.  This critical problem is                  addressed by a pilot project for the establishment of a new                     capstone laboratory course and its associated Laboratory for                    Dynamic System Integration for teachings seniors system                         integration concepts.  The new laboratory consists of a network of six          modularized lab stations.  Each lab station consist of a SUN                    3/140 workstation, a 6-axis PUMA 260-series robot arm, and                      CCD camera with a vision processing unit.  The Ethernet connection              ties all the equipment together, to the file server and the                     engineering-wide computer network as well.  The objectives and                  salient features of this laboratory course are:                                      o    To provide a capstone experience for undergraduate                              students in electrical engineering.                                        o    To utilize the state-of-the-art computer-controlled                             robotic systems with integrated vision sensors (CCD                             cameras) as an instructional vehicle for educating                              undergraduate students in systems integration concepts.                    o    To provide a system facility for some undergraduate                             independent projects and future course development.                                                                                                   Since all the equipment is commercially available, this experience              can be shared with other universities.  The results of this pilot               project will be reported in professional journals.",
