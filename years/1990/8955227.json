 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two institutes for secondary school physics teachers will be                    conducted at Westminster College, one in the summer of 1990,                    the second a year later.  At each of these three-week                           workshops, 20 teachers will learn about topics in modern                        physics, take part in hands-on activities involving modern                      physics, and develop teaching units on modern physics                           concepts.                                                                                                                                                       The content will center on Particle Physics, as understood in                   terms of the Standard Model, and its relation to everyday                       events as well as its implications for cosmology.  The                          Standard Model describes the structure of all matter in terms                   of a few fundamental particles (quarks and leptons).                            Opportunities will be provided to review basic concepts in                      preparation for this study.                                                                                                                                     Participants will come from the region comprised of western                     and central Pennsylvania, western New York, eastern Ohio,                       northern West Virginia, and western Maryland.  Selection will                   be based on the applicants' interest in modern physics and                      commitment to incorporate modern physics topics in their                        courses.  Applications from minorities and women are                            encouraged.  Participants will receive a $900 stipend, room                     and board, and a selection of modern physics teaching                           materials.  They also will earn three semester hours of                         graduate credit.                                                                                                                                                Institute activities will include lectures and discussions,                     review sessions, films and video tapes, and hands-on                            activities involving laboratory and demonstration apparatus,                    computer simulations and modern physics \"games\".  Several new                   modern physics teaching aids will be introduced including                       \"The Fundamental Particles and Interactions Wall Chart\" and                     the notebook, \"Topics in Teaching Modern Physics Teacher                        Resource Materials\".  There will be field trips to the                          Cornell Electron Storage Ring accelerator at Cornell and to                     the Proton Decay Experiment near Cleveland.  Participants                       will develop two teaching units on modern physics for                           incorporation into their curriculum and will share                              experiences and report on progress at local conferences to be                   held in the Spring of 1991 and Spring 1992.                                                                                                                     Cost sharing in an amount of $55,724 equals 36% of the NSF                      award.",
