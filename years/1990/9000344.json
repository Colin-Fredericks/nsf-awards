 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is funding this research.  Dr.                    Meyers will continue his very fruitful development of new                       methods for synthesizing optically active materials.  Many of                   the molecules used in treating diseases are optically active                    and this work has the potential to provide new routes for their                 synthesis.                                                                                                                                                      Metalation of chiral formamidines using butyllithiums, followed                 by alkylation with various electrophiles, gives C-C bonds                       adjacent to nitrogen in very high enantioselectivity.  This                     process has now entered the advanced stage whereby complex                      alkaloids and other nitrogen-containing substances are being                    explored.                                                                                                                                                       Future efforts will center on quaternary carbon derivatives and                 attempts to reach a number of spiroisoquinoline alkaloids in                    high enantiomeric excess.  A search for more efficient and                      readily available chiral auxiliaries will also be undertaken to                 increase the % ee's of the quaternary alkylated products.                                                                                                       In addition to the quaternary carbon stereocenters, asymmetric                  total syntheses will be attempted at suitable targets of                        biological importance.  Other studies will focus on mechanistic                 aspects of this process using Li-NMR, molecular modeling, and                   isotopic derivatives in an effort to clarify the nature and                     reactivity of the organolithium intermediates.  Finally,                        mechanistic information, already in hand, has provided a clue                   that facile resolutions may be accomplished as an alternative                   means of reaching these optically active amines.",
