 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Susan McIntosh, Ms. Helen Haskell will                conduct archaeological survey and excavation in the Mema or \"Dead               Delta\" region of Mali.  The results of this work will form the                  basis for her doctoral dissertation.  The Mema, as                              geomorphological data indicates, was once a well watered region                 which coincided with the inland delta of the Niger River.  A                    change in the river's course has turned the region to desert.                   The small amount of archaeological research which has been done                 in the region indicates that it contains archaeological sites                   which probably span several millennia.  They include at least two               which document the transition from a pure hunting and gathering                 existence to one which incorporated livestock and domesticated                  plants.  The goal of Ms. Haskell's research is to shed light on                 this transition period.  Guiding herself with aerial photographs,               Ms. Haskell will conduct a vehicle survey of the region, noting                 both ancient landforms and scatters of archaeological materials.                In conjunction, these data will provide information on                          prehistoric landscape use.  She will also conduct test                          excavations at two sites and collect pottery, stone tools, and                  other cultural remains as well as floral and faunal materials.                                                                                                  This project is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  fill in what is almost a complete archaeological blank.  It will                provide information on how cultures at a very simple level of                   technology adapted to a rigorous Saharan environment and,                       hopefully, shed light on the introduction of agriculture and                    pastoralism to sub-Saharan Africa.  Finally, it will aid in the                 training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
