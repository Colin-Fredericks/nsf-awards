 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells secrete prepackaged hormones and neurotransmitters by a                   process known as exocytosis.  This process plays an important                   role in the function of most organ systems in the body.  For                    example, the pancreas secretes hormones that regulate blood                     sugar.  Secretion of neurotransmitters is the means by which the                nervous system controls a whole host of function, including heart               rate, blood pressure, breathing, and muscle movement.  Despite                  its obvious importance, exocytosis is poorly understood.  We know               a great deal about the signaling systems which initiate the                     process, but very little about what happens at the biochemical                  level once secretion is triggered.  In a resting secretory cell,                hormones or neurotransmitters are stored in small, membrane-                    covered vesicles, waiting for an appropriate signal.  During                    exocytosis, these vesicles make their way to the surface of the                 cell, where they bind and fuse with the cell membrane, releasing                their contents outside the cell.  Although it seems likely that                 one or more proteins participate in this process, it has proved                 difficult to demonstrate this experimentally.  This proposal                    takes a new approach toward identifying such proteins.  It takes                advantage of the fact that certain bacterial toxins can partially               or totally block one of the later stages of the secretory                       process.  Although the exact mechanism by which the inhibition                  occurs is unknown, it almost certainly involves an interaction                  with the proteins which are of interest to us.  I plan to use                   radiolabeled toxin interact.  I will then purify these proteins                 and determine their subcellular localization and functions will                 markedly increase our understanding of, and thus our potential                  ability to control, the process of exocytosis.  Eventually, these               studies may lead to novel therapeutic approaches towards diseases               such as hypertension which have a prominent secretory component.",
