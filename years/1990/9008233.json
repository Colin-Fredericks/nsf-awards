 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differential geometry of infinite dimensional manifolds is                 basic to the study of quantum field theory.  The principal                      investigator will extend his results on iterated integrals and                  the Witten current for the Dirac operator developed under the                   previous grant to the setting of supersymmetric conformal field                 theory.  He will continue his development of analytic tools for                 loop spaces.  These include logarithmic Sobolev inequalities,                   singular integral estimates, deRham cohomology and the Feynman-                 Kac formula.  Lastly, he will investigate applications of Connes'               theory of non-commutative differential geometry including links                 to quantum field theory.                                                             Classical field theory involves assigning to each point of                 four-dimensional space-time a vector or scalar quantity such as                 the electrical field or temperature.  In quantum field theory                   usually some sort of operator or function is assigned to each                   point in space-time.  Using inner products, from these operators                an observable quantity may result which then can be checked by                  repeated experimentation.  In this project subtle properties of                 quantum fields will be investigated using infinite dimensional                  hypersurfaces and a mathematician's tool known as loop spaces.",
