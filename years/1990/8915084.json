 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent evidence has indicated that the availability of iron                may limit phytoplankton biomass and primary production in many                  oceanographic regions.  Iron is a key component of the                          photosynthetic electron transport chain; reductions in the rate                 and efficiency of photosynthesis are expected when phytoplankton                growth is iron-limited.                                                              In the fellowship research, biophysical, biochemical and                   immunological techniques will be used to examine the phenotypic                 response of the photosynthetic apparatus of marine phytoplankton                to iron deficiency under controlled conditions in iron-limited                  chemostat cultures.  Interspecific comparisons will be made                     between organisms from two taxonomic groups, a diatom and a                     coccolothophorid.                                                                    The concentrations of the PS I reaction center chlorophyll                 (P700), the cytochrome b complex and the soluble electron                       carriers ferredoxin and flavodoxin will be measured                             spectrophotometrically.  Oxygen flash yields will be used to                    determine the concentration of active PS II reaction centers, and               flash fluorescence techniques will be used to determine the                     fraction of total PS II reaction centers which are active.                      Polyclonal antibodies from marine algae or higher plants will be                used to determine the relative abundances of the carboxylating                  enzyme ribulose biphosphate carboxylase, the thylakoid ATP                      synthetase, several components of the PS II reaction center                     complex and light harvesting complex proteins.",
