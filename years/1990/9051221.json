 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of the special-purpose graphics processor, graphics             system design is feasible in a university undergraduate                         environment.  This project serves to strengthen the curriculum in               the areas of graphics, image processing, microprocessor-based                   design, and capstone design through the creation of a graphics                  system design laboratory facility and the creation of a new                     graphics design course.  The facility and the new course are based              on the TMS34010 graphics processor.  The equipment required                     includes eight student stations where the design, testing,                      debugging and documentation of laboratory exercises take place.                 The laboratory course consists of a series of structured exercises              culminating in a term project which integrates all of the preceding             exercises into a graphics system.  This provides for teaching                   state-of-the-art graphics system design, as well as fundamental                 microprocessor-based design.  The award is being matched by an                  equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
