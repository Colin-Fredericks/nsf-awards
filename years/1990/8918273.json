 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakes in many areas of the world now receive considerable                  inputs of sulfate from acid deposition.  Giblin, Peterson, and                  Fry previously focused on the biogeochemical changes that occur                 in lakes due to increased sulfate loading.  Their work revealed                 that some of the existing paradigms on how the sulfur cycle in                  lakes functions may need to be modified. The investigators now                  have evidence from both laboratory incubations and sediment                     profiles that carbon limits sulfate reduction in some lakes. in                 this proposal the investigators focus on several questions that                 are a direct outgrowth of their previous work.  These are: 1) How               widespread is carbon limitation of sulfur storage in lake                       sediments? 2) How does eutrophication influence the amounts and                 forms of sulfur stored in lake sediments? 3) Does iron                          availability effect sulfur storage in sediments in many lakes?                       The investigators propose a multifaceted experimental                      approach that includes the measurement of sediment element                      profiles from a variety of lakes, metabolic studies at the whole                lake level, and the experimental manipulation of variables in                   field and laboratory settings.  This balanced approach should                   allow robust conclusions about responses of the C,N,Fe, and P                   cycles to changes in sulfate loading, and how these responses are               altered by eutrophication.                                                           This research is being conducted by a highly qualified team                from an outstanding institution.  The results of this work will                 provide important knowledge for understanding the responses of                  lakes to eutrophication and acid precipitation.",
