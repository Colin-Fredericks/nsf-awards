 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the research of a cultural anthropologist               in developing a large database (over 200 cases) of irrigation                   systems from about 20 nations.  These cases will be measured on                 several variables, including size and structure of authority.                   Previous work show no relationship between size and political                   centralization between 700 and 458,000 Hectares.  The                           relationship between size and structure of authority will be                    investigated in the new and larger sample.  Additional variables                include information on climate, nature of irrigation, type of                   agriculture, and type of national political system, should                      account for some of the variation. Results should be of interest                to management theorists and policy makers who must deal with                    irrigation projects which are not performing up to standards.",
