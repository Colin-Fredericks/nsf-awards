 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Canadian Shield is an extensive bedrock plain of low                   relief that covers the northern United States and most of Canada.               The exposed rocks are among the oldest on earth and were formed                 generally at elevated temperatures and pressures.  The topo-                    graphic shield was formed by a broad uplift of the North American               continent between about 1.6 and 0.5 billion years ago.  The                     cause and timing of uplift is unknown:  the only direct evidence                for uplift is the presence of a 1 billion year erosional hiatus.                The objective of this project is to reconstruct the uplift                      history of the shield during this erosional hiatus by measuring                 the apatite fission track cooling histories of surface samples                  collected from the shield in Ontario and adjacent areas.  Results               are expected to constrain the timing and rate of uplift which are               important clues to the causes of the widespread uplift.",
