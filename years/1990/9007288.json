 "awd_abstract_narration": "The survival and growth of woody plants in dryland regions                 of the United States depends on their ability to withstand tissue               dehydration during drought.  It is particularly important that                  the cells specialized in transporting water (xylem vessels) from                the soil to leaves remain functional and that the water column                  not be disrupted by air bubbles (embolism).  In higher plants the               introduction of air bubbles into xylem vessels results in a                     blockage of water transport and, if extensive enough, kills the                 plant.  Laboratory experiments indicate that one of the major                   cases of xylem embolism is severe water stress during extended                  periods of drought.  However, very little is known about the                    occurrence and significance of embolism in nature.  No data are                 available for dryland plants where tissue water stress is great                 and thus where embolism may be the most significant.  The                       objective of this proposed study is to provide the first                        information on the role of xylem embolism in plant growth,                      productivity, and survival of dryland plants, specifically                      chaparral shrubs indigenous to California.  This project will                   shed light on the dynamics of water relations in chaparral                      vegetation, especially during the early phases of recovery after                wildfire.  This knowledge could potentially lead to an improved                 management of chaparral as a water shed, as a deterrent of soil                 erosion/landslides as a cove for wild animals and as a browse for               livestock.",
