 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near threshold scattering is a very important problem in                        quantum collision theory.  The LFCC method, although                            accurate, is not applicable to all but simplest molecules                       (e.g. H2).  The AN theory, on the other hand, seems to                          breakdown near threshold.  We have devised a First-Order                        Non-Degenerate Adiabatic (FONDA) theory which is not as                         demanding as LFCC method but is more accurate than AN                           theory near threshold.  The FONDA theory has been applied                       to H2 molecule, with model and separable exchange, and the                      results are very encouraging.                                                                                                                                   The first phase of this proposal would be to improve the                        FONDA cross section for vibrational excitations of H2 near                      threshold by including more vibrational states of the                           target molecule in the construction of the K matrix.                            Reformulation the FONDA theory in terms of the T matrix                         boundary conditions will also be considered.  The second                        phase is to implement direct exchange in the FONDA theory.                      Finally in the last phase of this project, this theory                          will be applied to N2 molecule.",
