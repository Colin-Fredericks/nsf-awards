 "awd_abstract_narration": "To be considered intelligent, machines must be capable of                       learning.  Symbolic and neural approaches to machine learning                   both have been heavily investigated.  However, there has been                   little research into the synergies achievable by combining these                two learning paradigms.  This work will develop a hybrid system                 that combines the symbolically-oriented explanation-based                       learning paradigm with the neural back-propagation algorithm.  In               this system, the initial neural network configuration is                        determined by the generalized explanation of the solution to a                  specific classification of planning task.  This research                        addresses the problem of choosing a good initial neural network                 configuration and overcomes problems that arise when using                      imperfect theories to build explanations.  Most real-world                      problems can never be formalized exactly.  However, there is much               to be gained by utilizing the capability to reason approximately                correctly.  Explanation-based learning provides a way to                        profitably use casual models of the world, while neural networks                provide a way to refine roughly-correct concepts.  This research                on combining these two learning paradigms promises to broaden the               applicability of machine learning techniques, producing learning                algorithms that are not brittle and which can produce concepts                  whose accuracy improves through experience.",
