Twenty-           five faculty are participating, primarily from four year and graduate           institutions in the upper Midwest.The activities include a five-day             workshop.  A June 1990 and a one-day follow-up meeting in the spring of         1991 are being held at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater.  Dr.             Carl Pomerance is speaking at the workshop and presenting ten one-hour          expository lectures on various topics.  The topics have applications in         number theory, public key cryptosystems and situations where primarily          testing or the factorization of large numbers are important.                    Participants are expected and encouraged to incorporate the topics into         their classes and will report on their experiences at the spring 1991           follow-up meeting.",
