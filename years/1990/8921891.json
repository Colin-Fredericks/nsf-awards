 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subglass relaxation processes, resulting from molecular motions                 in otherwise glassy solids, occur commonly in amorphous polymers                and in the amorphous fraction of semicrystalline ones.  They have               been presumed to be due to localized conformational motions                     decoupled from the longer range segmental motions associated with               the glass transition.  In appropriate circumstances, both                       reorientation of flexible side groups and local conformational                  mobility in the main chain have been proposed as mechanisms.                    However there is little direct evidence that these notions are                  correct.  The present research will take advantage of dielectric                relaxation data recently collected on systems deliberately chosen               to be good model systems for side group relaxation and of recent                progress made in the atomistic simulation of the packing and                    properties of bulk amorphous systems in developing a detailed                   molecular model for subglass relaxation due to flexible side                    group motion.  Motions of pendant ester groups will be modelled                 in a bulk multi-chain environment.  Similar modelling will be                   carried out for a relaxation of the local main chain type, the                  gamma relaxation in polyethylene.  Previously suggested local                   motions will be modelled in an atomistic bulk environment and                   other localized motions will be sought as well.  In other                       research, advantage will be taken of the ability to make                        dielectric measurements over a broader frequency or time range to               experimentally investigate the shapes of a number of types of                   relaxation processes and to assess the ability of various                       phenomenological equations to represent the shapes.  Since an                   important part of the research involves numerically intensive                   computing, efforts will also be made in the area of improved                    simulation techniques.",
