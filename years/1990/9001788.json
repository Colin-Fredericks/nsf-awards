 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to continue research in several areas of                  nonlinear applied dynamics.  Excitable systems---systems which                  can be triggered by a small stimulus---arise as models of several               physiological and chemical phenomena.  It is proposed to study                  such systems, with an emphasis on understanding the periodic and                aperiodic behavior that is seen.  Another project is studying                   models of polymerization reactors with multiple initiators, in                  collaboration with some chemical engineers.  The emphasis is to                 model industrial processes as completely as possible and                        understand behaviors of reactors under different operating                      conditions so as to effect control, and in particular, prevent                  catastrophic runaway of reactors.  It is also proposed to                       continue work on understanding the stability of standing-and                    travelling-wave solutions of parabolic differential equations.",
