 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long range objective of the Computer Science Department                at Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus, by means of the                    five-year infrastructure grant (II-MI), is to build research,                   educational, and experimental laboratory capabilities in the area               of post-conventional relational DBMS technology VIZ, knowledge                  base management systems (KBMS) and object-oriented data base                    management systems (00-DBMS).  Research activities in these areas               will focus on the development of models, techniques and tools                   for extending (or transforming) conventional relational database                systems.  Implementation of these extensions, in the form of                    interfaces or modifications to the conventional relational data                 base system, will be carried out in an experimental computer                    laboratory located within the department.  These research and                   implementation activities will coupled with and feedback to the                 computer science curriculum.                                                         The curriculum will be enhanced to include advanced material               and new courses in disciplines related to these research                        activities (eg, advanced artificial intelligence, advanced data                 base systems, expert and knowledge base systems, expert and                     knowledge base systems, object-oriented programming and object                  oriented-system design).  In addition, a Laboratory Research                    Projects Course will be introduced whereby some of the extensions               and modifications, resulting from research activities, will be                  implemented.  Research and implementation activities will be                    conducted by Department faculty with the close cooperation and                  assistance of Ph.D granting Computer Science Departments in the                 metropolitan area, viz, Polytechnic University, New York                        University and/or Columbia University.",
