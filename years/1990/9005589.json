 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dramatic cell differentiation undergone by Naegleria gruberi,               from amoebae to flagellates, is unique as a model system in the                 rapidity, synchrony, reproducibility, homogeneity, and                          Accessibility of a major phenotypic change.                                     Differentiation-specific molecules synthesized during this change               include two calmodulins, one that becomes localized in the                      flagella and the other that remains in the cell body.  Cloning                  and sequencing of the single flagellar calmodulin gene revealed                 provocative structural features that may be implicated in                       regulation of its programmed transcription, in the stability of                 its mRNA, and in the localization of its protein.  In order to                  test these possibilities, and to make this system advantageous                  for other studies, this laboratory is working vigorously to                     obtain DNA-mediated transformation of Naegleria. In addition,                   initial searches for DNA clones to cell body calmodulin have led                to the discovery of two additional calcium-binding protein genes                expressed during differentiation.  One encodes a calcineurin                    B-like protein; the other and undefined calcium-binding protein                 whose gene sequence is related to flagellar calmodulin DNA but                  which is expressed earlier in differentiation.  The goals of this               research are to find the calmodulin-2 gene and to dissect these                 multiple calmodulin-like proteins in Naegleria, while continuing                to seek DNA-mediated transformation in this remarkable organism.                                                                                                The unicellular eukaryote, Naegleria gruberi reproduces as                      amoebae.  If conditions are suitable, the amoebae undergo a                     rapid, dramatic differentiation into lively, swimming flagellates               with a fixed, streamlined body contour.  The flagellates are                    temporary, do not reproduce, and eventually revert back to                      amoebae.  The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the               sequence of events (from environmental trigger, through                         programmed changes in gene expression, to localization of                       differentiation-specific gene products) that underlie these                     differentiation events.  The current goals of this project are to               identify and characterize genes for proteins involved in the                    regulation of cellular functions by calcium.  Since the genes for               these regulatory molecules are expressed differently at different               stages of the differentiation process in different parts of the                 organism, it is likely that they represent an important link in                 this chain of events.",
