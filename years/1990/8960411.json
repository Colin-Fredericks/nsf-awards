 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I award provides funds to develop a software                    package for the processing of macromolecular diffraction data                   from electronic position-sensitive area detectors, with                         particular application to data from high-flux storage ring x-ray                sources.  Existing packages of software are either geared toward                data from conventional laboratory x-ray sources or have been                    tested in a limited number of sites.  The proposers' XENGEN                     software package has been widely used and tested and could be                   readily adapted to the high-flux, storage ring context.  The                    research involves extending this package to allow it to handle                  more kinds of crystallographic data than it can currently handle,               with particular attention to its application to storage-ring                    data.  The extensions of the existing software must allow it to                 deal with new classes of statistical objects and with different                 types of experimental conditions.  The research effort will                     consist of analyzing those new contexts, writing and documenting                the new software, and testing the software in conventional                      contexts and with data from detectors at storage rings.  The                    result will be a software package capable of handling diffraction               data from conventional x-ray sources and from storage rings when                used in monochromatic or multiple-wavelength modes; the types of                area detectors for which the software could be used include                     multiwire proportional counters, SIT tube television detectors,                 and charge coupled device detectors.  Genex intends to license                  and distribute the software to laboratories and regional                        facilities in the United States and abroad.",
