 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pinnipeds are an important group of marine mammals,                        comprising the walruses, sea lions, and seals.  Nevertheless,                   their evolutionary relationships to each other and to other                     mammals remain unclear.  Dr. Annalisa Berta is a vertebrate                     paleontologist studying the anatomy of fossil and living                        pinnipeds for the purpose of reconstructing their evolutionary                  history.  Her research also considers the functional capabilities               of fossilized species, providing unique insight into the                        evolution of behavior in the group, and its transformation from                 terrestrial ancestors.  Dr. Berta proposes to continue her                      investigations into the evolutionary relationships among                        pinnipeds using morphological data from fossils.  The present                   project will focus on the phocids, a possible sister-group to the               walruses.  Cranial and post-cranial material from the Oligocene-                Miocene of coastal Oregon will be examined, and locomotor                       capabilities (principally forelimb versus hindlimb propulsion)                  estimated.  This project represents a logical extension of a                    previous award that supported study of the otarioid pinnipeds                   (walruses, sea lions, but not seals).                                                The proposed research has implications for a wide scientific               audience.  Comparative anatomists and vertebrate zoologists will                welcome the new data derived from early Tertiary fossils, along                 with new reconstructions of evolutionary relationships of major                 mammalian groups.  Functional morphologists will look to this                   study for critical information on alternative adaptations to                    life in aquatic habitats.  Evolutionary biologists will integrate               these findings with recent results based on DNA sequence data,                  resulting in an unusually detailed understanding of this                        noteworthy group.",
