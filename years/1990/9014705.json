 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to concerns about health-related problems associated           with the drift of agricultural pesticides to people located near                application sites, safer, more concentrated means of application have           been developed.  Major questions remain unanswered regarding the degree         to which people are still exposed to chronic, low-level amounts of              pesticides.  This project will evaluate of data on pesticide                    applications, weather patterns, and population patterns from sites in           California, Ohio, and New Jersey to test three hypotheses related to            the impacts of agricultural pesticides on suburban residential                  populations:  (1) Traditional analyses of pesticide drift as a hazard           only when acute, high-level exposures occur underestimates levels of            potential chronic, low-level exposures, (2) suburban development into           agricultural areas magnifies possibilities for chronic, low-level               exposures, and (3) demographics patterns further increase risks because         suburban populations usually have higher proportions of children and            young adults, which are the groups most vulnerable to chronic pesticide         exposures.                                                                           This project will significantly enhance our knowledge of the               dynamics by which pesticide drift affects nearby populations by                 relating data from different sources in three representative but                distinctive sites.  The research also will provide valuable new                 insights that can be used to evaluate current and prospective policies          regarding pesticide application and urban development, and it will              provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
