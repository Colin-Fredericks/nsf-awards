 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in membrane fluidity at low, but non-freezing temperatures, are         thought to be involved in chilling injury, a physiological disorder             that effects many economically important plants.  Recent research has           shown that the chilling sensitivity of some susceptible plant tissue is         reduced by exposure to ethanol, a mild anesthetic.  Some anesthetics            are known to increase membrane fluidity and thereby lower the                   temperature at which cold-induced phase transition occurs.  In                  contrast, elevated atmospheric gas pressures reduce membrane fluidity           and raise the temperature at which cold-induced phase transition                occurs.                                                                                                                                                         Singular and combined effects of anesthetics and high-pressure gas              atmospheres on symptoms of chilling injury (induced ion leakage,                stimulated respiration, and stimulated ethylene production) will be             examined in seedlings.  Results will provide an understanding of how            these two factors can be used to manipulate chilling response and               ultimately an experimental approach to dissection of the mechanisms             that lead to plant adaptation to chilling temperatures.",
