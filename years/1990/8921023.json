 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most viral diseases, of man, his livestock, and crops are                       caused by viruses having RNA genomes.  Despite the obvious                      importance, remarkably little is known about the molecular                      processes of RNA viral replication.  Recombinant DNA                            techniques have provided procedures for addressing the                          problem, one of these being the ability to engineer cDNA                        copies of viral RNAs.  Transcription of RNA in vitro from                       cDNAs of wild-type viral sequences has, in several cases,                       yielded infectious RNA.  Mutagenesis at the cDNA level is                       relatively facile, and RNA transcripts of such altered clones                   can serve as specific mutants at the RNA level.  Sequences                      with striking resemblance to the internal promoters of tRNA                     genes, internal control regions (ICRs), also termed A and B                     boxes, have recently been observed at the 5' termini of the                     genomic RNAs of brome mosaic virus (BMV)and other viruses.                      The 5' terminal location, their partial homology to the                         recently characterized core sequence f the subgenomic                           promoter, and the deletion analysis of BMV genomic RNA3                         provide strong circumstantial evidence that these sequenced                     function as promoters of (+) strand replication.  The Pi has                    used wild type and mutant transcripts in combination with                       unique in vitro replication procedures to define the                            promoters of genomic (-) strand synthesis and subgenomic (+)                    strand synthesis.  However, the promoters of (+) strand                         genomic RNA synthesis are as yet undefined.  In vivo viral                      RNA synthesis is usually highly asymmetric with many times                      more (+) strand RNA being synthesized than (-) strand.n  tRNA                   gene transcription in eukaryotes, dependent on polymerase III                   and associated transcription factors, is a nuclear process.                     The apparent homology to promoters of tRNAs suggests                            involvement of host factors in viral (+) strand synthesis,                      possibly pol III transcription factors are proposed.                            Experiments are to define which elements within and                             surrounding the ICRs of BMV are essential and functional in                     replication.  Furthermore, the role of the ICRs in the                          asymmetry of replication, and in determining the specific                       molar ratios of genomic RNAs synthesized is addressed.                          Identification of the host factor(s) involved in replication                    is essential in that they are the core of the host-pathogen                     relationship.",
