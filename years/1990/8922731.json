Platz, Ohio State University and Dr. Sol                         Celebi Dokuz Eylul University of Izmir, Turkey.  The                            proposal funding is to support the travel of Dr. Celibi to                      Ohio State Universityand her per diem expenses there during                     a ten month period for her research in synthesizing various                     chemical substances (diazines) and to study their                               photochemistry using the most recent developments in                            spectroscopic and photochemical techniques.  This research                      will be conducted in conjunction with an NSF supported                          research effort directed by Dr. Platz entitled \"Kinetics,                       Spectroscopy and Mechanistic Studies of Carbenes, Biradicals                    and Radicals.\"  Dr. Celebi's research will be an                                international extension of Dr. Platz's research at Ohio                         State.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This proposal will be bring a Turkish scientist                         experienced in the university classroom and in Turkey's                         research laboratories to Ohio State University to conduct                       research in reactive intermediate chemistry under the                           guidance and direction of one of the young leading                              scientists in his field of study.  The research experience                      gained and the acquired scientific knowledge are all                            transferable to the university classrooms and research                          laboratories of her university, the Dokoz Eylul University.                     These two goals are the real motivating ideas behind this                       proposal--the international exchange of scientific knowledge                    and the contribution to the scientific capabilities of a                        developing country--Turkey.  By reason of these goals, it is                    considered that this proposal meets the objectives of the                       Science in Developing Countries Program.",
