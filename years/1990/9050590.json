 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enhances the computer science curriculum through the               introduction of an undergraduate concentration in parallel computing.           The purchase of parallel processing hardware permits the implementation         of laboratory experiences in the parallel computing courses, enables            larger seminar projects and facilitates independent study.  The key             equipment consists of a 64 processor, parallel machine, a PARACOM               Multicluster, based on the INMOS T800 Transputer.  The 64 nodes of this         system can be partitioned into sub-clusters and allocated to as many as         4 different users, simultaneously.  Each user is able to request                allocation and to configure it by selecting a wide range of connection          topologies.  The system can also be treated as a single 64 processor            supercomputer.  All of these options are under software control, and            the Multicluster is accessible from the existing undergraduate network          of Sun Microsystems workstations.  The equipment can be expanded as the         demand for parallel processing grows.                                                                                                                           The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
