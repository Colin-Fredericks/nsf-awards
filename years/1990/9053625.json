 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) is a                      progressive science and technology center.  Its philosophy                      toward science education is to make it enticing, enjoyable and                  motivating.  It accomplishes this by means of \"hands-on\",                       interactive exhibits and programs designed to provide a non-                    threatening learning environment, for which we are recognized                   nationally.                                                                                                                                                          OMSI recognizes the important national need to assist the                  public in understanding and being comfortable with advances in,                 and methodology of applied science.  It proposes to design and                  build a large exhibit that promotes problem solving using                       engineering principles.                                                                                                                                              The exhibit will pose problems, offer basic information                    for the solution and provide a variety of tools and building                    materials from which the visitor can choose.  The visitor then                  devises one or several possible solutions, and constructs a                     prototype to be tested in one of three large scale testing                      laboratories.  The engineering fields addressed are                             aeronautical, mechanical and civil.                                                                                                                                  Our visitors will come away from the exhibit with an                       increased appreciation for the way engineering is done and how                  solutions affect their lives.                                                                                                                                        OMSI is requesting $577,324 from the National Science                      Foundation as well as $427,539 from the Port of Portland to                     design and build this exhibit.  The Port of Portland is                         interested in demonstrating how its commercial activities                       relate to engineering.                                                                                                                                               OMSI plans to disseminate information about the exhibit to                 educators and other museums on a national level.",
