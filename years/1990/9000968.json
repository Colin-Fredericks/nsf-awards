 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although this mathematical research concerns theory on                     smoothly bounded domains in the space of several complex                        variables, the focus is on studying the behavior of solutions of                first- and second-order partial differential equations.  The main               theme is to determine function classes determined by projecting                 functions onto the spaces of solutions of the differential                      equations.  Specifically, one would like to know if functions in                the classical Lebesgue classes, or those which are Holder                       continuous project onto functions of the same type.  The answer                 depends on the smoothness of the boundary and, possibly, on the                 dimension of the ambient space.  In the case of strongly pseudo-                convex domains, results are quite complete.  For weakly pseudo-                 convex domains of finite type in two complex dimensions, the same               can be said.  This is the current dividing line.                                     The work to be done in this project first will take up the                 regularity question for the Lebesgue spaces for powers less than                one.  A concrete approach will be made by focusing on the                       specific case where the domain is the Siegel upper half plane.                  In this setting the powerful machinery of harmonic analysis can                 be brought to bear using existing theory of Hardy spaces.                            A second line of investigation will center on studies of the               regularity of the Szego kernel (projection) in two complex                      dimensions for domains with a boundary point of infinite type.                  These types of boundaries have a resistance to dilation - at                    present the only technique available to prove regularity.  Some                 progress has been made here in showing that the first few terms                 of the Szego kernel can actually be computed.",
