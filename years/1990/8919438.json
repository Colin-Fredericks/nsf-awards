 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the brain is the principal organ that produces                          behavior, one of the goals of neuroscience is to determine what                 structural specializations of the brain are involved in                         specific behavior.  Comparisons of brain structure in diverse                   animals with similar or different behavior is one of the                        approaches of comparative neurobiology.  Such studies can lead                  to new insights about brain form and function by revealing                      important differences from the patterns found in typical                        laboratory animals.  This work will provide important detailed                  histological sections of brains from the Florida manatee, or                    sea cow.  This large aquatic mammal, despite its appearance, is                 related to the elephants, has several unusual brain                             specializations, and is an endangered species.  The brains for                  this work have come from animals mortally injured, chiefly by                   boating accidents, obtained by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife                         Service.  The brain sections will be incorporated into an                       existing archival collection of the highest quality of                          mammalian brains, now containing examples of more than 100                      species representing 17 different taxonomic orders.  This                       collection facilitates quantitative, comparative analysis of                    particular brain regions in animals with known behavior.  These                 tissues will be extremely valuable not only to neuroanatomists                  and neurobiologists, but also to systematists and zoologists.",
