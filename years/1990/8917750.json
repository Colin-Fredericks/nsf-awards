 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nature of the shallow oceanic crust produced at seafloor                    spreading centers is poorly constrained by available geophysical                data. Recent studies suggest that the shallowest layers of the                  crust are characterized by extremely low seismic velocities, but                that the velocity increases rapidly with depth. Understanding the               processes that control these variations are important in                        determining the porosity of the crust, alteration of crustal                    rock, and the local and regional significance of crustal drilling               data.                                                                                                                                                           The present award will support a near bottom refraction study of                a segment of the East Pacific Rise in the eastern equatorial                    Pacific. The project will allow a detailed study of the shallow                 crust by using both a receiver and acoustic source deployed at                  the seafloor. This technique will provide a higher resolution                   study than is available from normal surface ship observations.                  Data from the experiment will be compared to drilling results                   which are planned along this same section of ridge. The principal               investigators on this project have distinguished records in both                experimental and theoretical analysis of crustal data.",
