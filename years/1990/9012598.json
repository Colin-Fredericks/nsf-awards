 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last ten years have witnessed a significant restructuring in                much of the American corporate sector, with the economic value of               merger and acquisition activity totalling nearly $180 billion for               both 1985 and 1986. The magnitude of these activities has                       attracted considerable attention and the empirical evidence                     clearly indicates that the shareholders of target firms benefit                 substantially from successful takeovers, with virtually no gains                for the shareholders of acquiring firms. An important aspect of                 this phenomenon is the source of these gains. Specifically are                  these the synergistic gains of economic efficiency or do they                   represent at least in part a redistribution of firm value from                  organizational stakeholders to shareholders? This study provides                a direct test of the hypothesis that some of these shareholder                  gains come at the expense of unionized labor. Given prior work                  establishing that union wage and benefit premia come at the                     expense of shareholders, a change in corporate control is one                   more issue that enters the relationship between labor and                       management over the distribution of firm value. The first part of               the study will test the hypothesis about the distribution of                    shareholder gains based on the merger and acquisition experience                of 468 publicly traded firms from 1982-86. A unique unionization                database is developed at the firm level based on information                    available from the U.S. Treasury/ Department of Labor. The second               part of the project will include a case study of 5 - 10 firms in                the sample.",
