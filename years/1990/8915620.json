 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Arthur Winfree is supported by a grant from the                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      theoretical and experimental studies on excitable media.                        Excitable media are chemical systems which respond dramatically                 to a stimulus that exceeds some threshold.  These studies have                  a far reaching impact on such diverse applications as:                          transmission of nerve impulses, heart muscle contraction                        including lethal arrhythmias, and burn stability in solid-fuel                  rockets.                                                                                                                                                        In the laboratory and in supercomputers Winfree studies wave                    geometry in excitable media whose equations are well enough                     known to permit critical comparison between laboratory                          measurements and computer simulations.  In particular he                        studies the self-organizing behavior of such 3-dimensional                      media which resembles vortex ring formation in fluids.  In                      theory, these organizing centers exist in a variety of                          topologically distinct forms, some of which may be dynamically                  stable for certain characteristic sizes.  The well-known                        Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction has been used as a                       synthetic model system to experimentally confirm numerically                    simulated results.",
