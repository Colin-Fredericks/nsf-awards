 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory course, \"Properties of Engineering Materials,\"  has                been developed for mechanical engineers.  The goals of the new                  course are:                                                                     (1) To show the effects of structure and mechanical processing on                   material properties,                                                        (2) To show the differences between the behavior of metals,                         polymers and composites,                                                    (3) To become familiar with standard experimental techniques, and               (4) To show the importance of these effects and differences in                      design and manufacturing.                                                        The equipment required for this project includes an impact                 machine and a computer controlled tensile machine suitable for                  testing ductile polymers and elastomers.  These make possible                   the study of new polymer and composite materials, especially the                internal damping and creep behavior that occurs at room                         temperature.  Also the effects of material processing on mechanical             properties can be investigated.  The award is being matched by an               equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
