 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists in           a joint seminar on \"Dynamical Excitation by Exotic and Highly Charged           Ions,\" to be held in Anchorage, Alaska, June 18-22, 1990.  The                  seminar will focus on topics of mutual interest to leading American             and Japanese experts in the field of fundamental processes in the               physics of ions.  Recent advances in the field, such as the                     development of low energy antiproton beams, the higher energies of              the accelerator facilities available for atomic collision                       experimentation, the imminent availability of storage rings, and                other developments, make this a propitious time for a joint seminar.            The central objective of the program will be to identify the                    limitations of our current understanding of fundamental processes in            the physics of exotic and highly charged ions and to delineate new              ways in which particle accelerators can be used to advance science in           this area.  The co-organizers of the seminar are Professor John F.              Reading, Department of Physics, Texas A & M University, and Professor           Fuminori Fujimoto, The Institute of Scientific and Industrial                   Research, Osaka University, Japan.  Two previous U.S.-Japan seminars            in this field were very successful in exploring topics of mutual                interest to participants from both countries, in defining new                   research directions, and in promoting joint research efforts.  This             seminar has similar goals.                                                                                                                                      The physics of atomic collisions plays an important role in                     determining the behavior of matter at the atomic and molecular level.           Research in atomic and molecular collision phenomena, therefore, can            have an important influence not only on various areas of physics,               such as plasma physics, surface physics, condensed matter physics,              and astrophysics, but also on other disciplines and technologies such           as weather forecasting and forensic medicine.  Researchers in both              the United States and Japan are very active in this field, and                  leaders from both countries will participate in the seminar.  It is             planned to publish the proceedings of the seminar in a special issue            of Nuclear Instruments and Methods.",
