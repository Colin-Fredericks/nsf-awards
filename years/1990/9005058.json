 "awd_abstract_narration": "The extensive 1988 Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) fires constitute              a landscape disturbance of rare magnitude, and one with important               ecological, geomorphic, and climatic implications.  In order to                 provide a longer-term perspective on this event, we propose to                  investigate the history of Holocene sedimentation in northeastern               Yellowstone, using actualistic study of modern fire-related and                 prefire sedimentation as a guide for interpretation of the                      stratigraphic record.  A detailed, highly datable record of                     Holocene fire-related sedimentation events is preserved in alluvial             and colluvial deposits of the Soda Butte Creek drainage.  Initial               radiocarbon dating of these events suggests a link with times of                Holocene climatic change.  Comparison of the timing of fire-related             events with paleobotanical and climate proxy records can elucidate              the relative importance of changing vegetation and hydrological                 regime, wildfire effects, and intrinsic thresholds in this                      geomorphic system.  We will also examine historical records of                  meteorological and regional atmospheric conditions associated with              both extensive fires and large hydrological events in the GYA, and              attempt to develop analogs for climate associated with fire-related             sedimentation.  This research will help to assess the short-term                geomorphic response to the 1988 GYA fires, as well as indicate                  possible consequences of potential global warming and climatic                  change for landscape stability in the GYA ecosystem.",
