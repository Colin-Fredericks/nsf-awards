 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern laboratory investigations in petrography, the study                 of the mineralogy and textures of rocks, go far beyond                          traditional methods of transmitted light microscopy.  We are                    requesting an optical microscopy system to bring new equipment                  and techniques into our undergraduate curriculum.  The equipment                includes a polarizing microscope with both transmitted and                      reflected light systems to display all three types of images.                   Cathode luminescence is sensitive to specific trace elements  in                minerals;  it highlights subtle textures produced by sequential                 crystal growth that are not visible in transmitted light, and                   permits rapid identification of certain minerals.  Reflected                    light allows identification of opaque minerals and study of their               intergrowths.  With the video system we can dramatically increase               efficiency and clarity in instruction of petrographic methods:                  we will all be looking at the same feature at the same time.  The               alternative is painstaking interaction with each student, taking                turns viewing an image in the scope.  The students will use the                 instruments in a series of new classroom exercises and in                       undergraduate research.  The video display also allows                          instructive demonstrations in introductory classes to show the                  importance of synthesizing several types of information.",
