 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on performance issues in rule-based                       knowledge bases that have to manage large amounts of rules and                  data. An effective implementation of such systems, particularly                 if they are distributed, has proven to be a major stumbling block               in the way of their efficient performance. In this project,                     parallel processing for solving the performance problem is                      investigated. The goals of the research are: (1) to establish a                 theory of parallel and distributed rule processing; and (2) based               on the theory, to devise processing strategies and criteria for                 comparing them, so that an optimal strategy can be selected for a               given rule-based program, data structures, and a                                parallel/distributed architecture. The results of the research                  will be experimentally evaluated in Net-mate, a system for                      management of very large communication networks (hundreds of                    thousands of interconnected computers), that is currently under                 development at Columbia University.  An important issue in                      network management is automatic detection of fault conditions.                  Rule-based programming is ideal for this purpose, but it requires               the analysis of very large amounts of statistical and                           configuration data that is distributed, leading to the type of                  performance problems that this research aims to solve. Hence, the               Net-mate system is an ideal testbed for this research, and both                 projects are expected to benefit from the cooperation and provide               results applicable to distributed and parallel computing.",
