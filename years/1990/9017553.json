 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are three variations of the maple sugaring process, all              of which return to the use of the basic open pan system. This                   system has been returned to repeatedly throughout history. However,             this system has not proved to be energy efficient and/or sanitary               and it is extremely time consuming.                                             %%%                                                                                  The objective of the proposed research is to modernize the                 present Maple Syrup process. The goal of the proposed system is to              become energy efficient. The impact of this system will overtake                the sugaring industry; the cost of producing Maple Syrup would                  drastically be reduced. Through preliminary calculations the cost               per gallon of Maple Syrup would be 55 percent less than the present             day costs.",
