 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Delmarva Peninsula is a particularly appropriate location for               a research program in Environmental and Quaternary Geophysics.                  The rise and fall of sea level during the Quaternary is                         abundantly evidenced in this area by relict strandlines and                     barrier-spit deposits from previous relative sea-level maxima and               buried paleochannels of the Susquehanna and Delaware river                      systems from several relative sea-level minima.  These features                 have been identified and mapped offshore and in the Chesapeake                  and Delaware Bays using marine seismic data.  The continuation                  and geometry of these features on land can be estimated from well               data where available but high-resolution seismic reflection data                on land is required to accurately map them and to characterize                  their boundaries and internal structure in detail.  The mapping                 and stratigraphic positioning of these features allow us to                     better reconstruct climatic change in the Quaternary and to                     understand the impact of sea-level rise or fall on coastal                      features.  The paleochannels hold an additional interest                        environmentally, in that the coarse materials within the channels               may act as preferred pathways for the transport of fluid media,                 including fluid contaminants.",
