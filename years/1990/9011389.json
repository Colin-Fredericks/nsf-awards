 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop representations and algorithms for               generating assembly sequences of products.  The problem is                      theoretically of combinatorial complexity.                                           A method has been developed to describe axially symmatic                   developed to describe assemblies based upon high-level engineering              features and mating conditions. A rule-based algorithm derives a                graph-structure corresponding to an exploded-view of the assembly.              Interpreting this information as precedences among components,                  another program generates selected assembly sequences.                               This research will extend the methodology to general, three-               dimensional cases.  The importance of this research is twofold;                 automatically providing the designer with information regarding the             assembly process can significantly enhance the simultaneous                     engineering process; and by showing that computerized spatial                   reasoning is possible with high-level input descriptions,                       powerful design assistants can be developed for                                 computer aided design systems.",
