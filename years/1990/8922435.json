 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within contemporary philosophy of mathematics, \"classicism\"                     in mathematics is understood as standard mathematical practice                  as characterized by classical logical reasoning.  This                          practice is usually associated with a \"platonist\"                               philosophical standpoint according to which axioms and                          theorems are viewed to be objective truths about a mind-                        independent mathematical reality consisting of abstract                         objects of the sort mathematical discourse appears to quantify                  over.  \"Constructivism,\" on the other hand, covers those                        minority schools who reject as illegitimate central components                  of classical practice and seek to develop alternative practice                  based on constructivist principles.  The particular                             constructivist schools under examination in this project                        reject as illegitimate the classical conception of objective                    mathematical truth on which classical logic is based and they                   reject the ordinary notion of \"existence\" in context of                         mathematics.  In its place, they substitute principles of                       constructive object and constructive proof.                                                                                                                     In this project, Professor Hellman is examining the                             longstanding opposition between classical mathematical                          practice and leading constructivist schools, emphasizing the                    importance of scientific applications of mathematics.   At the                  outset, he is examining the philosophical underpinnings of the                  constructivist challenge in light of recent \"modal-structural                   interpretations,\"  supporting classicism but avoiding certain                   problems of standard platonism. He is then examining arguments                  that abstract mathematics is \"indispensable\" for science and                    assessing the scope and force of these arguments, especially                    in light of recent mathematical-logical work (predicative                       reductions, reverse mathematics) which seems severely to limit                  the impact of such arguments.  Finally he is bringing to bear                   such arguments on the classicism-constructivism controversy.                    The viability of constructivism for scientific purposes is                      being assessed in light of recently uncovered obstacles to its                  applicability, both generally, in circumstances of empirical                    uncertainty, and specially, in the domain of quantum physics.",
