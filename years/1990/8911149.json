 "awd_abstract_narration": "While scientific theories are debated on a seemingly abstract,                  academic plane in the leading developed countries of the world,                 developing countries have long been interested in new scientific                developments in order to apply them for their own purposes.  Yet                little is known about the interest in, development and impact of                new scientific theories in developing societies.  Professor Glick               is looking at one aspect of this phenomenon.  Specifically, under               this grant, he is undertaking a comparative study of the first                  phase of the reception of Mendelian genetics in Uruguay,                        Argentina and Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul).  In all three                         countries, early genetics was introduced by biologists working in               schools of agronomy or in agricultural experiment stations.  Of                 particular interest is the relationship between early genetics                  and the improvement of herds of \"creole\" cattle--a matter of                    debate since the 1860s and one which, in Uruguay, had been waged                between partisans of \"crossing\" and selection, in the context of                the contemporary polemic of Darwinism.  The fact that genetics                  was introduced there by German agronomists ensured that the                     discussion of breeding continued in an evolutionary framework.                  In this research, Professor Glick seeking to determine just how                 much early genetics was tailored to the demands of the breeders                 in Argentina and Rio Grande do Sul, two other areas where cattle                breeders were a predominant economic interest group and where                   debates over creole cattle had taken place.  Professor Glick is                 studying not only the political relationship between breeders and               genetics but also the extent to which breeders themselves kept                  abreast of changing scientific ideas.",
