 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethics and Values Studies at the National Science Foundation                    supports research and educational projects on ethical and value                 aspects of the interaction between science, technology and society.             It is appropriate, therefore, for EVS to support projects that                  explore the preparation of scientists to recognize and evaluate                 value-laden elements in scientific practice and uses of science.                Directed at basic cognitive and educational processes, this                     empirical research explores (1) the current state of undergraduate              values education across science and non-science disciplines; (2)                the extent to which values analysis skills are content or domain                specific; and (3) ways of enhancing the usefulness of values                    education to science students.  This study is the second phase of               an ongoing research project.  Responses to questionnaires                       administered in Stage 1 indicated that mathematics and science                  faculty were less inclined than humanities faculty to feel that                 values issues should be treated in their courses; student responses             from both humanities and science majors indicated the belief that               there was a significant discrepancy between the extent to which                 values education should occur and did occur in their major courses.             Humanities majors reported more preparation to handle values-                   related issues than did science majors.  The second stage extends               the research in two ways:  (1)  More specific information will be               sought in an effort to determine the particular aspects of faculty,             courses, and teaching methods which are associated with effective               values education, and (2)  Techniques for the assessment of                     students' values analysis skills will be developed, to provide more             direct evaluation of student outcomes.  Assessment of these                     abilities will allow the research to explore whether, and in what               ways, the values analysis skills of humanities and science students             differ, and whether values skills learned in humanities courses                 transfer to science issues (and vice versa) or whether values                   abilities are content specific.  Results of this research will be               made available to a scholarly audience of scientists and educators              by publication in professional journals.  In addition, knowledge                gained from this project will be disseminated to a broader audience             by inclusionin a book on values education in the liberal arts                   college.  Plans for the book, authored by an interdisciplinary                  group of faculty, are in progress in consultation with an                       interested publisher.                                                                                                                                           This project addresses a need which has been described by                       educators, administrators, and public policymakers.  The                        investigators are well qualified; the sponsoring institution                    provides an appropriate venue for the research; research plans are              appropriate; and results will be of interest to a broad audience.               An award in the amount of $25,087 is therefore recommended.",
