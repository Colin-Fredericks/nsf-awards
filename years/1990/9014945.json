 "awd_abstract_narration": "The binding of polyelectrolytes to oppositely charged colloids                  and surfaces is important in biological phenomena and in                        environmental processes.  The binding energetics are controlled                 by the colloid surface charge density, the effective charge of                  the polyion binding sequence, and the Debye screening length.                   The structure of the resultant complexes or aggregates depends,                 in addition, on the dimensions of the colloidal particle, the                   chain length of the polyion, and the concentrations of these two                species.  This work describes polyelectrolyte - nonionic/ionic                  micelle systems as a paradigm for the investigation of these                    effects.  Interaction energetics will be explored by establishing               the interrelationship among various parameters at critical                      binding conditions.  The structure of soluble polyion-micelle                   complexes will be explored using static and dynamic light                       scattering, as a function of the dimensions of the two macroionic               species.  Of special interest is the transition from intrapolymer               micelle binding, to polymer bridging of micelles, as the size of                the micelle increases relative to that of the polyion.                          Phenomenological relationships developed will be compared to                    current theoretical treatments, and their general utility will be               evaluated for other charged colloids, e.g. silica.",
