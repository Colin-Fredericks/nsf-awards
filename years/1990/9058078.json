 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this PYI-directed research program will be on                      colloidal particles and the focus associated with their                         transport.                                                                      One force of fundamental interest is electrokinetic lift,                       which arises from the relative motion of charged bodies in                      electrolyte solutions.  Electrokinetic lift is significant to                   all particle transport processes including hydrodynamic                         chromatography, deep-bed filtration, suspension rheology, and                   the detachment of particles from surfaces during fluid flow.                    Given the broad applicability of this force, it is essential                    that one assesses the importance of electrokinetic lift in a                    given system.  Previous analyses of this force have focused on                  two bodies bearing thin, equilibrium double layers.  Such                       simplified models, while easy to theoretically characterize,                    are not technologically relevant.  For example, the analyses                    have shown that electrokinetic lift is more important in                        nonaqueous media, which are characterized by thick,                             nonequilibrium double layers.  The PI will initiate an in-                      depth analysis of this force, removing first the equilibrium                    double-layer restriction and, second, the thin double-layer                     restriction.  These theoretical studies will be coupled with                    experimental observation of lift.  Later, transport studies                     will then be extended to focus on the role of colloidal forces                  in the rheology of dispersions with application to coatings                     and films.  The results of this work will greatly enrich the                    fundamental understanding of the transport of colloidal                         particles.",
