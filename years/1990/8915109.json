 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for the February 1990                       Gordon Conference on organic thin films.  The chairperson is                    Joel M. Schnur of the Naval Research Laboratories in                            Washington, D.C.  The conference will focus on the fundamental                  aspects of organic thin films from a molecular point of view.                   The relationship between the molecular structure of the films                   and the macroscopic properties exhibited by them such as                        wetting, adhesion, and lubrication will be examined.  The                       ability to molecularly engineer films for potential                             applications will be explored.  Application topics include                      biosensor fabrication, advances in sub-micron                                   microlithographic resists, and non-linear optical thin films.                   State of the art techniques such as atomic force and ion                        conductance microscopies will be examined in the context of                     their utility for the study of organic thin films.  The                         conference will bring together chemical, material, and                          electronic engineers, biologists, physicists, and chemists.                                                                                                     This conference indirectly supports the major thrust of the                     Chemical and Thermal System's Material Chemistry and Chemical                   Processing initiative.  Approximately 125 attendees are                         expected.  The NSF support enables participation of young                       investigators, such as graduate students, as well as faculty                    with inadequate resources to attend.  Under-represented groups                  will also be targeted for support.  Three international                         experts will be invited to participate from Japan and Western                   Europe.",
