Over 100 earth dams were located within a                                       distance of approximately 100 km from the                                       source of this earthquake.  The aim of this                                     project is to evaluate in detail two earth                                      dams that were significantly instrumented and                                   in which the instruments were triggered                                         during the earthquake.  In addition, and to                                     the extent available, the recordings from                                       other dams, together with other information                                     about these dams, are also being collected                                      and will be made available in a single                                          document that can be utilized by other users.                                                                                                                   The two dams are the San Justo Dam, 150 ft                                      high, and the San Luis Dam, which is 300 ft                                     high.  These dams are respectively about 40                                     km and 80 km from the zone of energy release.                                   Soil and geologic data are available for both                                   dams.  Detailed one- and two-dimensional                                        analyses are being conducted in order to                                        assess the dynamic shear-strain                                                 characteristics of the material comprising                                      each dam-foundation system and to examine the                                   adequacy of various available analytical                                        procedures for calculating the response of                                      earth dams during earthquakes.                                                                                                                                  This is the first time that such detailed                                       analyses can be conducted with measured                                         earthquake response records at several                                          locations of an earth dam.",
