 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of technology for casting and               polishing 8m telescope mirrors.  At this size, considerations of                stiffness, weight and thermal response strongly favor honeycomb                 sandwich design for the mirror blank.  Over the past few years a                casting technique has been developed at the University of Arizona               in which glass is melted into a complex mold to form a honeycomb                sandwich structure in one piece.  Two 3.5m blanks have already                  been cast.  In the funding period the casting furnace will be                   enlarged, and the first castings made at the 6.5m and 8m size.                                                                                                  The project is also concerned with the development of the                       stressed lap method of mirror polishing.  This is a                             straightforward and direct attack on the problem of polishing                   highly aspheric surfaces with reasonable speed.  The lap's shape                is changed as it moves across the mirror, to match the varying                  shape of the surface under it. The method is important especially               for the largest telescopes, which benefit in stability and                      economy if the primary has a short focal length, and is thus                    strongly asperic.  Speed of polishing is also critical for                      economical production of very large surfaces.                                                                                                                   Both the technologies being developed can be expected to find                   application to large optics in general, not just in astronomy.",
