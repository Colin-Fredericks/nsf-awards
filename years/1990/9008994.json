 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study attempts to understand the evolution of organized               religion in America by focusing on the life-histories of                        mainstream Protestant denominations over nearly a century.  In                  particular, it analyzes the determinants of schisms, by which                   most new denominations have come into existence, and the demise                 of existing denominations through merger.  The more conventional                approach focuses on doctrinal disputes as the major determinant                 of denominational boundaries.  By contrast, this study follows                  Weber, Troeltsch, and Niebuhr in treating doctrinal disputes as                 reflections of larger debates about the relationship between                    denominations and the wider social order, and about the nature of               authority within religious communities.  Schism and merger are                  treated as organizational processes.  Drawing on life-histories                 of 175 mainstream Protestant denominations between 1890 and 1980,               the empirical analysis will be conducted in two parallel phases.                First, they plan to collect detailed qualitative data from                      archival sources on subsets of denominations that have                          experienced schisms and mergers.  The goal is to understand the                 internal processes by which disputes become codified into                       ideologies that set the terms for insurgency and coalition-                     building.  In the second phase, they will use longitudinal data                 from the entire sample of denominations to test hypotheses about                the propensity to schism and merger.  They will draw on                         organizational theory to develop three kinds of models:                         structural models that emphasize the internal characteristics of                denominations; ecological models that emphasize competition for                 organizational resources; and institutional models that emphasize               shifts in the normative structure of society.  The potential                    contribution of the study to organizational theory arises from                  its attention to rates, types, and processes of birth and death.                By synthesizing micro- and macro-level analyses, this study                     promises to yield a comprehensive understanding of the process of               denominational reorganization in America.",
