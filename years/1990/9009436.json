 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the unique properties of liquid                  crystals (LCs) as membrane barriers for electrical field-                       enhanced separation of fluid mixtures.  Such materials are                      organic molecules which form partially ordered phases.                          Application of an electric field to the LC can influences                       spatial order within the crystal, the most dramatic effect                      being a variety of electrohydrodynamic (EHD) instabilities and                  anisotropy.  In the presence of an electron this anisotropy                     produces current focus and space charge accumulation, which in                  turn leads to electric body forces and flow of the LC.  With                    appropriate parameter selection this flow can enhance the                       charge accumulator, a form of positive feedback, thus                           producing the instability.  Moreover, the result with a                         dynamic AC field is a series of bifurcations to chaotic                         turbulent flow as sub-micron dimensions.                                                                                                                        The EHD induced instability can be used to make structures                      exhibiting voltage controlled permeability.  Permeation across                  the membrane barrier occurs by diffuse flux which when                          subjected to the electric force produces a large controllable                   increase in the permeability of the LC layer.  For mixtures                     with different solubilities, the high permeability EHD state                    can become an effective and selective membrane for separation                   processes.  In addition, because of the enhanced transport                      induced across the barrier, the technique can be used as a                      \"permeability switch\" for providing a rapid, clean signal to a                  sensing element for on-demand sampling and analysis of process                  streams.",
