 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative materials research in the                       applied physics of semiconductors to be conducted by William                    Paul of Harvard University and Ivan Chambouleyron of the                        University of Campinas in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil.                       This work will involve a study of the fundamental properties                    of amorphous hydrogenated germanium, especially those important                 for photoelectronic applications.  While a similar material,                    amorphous hydrogenated silicon is the usual material used for                   thin film solar cells and field-effect transistors, this                        research will seek more fundamental understanding of non-                       crystalline semiconductors made of hydrogenated silicon-                        germanium alloys and unalloyed amorphous hydrogenated                           germanium.                                                                                                                                                      This work will combine the efforts of two laboratories, each                    of which has special facilities.  They will exchange samples,                   apply new research techniques and collaborate in the analysis                   of results to arrive at improved theories for the germanium                     materials and the alloys.  Specific facilities at Harvard                       include glow discharge, photo-chemical vapor deposition and                     sputtering: those at Campinas, sputtering and reactive                          evaporation.  Campinas has Mossbauer spectroscopy available                     while Harvard has special facilities for differential                           scanning calorimetry, gas evolution and time of flight                          measurements.  Clearly, the facilities, experience and                          expertise of these two groups will complement each other and                    the collaboration will advance the scientific and device                        parameters of amorphous semiconductors.",
