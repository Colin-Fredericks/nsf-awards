 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamic interaction of an enzyme (E) with its substrate(S)                  occurs along a well-defined catalytic pathway that consists of                  multiple, elementary steps.  As this pathway is traversed,                      transient enzyme-substrate intermediates, ESi are formed.  In                   order to fully understand the mechanism of enzyme catalysis, it                 is essential that these.  ES1 be detected and that their relative               energies, rates of interconversion and structures be determined.                Such studies are inherently difficult because of the brief                      lifetime and low concentration of such species.  In the proposed                research, a new low temperature stopped- flow instrument will be                constructed and stopped-flow cryoenzymology will be used to study               the pathway for the hydrolysis of dansyl-peptide substrates by                  thermolysin.  The use of subzero temperatures and cryosolvents                  will slow down the rate of interconversion of ESi along the                     pathway.  Radiationless energy transfer between tryptophan                      residues of the enzyme of the enzyme and the dansyl group of the                substrate will be used to visualize the ESi.  The rate constants                and activation energies for each elementary step in the reaction                will be determined.  Thermolysin is a zinc proteinase that                      retains activity when Co(II), Mn(II) and Fe(II) are substituted                 at the active site,and studies will be carried out with all four                species to investigate the role of the metal ion in each step.  A               new rapid scan diode array detector will be constructed and rapid               scan optical studies will be carried out with Co(II)-thermolysin                to characterize the structure of the metal center in each ESi.",
