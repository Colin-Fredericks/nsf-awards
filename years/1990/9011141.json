We are most interested                                    in determining how much, if any, the value of                                   unreinforced residential properties has                                         declined as a result of:  1) the earthquake,                                    2) anticipated revisions to the region's                                        building codes and 3) public notification that                                  a structure is seismically unsafe (as required                                  in Palo Alto).                                                                                                                                                  A variation of the hedonic pricing model will                                   be used to measure the Bay Area's willingness                                   to pay for seismic safety.  Repeat sales data                                   obtained from the Society of Real Estate                                        Appraisers will be analyzed to isolate the                                      effects of risks and regulations on market                                      values.                                                                                                                                                         The results will show:  1) the effects of                                       soils and structural deficiencies on property                                   values; 2) whether the costs of improving                                       seismic safety can be recouped by the property                                  owner; 3) the likelihood that property owners                                   would abandon or convert rental properties                                      rather than comply with the revised code; and                                   4) the extent to which policies designed to                                     induce voluntary compliance, such as those in                                   place in Palo Alto, have produced the                                           appropriate market signals.",
