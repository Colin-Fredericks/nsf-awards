 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on three areas of mathematical                     analysis: (1) periods of hyperelliptic Riemann surfaces and                     Hamiltonian mechanics, (2) matrix problems, and (3) long-time                   behavior of integrable systems.  The first topic involves the                   investigation of a new connection between the arithmetic-                       geometric mean and the computation of hyperelliptic integrals on                the one hand, and Hamiltonian mechanics on the other.  The second               topic involves the analysis of high accuracy algorithms to                      compute the singular values of a matrix.  This part of the                      project is also concerned with the problem of computing the                     eigenvalues and eigenvectors of products of matrices.  A central                role in the analysis is played by integrable Hamiltonian systems                which interpolate the iterates of the singular value /                          eigenvalue algorithms at integer times.  The third topic involves               an analysis of the long-time behavior of integrable systems,                    specifically of the Toda shock problem.  Attention will be                      focused on the case of low shock speed, the more general case for               higher shock speeds, the stability problem in which a doubly                    infinite Toda lattice in equilibrium is perturbed locally, the                  question of the rate and the manner in which the eigenvalues fill               the \"phantom\" band, and the analysis of the long-time behavior of               the nonlinear wave equations in the Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy.                        The work in this project deals with spectral problems and                  inverse spectral problems.  The project is concerned with                       applications to Hamiltonian mechanics, with the development of                  algorithms which improve the accuracy of the computed singular                  values of a matrix, and with the study of the long-time behavior                of integrable systems.",
