 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year program is to conduct a summer inservice                          institutes for 50 secondary biology teachers from Central                       Kansas and surrounding area to provide them with:  l) more                      adequate conceptions of the nature of science and scientific                    theories; 2) enhanced science content from the biological and                   geological perspectives; 3) alternatives for assessing and                      addressing student misconceptions regarding evolutionary                        theory; and 4) a rationale for and opportunities to integrate                   the nature of science, enhanced content, alternative                            instructional strategies, and the assessment/confrontation of                   student misconceptions about evolution into their biology                       curriculum, instructional units and lessons.  The institutes                    are proposed for high school biology teachers primarily from                    rural/small schools, many of whom often represent a school                      district as a science department unto themselves.  Follow-up                    sessions will be conducted at each participant's school                         district during the academic year to assess individual                          teacher progress and potential individual concerns.  In                         addition, the second-year institute will establish a cadre of                   experienced \"master\" teachers capable of promoting                              opportunities among their students to participate in learning                   experiences which simulate the processes by which scientists                    examine the natural world, establish criteria by which to                       judge scientific from non-scientific beliefs.  Finally, the                     second-year institute will enable these \"master\" teachers to                    share/model successful alternative approaches for the                           teaching of biology for another group of less experienced                       science (biology) teachers in their home school districts.                                                                                                      An amount equivalent to 60.7% of the NSF contribution is                        provided by Kansas State University as cost-sharing.",
