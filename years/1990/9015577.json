 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports continued research into programming language                support for parallel scientific computation on (MIMD) distributed               memory multiprocessors.  It is becoming clear that this class of                parallel computers will play an important role in the future of                 large scale scientific computation.  Currently, however, such                   computers are very difficult to program.  The goal of this research             is to make it considerably easier and more natural to program these             computers for large scale parallel scientific computation, without              sacrificing the run-time efficiency of the resultant code.  A second            goal is to make such programs portable between different distributed            memory multiprocessors.  The main issues are high-level language                support for parallel numerical algorithms that use dynamic data and             process structures.  The researchers will interact extensively with             scientists who are (potential) users of these computers.  This                  interaction is aimed at increasing understanding of the paradigms               that underline the scientists' parallel algorithms, integrating these           paradigms into programming language research, and assessing how well            this research is meeting their needs.//",
