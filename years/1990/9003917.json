 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unicellular algae, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, have the                capacity to concentrate CO2 internally, allowing these organisms                to grow photoautotrophically at CO2 concentrations lower than                   most higher plants can tolerate.  This CO2 concentrating                        mechanism is inducible; it is present only in cells that have                   been grown with limiting CO2 conditions.  An important aspect of                this Ci (Ci = CO2 + HCO3- + CO3-2) accumulation system is located               in the chloroplast.  Intact chloroplasts isolated from low CO2-                 grown C. reinhardtii cells retain the ability to accumulate Ci to               much higher levels than intact chloroplasts isolated from high                  Co2-grown cells.  Five polypeptides that are specifically induced               by growth on low CO2 and are missing in the high CO2-requiring                  strain CIA-5 have been identified.  One of these proteins is a                  carbonic anhydrase located in the periplasmic space and another                 is a 36 kDa membrane associated polypeptide located in intact                   chloroplasts.  The other three proteins are soluble and their                   function is unknown.  The role of the chloroplast in Ci                         accumulation is being characterized by determining Ci uptake in                 intact chloroplasts from wild-type and high CO2-requiring C.                    reinhardtii strains.  The role of the 36 kDa polypeptide in this                uptake process is also being investigated.  This protein is                     located on the chloroplast, possibly in the chloroplast envelope,               and may be responsible, in part, for the increase in Ci uptake                  observed in chloroplasts from low CO2-grown cultures.  The                      chloroplast carbonic anhydrase a low abundance, constitutively                  made protein that is required for efficient CO2 fixation is also                being studied.  The role of the three other low CO2-induced                     polypeptides is unknown.  A cDNA library is being made to mRNA                  isolated from low CO2-grown cells and differentially screened                   with cDNA made from mRNA from low and high CO2-grown cells.  This               will identify many of the low CO2-inducible genes required for                  growth on low CO2.  The eventual characterization of the proteins               of this transport system will increase our understanding of the                 low CO2 adjustment in algae and the role of the chloroplast in                  this photosynthetic adaptation.                                                                                                                                 Photosynthesis involves the photoassimilation of carbon dioxide                 (CO2) and the photoevolution of oxygen (O2).  Partly due to this                gas exchange activity of plants, earth's atmosphere changed in                  composition from one that was high in CO2 and low in O2 to one                  that is high in O2 and low in CO2.  Under current conditions, the               rate of CO2 fixation and thus plant growth, can be limited by                   CO2.  Many unicellular algae can adapt to low CO2 conditions so                 that they become very efficient in their utiliation of CO2 for                  photosynthesis.  This adaptation results from an enhancement of                 the cells' ability to transport and accumulate inorganic carbon.                These studies characterize the protein components required for                  the efficient use of CO2 in the green alga Chlamydomonas                        reinhardtii.  Emphasis is placed on the role of the chloroplast                 in inorganic carbon acquisition.",
