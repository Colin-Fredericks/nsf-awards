 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research project is designed to recover the                   historical relationships of pipid frogs of the genera Silurana                  and Xenopus and their fossil relatives.  Whereas living frogs of                these genera are only know from sub-Saharan Africa, fossils                     (dating from the Upper Cretaceous) occur in Africa and South                    America, thereby suggesting that the ancestors of the Recent and                fossil species may have been widespread on these continents                     before they split.  Silurana and Xenopus long have been the                     subject of biological and biomedical research (e.g.,                            developmental and genetic studies, immunobiology, gene-mapping,                 etc.), yet we do not know how many species there are or their                   relationships to one another, nor is there any authority to                     identify individual species.  The goal of this study is to                      integrate the information that exists for these taxa (e.g.,                     biochemical, cytological, behavioral) with anatomical (e.g.,                    ostelogical , myological, morphometric) data that will be                       gathered from adults and developing young in order to (1)                       identify individual species, (2) determine their                                interrelationships, (3) describe evolutionary pattern of                        chromosome, nucleic acids, and morphological features, (4) assess               levels of differentiation between sister-species, and (5) combine               the various data sets of fossil and Recent organisms to                         reconstruct the evolutionary history of the group.",
