 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the 1930's, the United States Government sponsored large                 Work Projects Administration (WPA) archaeological research                      projects in Eastern and Southeastern Texas.  Many of the                        excavated sites were extensive and yielded large numbers of                     artifacts.  These are currently housed at the Texas Archeological               Research Laboratory (TARL), a unit of the University of Texas at                Austin.  Unfortunately, these important materials are poorly                    stored.  They are difficult to use for research purposes and in                 danger of losing their scientific value.                                                                                                                        With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Hester and his                    colleagues will continue to upgrade collection storage and                      documentation.  They will reinventory the materials and check                   them against item-by-item lists compiled at WPA central                         laboratories.  The artifacts will then be reclassified and                      repackaged to prevent damage.  The data will then be entered into               TARL's computerized collections management data base.                           Accompanying documents will also be properly stored and assessed                for possible conservation.                                                                                                                                      This project is important for several reasons.  The WPA                         collections constitute an extremely important archaeological                    resource which can shed light on the prehistory of the southern                 United States.  However, because of their poor state of curation,               they are extremely difficult to use.  The planned work by Dr.                   Hester and staff will remedy this situation.",
