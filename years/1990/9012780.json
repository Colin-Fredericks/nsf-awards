 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research on market uncertainty, the                      uncertainty generated by the economy itself.  In particular, the                project analyzes the stability of sunspot equilibria from various               models (1) in the face of more general lottery devices and (2) in               the face of the possibility of the formation of coalitions of                   cooperating individuals.  The initial phase of this research effort             will be an outgrowth of the analysis of stochastic equilibria in                economies with indivisible commodities.  The project also continues             the analysis of the role of government tax policies in the                      intertemporal allocation of resources, including their role in                  economies in which there is market uncertainty.                                                                                                                 Economic actors must make decision in face of uncertainty.  Some                of this uncertainty is the result of uncertainty about economic                 fundamentals-- tastes, endowments, production possibilities, and                even government policies.  This type of uncertainty is successfully             modelled by conventional general economic equilibrium theory.  This             project addressed another, significant source of uncertainty which              individuals actually face.  This is market uncertainty, uncertainty             generated within the economy itself, uncertainty about the economic             outcomes (such as prices, net trades, employment, and the inflation             rate) given the fundamental parameters.  Businessmen, for example,              wonder whether consumers' confidence will be high or low, whether               credit will be loose or tight, whether the dollar will be strong                or weak, and so forth.  Market uncertainty is a subject of obvious              social importance.  Macroeconomists, for example, ask what policies             should the government take to counteract disturbances generated by              the economy itself.  When we design organizations -- or, more                   generally choose mechanisms -- we shall want to know how                        uncertainty is created and transmitted by these new organizational              forms. This project contributes to our understanding of this type               of uncertainty by extending formal models of market uncertainty,                i.e., the so-called \"sunspot equilibrium\" models pioneered by the               investigator.",
