 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Comprehensive program of research is planned that is centered                 on the oxygen isotope analyses of phosphate from both natural                   materials and various forms of apatite that will be synthesized                 in the laboratory.  Specific goals are (1) the refinement of the                method of preparation and isotopic analysis of phosphatic oxygen,               (2) the experimental determination of the equilibrium oxygen                    isotope fractionation factors between dissolved phosphate and                   water and between various crystalline apatites and water over a                 very large range of temperatures from near Oo to 8OOoC, (3) the                 development of a single mineral oxygen isotope thermometer based                on hydroxapatite and application to natural systems, (5) the use                of 18O contents of teeth and bones to make important distinctions               between marine and fresh water fish.                                            Some novel techniques will be employed in conducting this                       research.  The extraction of oxygen from very small samples of                  phosphate will be made with a laser fluorination system recently                established at the University of Michigan.  Catalysts will be                   used                                                                            to obtain exchange equilibrium between phosphates and water at                  relatively low temperatures.  Well crystallized hydroxy-and                     fluorapatite will be synthesized by a bacterial reaction in which               enzymatic activity should promote attainment of isotopic exchange               equilibrium.  Obtaining reliable equilibrium fractionation                      factors in these systems over a large temperature range will be                 extremely useful in the resolution of a variety of petrological,                paleoclimatological and paleoecological problems.",
