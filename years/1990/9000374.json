The                        contractor maintains a panel of 1,100 higher education                          institutions and conducts up to five \"quick response\"                           surveys a year.  These limited-item surveys are done on                         topics submitted by the three sponsoring federal                                agencies (NSF, NEH, and DOE) and cover issues that                              relate to their operations.  Survey results are used to                         provide timely responses to specific high priority,                             programmatic, policy or Congressional reporting needs.
