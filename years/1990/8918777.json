 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flow fields and associated convective heat transfer rates                       induced by acoustic streaming are to be investigated                            analytically and by computer simulation.  Specifically, three                   flow fields will be studied:  an isolated sphere; the Kundt                     tube; a sphere placed at a node in the Kundt tube.  These are                   the configurations of primary importance to containerless                       materials processing in space, for which spherical samples re                   levitated by an acoustic field in a test cell.                                                                                                                  The proposed study will provide Nusselt Number correlations                     for heat transfer for acoustic streaming flows in the above                     configurations with sound frequencies and amplitudes                            comparable to those used in space levitation applications, and                  with gases with Prandtl numbers of 0(1).  The analysis will                     also include the effects of gravity to enable correlation of                    earth-based experiments, but will be limited to situation                       where the particle size is much smaller than the sound wave-                    length.  For the Kundt tube problem, the effect of                              distribution of heat on the walls of the tube will be studied                   to extract information on acoustic streaming heat transfer in                   a furnace-like environment.",
