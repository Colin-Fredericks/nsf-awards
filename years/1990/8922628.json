This conference, which is being convened at the                   recommendation of the NSF Chemistry Advisory Committee, brings                  together some twenty-five young American and British scientists                 who are likely to be the future leaders in this field.                                                                                                          Molecular recognition involves the study of weak intermolecular                 forces and the role that they play in the formation of complexes                or assemblies between two or more chemical entities.  The                       complexity and specificity of biochemical processes depends                     critically on the controlled and effective use of non-covalent                  interactions in the binding and recognition processes between                   biomolecules.  This leads to the remarkable properties of                       biological systems such as enzymes, DNA, antibodies, and                        membranes.  The primary aim of this Bilateral NSF-SERC Conference               on Molecular Recognition is to expose young scientists to the                   wider community of international scholarship and to build the                   foundation for long term international collaborations.",
