 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will study the effects of asthenospheric flow on                   continental deformation.  The models to be used are extensions of               thin viscous sheet models that have been used before to study                   continental compression and thickening in Tibet and crustal                     extension in the Aegean, which now include the effects of shear                 tractions on the base of the lithosphere that may arise from flow               in the asthenosphere.  The effects of these has been illustrated                by some simple analytical models of subduction under S. America,                shere the descending plate induces flow that exerts tractions on                the base of the lithosphere; these results indicate that the                    effect may be important, and may provide a mechanism that could                 lead to embayments of the coastline (as in Peru) and a broad zone               of crustal thickening (the Altiplano), both associated with a                   steeper angle of subduction, as is observed.  The work will use a               more complete model to investigate this, utilizing a finite                     element code similar that used in previous work.  The PIs will                  also study the deformation of Tibet, and investigate whether                    asthenospheric flow associated with large scale plate motions can               account for the asymmetry of the crustal thickening and the                     extension towards the northeast that is observed.  The work will                provide a foundation for understanding the role of                              sublithospheric tractions in continental deformation in other                   environments.",
