 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale distributed multicomputer systems, consisting of several            thousand processing elements, are rapidly demonstrating their                   potential as a low cost high performance supercomputer.  Not only can           these system speed-up program execution, but they also allow                    significantly larger problems to be addressed.  A wide-spread use of            these systems, however, in mission critical as well as commercial               applications, depends on their demonstrated reliability, availability           and scalability.                                                                                                                                                The objective of this research project is to investigate the                    reliability, scalability and performability of large-scale distributed          systems.  As the number of elements in a system increases, the rate of          failure of the system is expected to increase given a constant                  technology.  Therefore system reliability and scalability are                   important considerations in the design of large-scale systems.  The             research will focus on two essential issues: the analysis of network            reliability and performability, and the evaluation of techniques that           can exploit the inherent redundancy of these systems.  The network              reliability analysis will examine the effects of multiple node and              link failures on the connectivity of the network and on its                     communication bandwidth, investigating the probability of occurrence            of network disconnection, saturation and communication bottlenecks.             The inherent hardware redundancy of large-scale systems can be                  exploited to achieve a higher reliability, albeit, at the cost of a             reduced computing power.  The second objective will be to investigate           the achievable performance/reliability tradeoff and system scalability          using various redundancy schemes.                                                                                                                               The research is essentially analytical in nature but will rely on               simulation techniques whenever an exact analytical evaluation is not            feasible.",
