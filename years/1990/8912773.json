 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research supported in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   Organometallic Chemistry Program, Theodore L. Brown of the                      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will investigate                    the kinetics and mechanisms of organometallic reactions. The                    focus will be mainly on transition-metal carbonyl complexes and                 specifically on the properties of reaction intermediates                        formed in the course of organometallic reactions. These studies                 are important for the fundamental understanding of organo-                      metallic chemistry and catalytic processes involving organo-                    metallic compounds.                                                                                                                                             One class of reaction intermediate to be studied is the metal                   carbonyl radicals, which possess an odd number of electrons                     (often seventeen or nineteen) in the metal valence orbitals. A                  second class of intermediate is formed by loss of a ligand,                     usually carbon monoxide, bound to the metal. The technique of                   flash photolysis using a dinitrogen laser will be employed to                   study these intermediates. Another aspect of the research will                  involve a comprehensive study of the steric and electronic                      properties of ligands, primarily phosphorus ligands. The                        approach will involve experimental studies of appropriate                       series of reactions; compilation of these results and results                   from a large body of existing literature; and analysis of these                 data with new statistically valid methods. The end result may                   be a useful system for effective design of catalysts by using                   ligands which impart predictable and desirable properties to                    the catalysts.",
