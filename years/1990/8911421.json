This project will investigate                 the effect of water movement on several aspects of the feeding                  biology of corals.  The first portion of the project will measure               field rates of feeding of three species of coral, Montastrea                    annularis, Eusmilia fastigiata and Porites porites with prey                    sampling by an automated pump/sampler array that allows                         concurrent measurement of water flow (thermistor flowmeter,                     video), irradiance (Licor quantum irradiance meter) and prey                    availability (DO pump sampler).  Feeding experiments on expansion               and contraction behavior and feeding during several diel cycles.                A self-contained underwater thermistor flowmeter with a 2 mm                    spatial resolution has been constructed and tested for this                     research based on the design of LaBarbera and Vogel (1976).  The                data collected will be used to characterize the general flow                    regime at the site (mainstream flow at several points along depth               transects using the Interocean S4 recording current meter),                     providing new information about the flow environment on coral                   reefs in St. Croix at the NOAA National Undersea Research                       Program's AQUARIUS habitat.",
