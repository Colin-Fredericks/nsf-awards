 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant to support the Symposium \"Computer-Enhanced                          Analytical Spectroscopy\" is in the general area of analytical                   and surface chemistry and in the subfield of computer-based                     research.  This request would provide five beginning untenured                  Assistant Professors and faculty from undergraduate                             institutions the opportunity to attend and participate in a                     Symposium on Computer-Enhanced Analytical Spectroscopy, June                    6-8, 1990, in Snowbird, Utah.                                                                                                                                   The goal of this symposium is to provide a direct interface                     between analytical spectroscopy and chemometrics.  The aim is                   to create excitement about contemporary methods at this                         interface with the result that these faculty will return to                     their institutions and be more effective in conveying this                      enthusiasm to students who may be swayed towards a career in                    science.  Selection criteria will include the above point, the                  quality of the applicant's teaching and research background,                    and the possible impact on improving participation of women and                 minorities in chemistry.",
