 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern instruments are powerful tools of analysis and their use is              emphasized in the beginning organic chemistry laboratory, where the             students learn of gas and high performance liquid chromatographs                (GC, HPLC), and infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, ultraviolet,              and mass spectrometers.  These instruments, especially  the IR and              GC, are used extensively not only for simple analysis of products               from reactions and distillations but for the separation of complex              mixtures to test mechanistic hypotheses (carbocation                            rearrangements).  Undergraduate research is receiving increased                 emphasis at the institution.  In a small college all instruments                serve not only the beginning and upper class labs but the research              students as well, so these instruments must produce quality data                under demanding conditions and must be flexible enough to meet                  unanticipated new demands.  Through this project, the institution               upgraded its organic chemistry instrumentation.  They acquired an               easy-to-teach Fourier-transform IR and a capillary column GC.  The              new instruments provided significantly better data, allowed several             new experiments to be performed, and enabled the faculty to teach               new technologies.  The institution contributed to this project in               an amount equal to the NSF funds.",
