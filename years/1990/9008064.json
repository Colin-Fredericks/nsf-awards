This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Jerome Cohen is to                   support a 15 month visit by Dr. Carla J. Shute to Sweden to                     work with Professor Torsten Ericsson of the Institute of                        Technology in Link\u001aping on \"X-Ray Analysis of Thin Film                         Materials Including Wear Resistant Coatings and Superlattice                    Structure.\"  The properties of thin film materials are of                       considerable interest due to their enhanced mechanical                          behavior over bulk specimens of the same material.  The                         researchers will examine two types of thin film structures:                     TiN wear resistant coatings and Mo/V superlattice structures.                   They will examine the residual stresses in both of these                        materials by the sin.theta polycrystalline x-ray diffraction                    technique.  For the TiN films, the researchers will study the                   mechanism of compressive stress generation during growth                        under low energy ion bombardment.  For the Mo/V superlattices,                  they will examine the tetragonal strain distortion theories                     for the supermodulus effect.  The supermodulus effect is a                      two-three fold increase in the elastic modulus of thin film                     modulated structures observed for a small range of wavelengths                  of the composition modulation.  They will also make measure-                    ments of the tetragonal strain, gradient in strain near the                     interface, and strength and coherency of the interface as a                     function of the wavelength of the modulation to determine if                    coherency strains can explain this enhanced mechanical                          behavior.                                                                                                                                                       The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
