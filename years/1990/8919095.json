 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Elizabeth Brumfiel                will conduct archaeological excavation and exploration in the                   Xaltocan region of the northern basin of Mexico.  Xaltocan was an               ancient political center located ca. 35 kilometers north of                     modern Mexico City.  In 1987, Dr. Brumfiel conducted extensive                  surface survey of the area and that research provides the                       baseline for the current project.  She will excavate ca. 20 2x2                 meter test pits, in addition to two deep excavations.  Using                    these data she will pursue several goals.  First, since this                    Northern Basin region is not well known, she will develop a                     ceramic chronology which will provide a basis for the assignment                of individual surface sites.  Secondly, she will examine the                    relationship between surface and subsurface occurrences, and this               will allow researchers to determine how well surface materials                  reflect what lies below in sealed contexts.                                                                                                                     This research is of interest for several reasons.  Many large                   surface surveys have been conducted in the Basin of Mexico and                  based on these results, demographic reconstructions attempted.                  However, it is unclear how valid it is to use surface materials                 in this way, and Dr. Brumfiel's work will provide the basis for                 such an assessment.  Given rapid urbanization in the Basin and                  the consequent destruction of archaeological sites, future                      researchers will have to rely increasingly on surface survey                    data, and in this context Dr. Brumfiel's research assumes great                 importance.  It is also known from ethnohistorical literature                   that Xaltocan played a critical role in the late prehispanic                    Mexico, yet the area has not been studied in an archaeologically                systematic fashion.  This is just what Dr. Brumfiel proposes to                 do.                                                                                                                                                             The project is also important because it will support research at               an undergraduate institution, will directly involve students in                 the work, and, therefore, hopefully encourage them and their                    classmates to pursue scientific careers.",
