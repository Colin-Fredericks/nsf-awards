 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of 15 U.S.                    scientists in a joint Indo-U.S. Workshop on computer in                         mineral industry planning, engineering and management planned                   for January 1991 in Calcutta, India.  The Indian coordinator                    is Dr. D. K. Sinha, Director, Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad,                  India.  The activities will include a three-day seminar,                        visits to mining operations and mining management/engineering                   offices in India, to be followed by a two-day round table                       discussions on emerging research needs.  The seminar will                       include presentations on recent developments in mineral                         industry, and education and training of engineers and                           managers.  In the round table, joint Indo-U.S. research                         projects will be outlined for future collaboration.  Topics to                  be discussed will include:  automated data acquisition in                       mineral exploration, statistical modeling for quality                           estimates of mineral resources and reserves; factors affecting                  mine planning, development and operation; economic and risk                     analysis aspects of mining; mineral processing; maintenance                     and scheduling; remote control, automation, robotics and                        artificial intelligence systems; and applications of national                   data bases for safety and health, productivity and regional                     and national planning.                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This workshop brings U.S. and Indian scientists and                     engineers to discuss an area of importance to both countries.                   The idea of the workshop was recommended by the Indo-U.S.                       subcommission on Science and Technology in its most recent                      meeting (November 1987).  The project is likely to enhance                      future collaboration between academic and industrial                            organizations in the two countries and to allow for the                         exchange of information developed independently in India and                    the U.S.",
