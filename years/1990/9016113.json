 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to introduce Alaskan Native                            undergraduate students to scientific study through marine                       internships.  The rationale is that the coastal Native                          populations of Alaska have a deep involvement with the marine                   environment, and especially with its biological resources.                      Marine science is therefore likely to be more attractive to                     them initially than other areas of science.  Students in their                  sophomore, or possibly freshman, year at selected coastal                       institutions, as well as the University of Alaska Fairbanks                     campuses, will be offered the opportunity to participate in                     marine science internships.  Working closely with a faculty                     mentor, each student will learn about research through hands-on                 experience as well as individual tutoring.  Students at coastal                 sites will be encouraged to move to a senior campus to pursue                   baccalaureate degrees in scientific areas, and those that chose                 to do so would receive continued support and mentoring to                       encourage their success. Approximately five student fellowships                 are to be offered each year of this three year project.",
