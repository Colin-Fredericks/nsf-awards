 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the department of Linguistics at the               University of California, San Diego to help purchase a spectrograph             (an instrument that analyzes sound waves).  The equipment will be               used in the Phonetics Laboratory, and will improve those courses                in the undergraduate linguistics curriculum that include a                      component relating to acoustic phonetics, a core sub-field of                   phonetics that includes the study of the physical properties of                 speech sounds.  With the aid of this instrument, students will                  learn about phonetics:  the relationship among the way that the                 sounds are perceived.  During in-class demonstrations and                       experiments and in conducting their own experiments, the                        interactive nature of this spectrograph additionally will allow the             students to learn the scientific method, how to form and test                   hypotheses, and how to design an experiment.  The grantee is                    matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
