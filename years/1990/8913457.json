 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a collaborative project between                         Dr. Peter T. Cummings of the University of Virginia and                         Dr. D.J. Evans of the Australian National University.  This                     research is to better predict and understand the transport                      properties (shear viscosity, thermal conductivity and                           diffusivities) of several representative classes of simple                      fluids, liquid metals and molecular fluids and mixtures in                      terms of the microscopic forces between molecules.  The                         research is innovative in that algorithms developed only very                   recently will be applied to understanding transport properties,                 with the potential of significant advances in rigorously                        justified computationally efficient simulation techniques of                    predicting transport properties.                                                                                                                                The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      Australian researcher due to his unique expertise in non-                       equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) algorithms and Cummings'                  on-going, NSF-supported comprehensive simulation studies of                     transport properties.  More accurate prediction of transport                    properties is crucial to successful chemical process design                     and optimization, a key technology in the development of                        manufacturing processes to the U.S. chemical industry.",
