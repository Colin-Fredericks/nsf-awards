 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the integration of visual and                        cognitive information across eye movements in reading.  During                  each eye fixation in reading, skilled readers acquire effective                 information from the word directly fixated and the next word in                 the text.  In general, the word directly fixated is fully                       identified; the next word in the text, usually referred to as the               parafoveal word, is \"pre-viewed\" but not  identified.  These                    experiments will examine the nature of this word preview process.               One group of experiments will examine whether skilled readers use               parafoveal word previews to acquire useful word length                          information and effective orthographic/lexical information.  A                  second group of experiments will examine whether the usefulness                 of parafoveal word previews is a function of the sentential                     context within which these words occur.  In each experiment,                    skilled readers' eye movements will be recorded while they read                 single sentences.  During sentence reading, a stimulus available                parafoveally will be replaced with a target word after completion               of the eye movement from the fixated word to the parafoveal                     stimulus.  The linguistic relationship between the stimulus                     available paravfoveally and the target word subsequently fixated                will be varied to determine which type of effective visual and                  cognitive information was obtained from the parafoveal stimulus                 preview.                                                                                                                                                        The outcome of this research will reveal how learned perceptual                 and cognitive skills contribute to the effective \"pre-viewing\" of               parafoveally available words in skilled reading.  This may assist               the development of remedial reading programs for people who lack                sufficient development of these skills.",
