 "awd_abstract_narration": "REU site project on infrastructure innovations is designed to attract           native born students to research careers in this area within civil              engineering and to lead participants toward independent research.               Recent reports have concluded that there is a critical need for more            research in innovative means of maintenance and rehabilitation of our           infrastructure.  Research projects include behavior of fiber-                   reinforced composite pvfs materials, holographic measurement of the             fracture process increment, increasing transportation system capacity           by changing patterns of usage, and innovative infrastructure                    enhancement.  Student interaction is maintained by twice a week                 orientation meetings which address research skills common to all work,          as well as informal chats with the REU professors to convey the                 excitement of a research career.  Research results are presented both           orally and in a report of sufficient quality for publications to                ensure training in technical communication.",
