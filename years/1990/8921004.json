 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on modeling of the                         movement of groundwater pollutants.  The specific                               objective of this project is to devise a methodology for                        prediction of the movement of a specific, principal                             contaminant regardless of its stochastic properties,                            concentration or location in the mathematical model.                            Additionally, the investigator is considering sources of                        uncertainty relative to contaminant migration beyond those                      attributable to aquifer conductivity.  He is exploring new                      foundations in functional-analytic theory (stochastic                           evolution equations, semigroups of operators, stochastic                        differential equations in Hilbert space) blended with some                      results on the classical heat flow equation in order to                         obtain new solutions of the advective dispersive transport                      equation in porous media subject to a general stochastic                        disturbance.                                                                                                                                                    The project is expected to produce a new systematic and                         general modeling procedure by which the stochastic                              properties of the concentration process can be predicted                        based on the stochastic properties of the disturbing                            stochastic process(es) at the boundary conditions, the                          source terms and/or the parameters.  Additionally, it is                        expected that the variances of the processes will not be                        restricted to small magnitudes as it is the case with                           conventional perturbation techniques.",
