 "awd_abstract_narration": "It remains unclear how the chemistry of certain compounds causes                them to taste \"sweet.\"  Most studies have addressed how certain                 molecular substructures of the stimulus molecule should match                   certain molecular properties of binding sites on the cell                       surfaces.  But some compounds taste sweet without having the                    presumed important features, and some compounds that have the                   prescribed features do not taste sweet.  This project will use a                novel approach utilizing the full three-dimensional structure of                tastant molecules and receptor sites, instead of having a focus                 on just a particular substructure or functional group on the                    molecule.  Five classes of compounds known to have sweet or                     bitter taste to humans will be studied.  Computational facilities               will analyze how the electrostatic fields of a whole molecule may               interact with the receptor site before the actual \"binding\"                     occurs, and determine an optimal orientation of the molecule to                 fit the receptor site.  Knowledge of the relation between                       molecular structure and biological function is basic to the                     understanding of how various systems such as receptors, ion                     channels, and enzymes work, and results from this study will                    have broad impact on all those fields.  This project also has  a                strong undergraduate component that will considerably enhance the               scientific quality of education at the institutions involved.",
