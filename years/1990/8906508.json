 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project addresses the role that architectural                     precast cladding systems can and should play in the seismic                     response of building structures.  Architectural precast is                      often dismissed as nonstructural and does not normally form                     part of either precast frame or wall-panel building                             construction.  Nevertheless, architectural precast panels are                   widely used on steel and reinforced concrete frame buildings,                   and therefore this segment of the precast industry constitutes                  an important part of the overall market for this type of                        construction.                                                                                                                                                   The research explores the possible use of precast panels and                    their attachments to the structure in an integrated building                    cladding system to provide both increased lateral stiffness                     and damping for the structure as a whole.  Analytical models                    are formulated and laboratory tests conducted for promising                     advanced connection designs that offer improved energy                          dissipation, ductility and failure characteristics/modes when                   compared to present precast cladding systems.  Results of the                   project are expected to include an improved understanding of                    behavior of heavy cladding systems on modern buildings during                   earthquakes and the development of both conceptual models and                   results for particular integrated cladding designs.",
