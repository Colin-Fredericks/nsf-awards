 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support to continue a symposium                     series on \"Current Topics in Plant Biochemistry and Physiology\".                These symposia are sponsored by the Interdisciplinary Plant                     Biochemistry and Physiology Group of the University of Missouri-                Columbia.  The purpose of the \"Current Topics in Plant                          Biochemistry and Physiology Symposium\" is to promote awareness of               advances in research in interrelated areas of plant biology by                  providing a forum for the exhange of scientific information and                 by catalyzing the generation of new ideas and interactions.                     Topics focus on 3 or 4 areas ranging from molecular to whole-                   plant studies.  The Symposium environment enhances the crucial                  personal interaction among students, postdoctorates and                         researchers from a broad range of research disciplines.  The                    Proceedings of the Symposia have been and will continue to be                   published.                                                                                                                                                      This symposium series provides a lively forum for students to                   become involved in the development of science.  The choice of                   multiple topics rather than a single topic enchances the                        interdisciplinary nature of the Symposium, facilitates                          information transfer to a wider audience and promotes personal                  interaction between students and researchers of more than one                   research area.  The meeting is held annually in the spring at the               University of Missouri-Columbia.",
