 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many researchers have found that the life cycle/permanent income                theory of consumption fails to explain movements of aggregate                   consumption and savings. What does determine savings remains                    unclear, especially given that the motives behind savings are not               the same for all individuals. In particular, such motives are                   likely to differ significantly across groups of individuals with                different levels of lifetime incomes and/or different profiles of               lifetime incomes.                                                                                                                                               In this project, a data set is developed on lifetime incomes and                consumption paths using data from the Panel Study on Income                     Dynamics and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. The lifetime data                 will then be used to ascertain to what extent the life cycle                    theory explains observed patterns for different types of                        consumers. For each consumer category, observed patterns of total               consumption will be compared with those predicted by the life-                  cycle theory and those predicted by alternative explanations.                   These alternatives include \"rules of thumb\", the \"behavioral\"                   life-cycle hypothesis, the presence of liquidity constraints, and               myopia.                                                                                                                                                         The final stage of the research is to go beyond casual                          empiricism and develop more appropriate econometric tests for the               alternative explanations. Consumption function and Euler equation               approaches will be among those considered; however, more powerful               tests may be possible given the wealth of information that will                 be available in the lifetime data set. The result of this                       research will be a better understanding of what determines                      savings.",
