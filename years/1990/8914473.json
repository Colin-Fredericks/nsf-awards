 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Marshall             Slemrod, University of Wisconsin and two French applied mathe-                  maticians:  Professor Michel Rascle, University of Nice and                     Professor Denis Serre, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon.  The                   objective of the project is to study the existance of solutions to              systems of conservation laws arising in continuum mechanics.  In                particular, the investigators will study the decay, propagation                 and creation of oscillations using the tools of compensated                     compactness and the Young measure.                                                                                                                              One of the most important branches of partial differential                      equations is the area of conservation laws.  In fact most mechanical            systems are described by such equations, e.g. motion of elastic                 bodies, gases fluids, plasmas, etc.  Hence their study both                     analytically and numerically is exceptionally important.  In the                proposed project, the investigators will focus on the following:                1) dynamics of the Young measure associated with a sequence of                  approximate solutions 2) systems of conservation laws describing                phase transitions.  Dr. Slemrod and his French colleagues are                   leading researchers in a small group of mathematicians working on               the analysis of physically reasonable problems in conservation                  laws.  Solution of the proposed problems would be a significant                 step toward the understanding of one of the central problems of                 modern applied mathematics:  the dynamics of discontinuous,                     oscillatory, measure-valued physical systems.",
