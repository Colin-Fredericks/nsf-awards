 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will identify and weight factors influencing                  upward and downward socio-economic mobility through analysis of                 the Current Population Surveys for 1973 through 1987.  Methods                  include description of rates by gender and race, loglinear                      analyses, multinominal analyses, and logistic regression analy-                 ses.  These methods permit examination of mobility determinants                 taking into account individual factors in addition to race and                  gender, and changing organizational structures.  Individual                     determinants and organizations have not been included in previous               work due to lack of statistical tools to include them.  They are                important because there is wide individual variation in success                 rates within race and gender categories, and because most mobil-                ity occurs within organizations, whose opportunity structures                   change with economic changes and other factors.  Results of this                study will show changes in mobility which have occurred recently                due to such factors as laws against discrimination in promotions,               growth of service sector employment, increasing employment of                   women outside the home, and declines in durable goods manufac-                  turing.",
