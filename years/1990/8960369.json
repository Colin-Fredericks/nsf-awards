 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iterative methods for solving sparse linear systems require                     significantly fewer arithmetic operations and less memory than                  currently popular direct methods.  However, for very large                      problems, for example as derived from discretizations of partial                differential equations in three space variables, it is still                    necessary to use secondary storage devices to store the required                data.  This project will develop an efficient out-of-core version               of our powerful sparse preconditioned conjugate gradient                        iterative method package, PCGPAK.  This will involve the                        development and implementation of new algorithms which attempt to               minimize disk traffic and overlap required reads and writes with                computation as much as possible.  Analysis leads one to believe                 that one can develop a package whose performance will be CPU                    bound (as distinct from I/O bound) on most reasonably balanced                  computer systems for most problems of common interest.                                                                                                          An out-of-core PCGPAK would allow users to solve arbitrarily                    large sparse linear systems with great speed without paying the                 penalty of using secondary storage devices.  Furthermore, users                 would not have to concern themselves with the intricate details                 involved with efficient I/O programming.                                                                                                                        An out-of-core PCGPAK has outstanding commercial potential.  The                oil industry is a concrete example of where such a package would                be used immediately.  All commercial simulators have an                         \"Everything but the linear system\" out-of-core option now and                   would include an out-of-core linear system solver -- if an                      adequate one existed.  Other industries with a clear need for                   such a commercial product include the aerospace, fluids, and                    structures industries.",
