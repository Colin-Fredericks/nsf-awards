 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Science in Developing Countries award will support a                       regional workshop in mathematics organized by Professor                         Joseph Kohn of Princeton University and mathematicians from                     the Centro de Matematica, Universidad Central del Ecuador                       under the direction of Professor Ronaldo Saenz Andrade.  The                    workshop will involve up to five representatives from the                       different Bolivarian countries (Panama, Venezuela, Colombia,                    Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia) plus Chile, with an emphasis on                     the selection of young and active mathematicians interested                     in increasing communication with the international mathematical                 community.  In addition, there will be participation of a                       number of outstanding European mathematicians who will be                       supported by their own countries.                                                                                                                               The workshop will include the following activities:  lectures,                  round table discussions, and a mini-course with ample                           opportunities for informal discussions.  The teaching of                        mathematics and the promotion of research activities will be                    emphasized, taking into account the experiences of the                          attendees.  The participation of a distinguished group of                       U.S. mathematicians, who are knowledgeable about the problems                   of doing research and teaching in Latin America, is likely to                   lead to improved communication and increased mathematical                       activity in the region.",
