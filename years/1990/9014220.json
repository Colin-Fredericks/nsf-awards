 "awd_abstract_narration": "To exercise leadership, science and engineering educators need to               provide their students with the tools to identify and respond                   appropriately to professional problems with ethical dimensions.                 This project will develop an innovative campus-wide program                     integrating ethics into the professional curriculum, a program                  professional societies could adapt to their continuing education                programs.  The project has four steps: 1) developing and offering               workshops for IIT faculty in how to teach professional ethics in                how to teach professional ethics in their technical courses;                    1) providing institutional support (a continuing seminar, case                  file, videos, and so on) for faculty introducing professional                   ethics into their technical courses; 3) redesigning existing                    capstone courses to include a design program requiring ethical                  difficult cooperation among students in two or more professional                programs; and 4) disseminating results through a day-and-a-half                 working conference for staff and volunteers in continuing education             programs of professional societies and a weeklong version of the                workshop for faculty of other universities, as well as through                  presentations at professional meetings and publications in                      appropriate journals.                                                                                                                                           This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethics and Values                 Studies.  The investigators are very well qualified; the plan is                thoughtful and feasible; university support is extremely good.                  Results are likely to improve the teaching of engineering                       ethics on this campus and in undergraduate curricula nationwide.                                                                                                Based on the merits of the proposal and the generally positive                  review, support is highly recommended.",
