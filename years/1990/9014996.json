 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a geometry, electronic structure may be calculated for even               very complex materials within the local density approximation.                  However, geometrical sturctures of very complex materials or                    disordered systems are often not known.  A major step toward the                achievement of first principle predictions of the structural and                dynamical properties of very complex materials has been made                    possible by the Car-Parrinello method of ab intio molecular                     dynmics stimulation.  While this approach when implemented on                   supercomputers allows the simulation of many interesting problems               of even more importance are still to large. On the otherhand,                   the appearance of the massively parallel processor architecture                 of the machine is taken into account.  Preliminary testing of                   Car-Parrinello simulation on the Connection Machine indicates                   that it maps well onto parallel architectures.  Provided that the               code is fully optimized for the Connection Machine it will be                   possible to predict strutural and dynamical properties of complex               materials form first principles.  Examples would include                        simulation of surface oxidation, molecular/cluster interaction                  with surfaces and ab initio studies of scanning tunnel microscope               and atom force microscope images.",
