 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will use                        analytical and numerical tools to study the long-time behavior                  of solutions of certain dissipative partial differential                        equations such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the                     Navier-Stokes equations.  Of particular interest is the                         approximation of a set called the global attractor, which is a                  finite-dimensional, fractal set that lies inside of an infinite-                dimensional phase space.  In order to describe the global                       attractor the principal investigators plan to construct an                      algebraic approximation method that uses smooth finite-                         dimensional manifolds to approximate the fractal set and then to                implement this method on a computer.                                                 From an abstract point of view one can regard the solutions                of a partial differential equation as generating a space of                     trajectories or curves that is infinite-dimensional.  This is one               reason why the study of such equations is difficult.                            Fortunately, though, within this infinite-dimensional space                     reside sets of finite dimension that characterize how solutions                 behave for very large times.  And since these sets are finite-                  dimensional, it is possible to describe them approximately using                numerical and analytical techniques.  With this award the                       researchers will study finite-dimensional objects called global                 attractors that arise in the solution sets of equations from                    fluid dynamics.",
