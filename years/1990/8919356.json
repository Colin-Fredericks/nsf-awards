 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports five U.S. astronomers                       to attend a workshop on astronomical instrumentation to be                      held December 10-13, 1989, at the Inter-University Center                       for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) in Pune, India.  The                     Indian organizer is Dr. Jayant Narlikar, Director of the                        IUCAA.  The workshop is aimed at crystallizing a viable                         instrumentation program which would be carried out by the                       IUCAA in collaboration with the various research groups in                      Indian universities and institutions.  Among the activities                     to be considered are: focal plane instrumentation for                           optical, IR, and UV telescopes; payload for space missions;                     image processing; and fabrication of detectors and                              interferometers.  The instrumentation program would enable                      the IUCAA and scientists from Indian universities to use                        the extensive facilities for research in astronomy in                           India, including optical, solar, infrared, millemeter-wave,                     radio, and space astronomy.  It is hoped that the result                        will also enable Indian astronomers to work with similar                        facilities in the U.S. and other countries, and to                              participate in some of the major gravity wave detector                          programs.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  Although India has a strong record of scientific                        research in astronomy, the recent establishment of the                          IUCAA represents a major effort by India to accelerate the                      state of astronomy and astrophysics research to levels                          attained by more advanced countries.  This will enable                          Indian scientists to interact and collaborate more                              effectively with scientists from these countries.  The                          results of the workshop would further these objectives and                      greatly increase the potential for Indo-U.S. collaboration                      in astronomy.  The U.S. P.I. and the Indian counterpart are                     world renowned in the field and are most capable of                             conducting the workshop.",
