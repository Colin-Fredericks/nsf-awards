 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large peat basins of North America represent an                        important reservoir in the global carbon cycle and a significant                source of atmospheric methane.  Two target areas have been                      selected in these peat basins where peat nearly covers the                      regional landscape: 1) the Glacial Lake Agassiz peatlands of                    Minnesota and 2) the Albany River peatlands in northern Ontario.                These two areas represent important reference points along major                ecologic and climatic gradients.                                                     Dr. Glaser and Siegel will utilize a nested grid of sample                 points in these systems to determine 1) rates of carbon storage                 or loss, 2) rates and mechanisms of methane flux, and 3)                        hydrogeologic processes that control the flux of dissolved gases                and solutes through these peat deposits.  They will test four                   models of peatland development to determine if these peat basins                are sources, sinks, or steady-state reservoirs for carbon.  And                 regional estimates of the flux of methane and other dissolved                   solutes in the two study areas will be made with spatial                        statistics and hydrogeologic computer models.                                        This project is focused on an important reservoir of carbon                that may be intimately linked with climatic change. The research                program is being conducted by two highly regarded scientists who                have access to excellent facilities.  Results from this important               research will improve understanding of the processes that                       contribute to changes in the global environment.",
