 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six underrepresented undergraduates will be involved in field and               laboratory research to determine the origin of three problematic                glacial deposits in west-central Minnesota.  This  study will                   employ provenance analysis of soils and tills using; field pebble               counts, sedimentary petrography, X-ray diffraction and magnetic                 susceptibility to determine source area.  Provenance studies are                readily accomplished at the undergraduate level yet remain the                  fundamental method of studying glacial deposits in Minnesota.                   U.M.M., an undergraduate institution, offers excellent facilities               and close faculty contact.  R.E.U. students will have the                       opportunity to develop collegial ties with other undergraduates                 doing geologic research and to serve as mentors, instructors and                role models to underrepresented high school students                            participating in college level research.  The research experience               and the unique opportunity to interact with a scientific                        community where underrepresented individuals are i the majority                 will break down a number of traditional barriers and aid in the                 maturation of these students as scientists.  The culmination to                 the program, the \"Friends of UMM REU\" conference, will provide                  students ;with the opportunity to present results and discuss                   ideas with experts in the field.",
