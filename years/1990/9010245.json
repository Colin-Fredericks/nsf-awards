 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint research project is to be undertaken by Soviet and                      American scientists in the field of vision as a cooperative                     exchange effort.  The common goal is to elucidate the                           molecular basis of visual signaling.  The experimental objectives               are to identify, isolate and characterize the molecular                         components that detect light and achieve neural signaling and rod               and cone photoreceptor cells and to clone the genes that encode                 these protein components.  The plan is to adapt the recent                      techniques of micro-protein chemistry, molecular cloning, gene                  expression, and patch-clamp physiological studies to provide new                experimental tools and approaches for studying photoreceptor                    cells.  Working with the most current techniques of molecular                   biology, these scientists seek to establish the mechanisms                      underlying the triggering of visual information.                                                                                                                This joint venture draws on the strengths of research in the USSR               and US in vision.  The Soviet scientists provide particular                     expertise in protein chemistry and electrophysiological                         techniques.  The American scientists provide expertise in                       molecular cloning techniques and biochemical purification.                      Monies awarded for this project provide a stipend for living                    expenses to Soviet scientists during their research visit to the                University of Chicago and United States; the airfare for travel                 to the Soviet Union is covered for the American investigators                   visiting the Soviet Union.  By establishing a formal mechanism                  for joint research they hope to facilitate the exchange of ideas,               support exchange of ideas, support exchange of materials, and                   accelerate their goal of defining the basis of visual triggering.",
