 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of several studies in the area of labor                   economics: (1) the return to job seniority; (2) compensating wage               differentials; (3) the cyclical behavior of unemployment                        durations; (4) arbitration and mediation; and (5) changes in the                structure of wages. An important theme linking the first three                  projects is that the failure to account for the causes and                      effects of labor market mobility leads many conventional estimate               of the determinants of earnings and employment to be at least                   difficult to interpret and probably biased.                                                                                                                     In the first project, a systematic empirical investigation of the               transferability of the OLS return to tenure will be conducted. In               contrast with the existing research, data from a variety of                     samples will be used. A distinction will be made between those                  workers displaced by layoffs and those displaced by plant                       closings. At least two theoretical models will be developed that                emphasize different possible sources of transferable return. The                theoretical and empirical work will be integrated by testing the                predictions of the mover-stayer and match-quality models.                                                                                                       For the second project, a sample of workers displaced by plant                  closings will be used to study compensating wage differentials.                 This will allow an approximate solution to the problem of                       endogenous job  change in estimating differentials.                                                                                                             The third project will involve two sets of tests of the                         hypothesis that the increase in temporary layoffs during a                      recession is responsible for the finding that an increase in the                aggregate unemployment rate is associated with an increase in the               escape rate from unemployment. These tests will involve both a                  sample of displaced workers and a sample from the Panel Survey on               Income Dynamics.                                                                                                                                                The fourth project will extend the existing literature on dispute               resolution to incorporate mediation and allow the possibility                   that the mediator may be a self-interested agent. The theoretical               part of the project will involve modeling the learning process                  with particular attention to the timing of mediation relative to                other aspects of the dispute resolution mechanism and the                       potential for learning at various stages of the process. The                    empirical part of the project will involve investigating                        settlement rates and characteristics of agreements reached with                 and without mediation at different stages of the process.                                                                                                       The final project will examine changes in the structure of wages                in the U.S. and selected other OECD economies. One part will                    examine how the wage structure in the U.S. public sector has                    responded to changes in the wage structure in the private sector                during the 1970s and 1980s. The second part will compare changes                in wage differential by skill in the U.S. and other OECD                        countries.",
