 "awd_abstract_narration": "A classroom is equipped with workstations for twenty students and one           instructor thereby making possible three changes in the computer                science curriculum.  First, the courses for the computer science                major, particularly the first two courses, are taught in a more                 interactive manner.  During two hour laboratory periods, students               work on structured assignments under the supervision of the                     instructor.  Second, the project provides for a standard operating              system, Unix, and a powerful and standard computing environment, X              Windows, that are used across the curriculum.  UNIX is a standard in            the academic world and previously students had only limited access              to it.  Third, the laboratory provides a central place where computer           science majors work on individual and joint software projects while             having access to considerable computing power and system                        documentation. Equipment acquired for this project includes powerful            desktop microcomputers supporting UNIX (Sun Microsystems SPARCstation           I) and \"smart\" terminals having a full implementation of the X Window           standard (Visual Technologies X19).  The twenty-one stations are                networked to take advantage of a central mass storage device and a              shared printer, which are also available to any other terminal on               campus through the college computing network.  The award is being               matched with a greater amount (102%) by the principal investigator's            institution.",
