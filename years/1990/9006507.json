 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite numerous theoretical studies on evolution in                       heterogeneous environments and empirical studies  of genotype-                  environment interactions, patterns of variation in the selective                environment have been largely ignored by evolutionary biologists.               Theoretical studies have shown that the results of natural                      selection in heterogeneous environments depend critically on the                spatial and temporal scale of heterogeneity in the selective                    environment.  The selective environment is define by changes rank               order of fitness among genotypes (genotype-environment                          interactions).  The investigators will examine spatial and                      temporal heterogeneity of selection in an oldfield population of                Erigeron annuus, using three replicated asexual genotypes as                    \"photometers\"  to measure environmental heterogeneity.                          Seedlings of the  three genotypes will be planted in a sample                   grid and monitored for survivorship and fecundity. Areas of                     positive spatial autocorrelation of relative fitness will define                the selective patch, and this will be compared to variation in                  the physical environment.  This research will result in the first               map of the selective landscape and will show temporal changes in                the selective surface during succession.",
