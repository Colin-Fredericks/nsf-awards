 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Irwin Shapiro of Harvard University Observatory will                        direct a project which is national in scope to serve the                        average earth-science teacher.  The focus of the program is                     establishing a repository for existing earth science                            materials at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics                    (CFA).  Concurrently, during each of three years in a summer                    workshop, 40 master earth-science teachers will spend three                     weeks examining, evaluating existing activity-based earth-                      science materials and developing new materials to supplement                    them.  They will also attend a series of lectures on science                    and science education; discuss how to incorporate new                           information in earth-science in an activity based format;                       examine, evaluate, and summarize 80 activities on a variety                     of earth-science topics; produce a teacher activity resource                    book; and establish a schedule for master teachers to deliver                   workshops, using these materials, in local districts near                       their home.  The on-site workshops will be delivered during                     each of three academic years following the participant's                        summer at the CFA.  The first workshop will begin in the                        summer of 1990.  These workshops are based on the Physics                       Teacher Resource Agent (PTRA) model.                                                                                                                            A data base, already established for astronomy materials will                   be expanded to include other earth-science materials;                           geological, oceanographical and meteorological.  This will                      permit rapid access for teacher agents during the summer                        workshops and later by modem from their home school.  The                       latter would enable them to customize the on-site earth-                        science workshop, responding to local needs.  The database                      will include science, technology and society curriculum                         topics.                                                                                                                                                         An Advisory Panel composed of distinguished educators and                       research scientists will set the direction for the scientific                   content of materials and use of appropriate pedagogical                         practices.  The project is designed around the PTRA model.                      It will test its applicability to other audiences and                           disciplines.  It is based on an extensive national survey of                    earth-science teachers.  It responds to teachers content and                    on-site needs as well as their time constraints.  It builds                     upon a knowledge of the numerous excellent but dispersed                        existing earth-science curriculum materials and the very                        successful projects STAR and SPICA directed by the Principal                    Investigator.  This project titled Earth Science Teachers                       Exploring Exemplary Materials gives it its name, Project                        ESTEEM.                                                                                                                                                         There is cost sharing in an amount of $165,200 which equals                     28% of the NSF award.",
