 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our goal is to understand the mechanisms by which the                           expression of the maize anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes is                     coordinately induced by the regulatory protein B.  The B gene                   product is required for the steady state accumulation of mRNA                   from several genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes                    (structural genes), and we have recently demonstrated that the                  B gene plays a major role in stimulating the transcription of                   the structural genes.  Transient cotransformation studies using                 plasmids carrying structural gene promoter sequences fused to                   luciferase, and plasmids which produce B protein, demonstrate                   B mediates an approximately 100 fold induction in luciferase                    activity.  The deduced amino acid sequence of the B protein                     (obtained from the cDNA sequence) revealed a myc homologous                     region found in several DNA binding proteins and a negatively                   charged region characteristic of transcriptional activators.                    Both in vitro and in vivo assays will be used to: examine the                   in vivo modification of the B protein and its subcellular                       location and tissue distribution; dissect the regions of the                    B protein necessary for transcriptional control of the                          structural genes; determine the functions of these regions                      (transcriptional activation, DNA binding, protein/protein                       interactions, etc.); assess whether the B protein interacts                     directly with regulatory regions found in the structural genes;                 identify other proteins interacting with B; and investigate if                  B influences anthocyanin biosynthesis at levels in addition to                  transcription of the structural genes.  The maize anthocyanin                   biosynthetic pathway represents one of a small number of                        pathways in higher plants for which regulatory proteins and                     their targets are known.  Thus, studying the mechanisms                         utilized by B should reveal important information regarding                     regulated gene expression in higher plants.",
