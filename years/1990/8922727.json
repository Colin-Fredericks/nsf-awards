 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the proposed work is to develop a                         new approach to detection of incipient faults in rotating                       machines by using artificial neural networks.  Medium                           size induction motors are used as prototypes for rotating                       machines in this project due to their wide application and                      also for economic reasons.  The concept can be easily                           generalized from induction motors to other rotating                             machines.                                                                                                                                                       The design of an artificial neural network to detect                            incipient faults of induction motors is based on the                            steady-state performance of the motor.  However, the                            detection scheme will be applied in real time when the                          motor experience occasional disturbances, and in this                           case, the motor will not always be in steady-state.                             Inappropriate inputs to the fault detector will yield false                     alarms at the fault dector.  An artificial neural network                       will be developed to filter out the transient measurements                      but retain the steady-state measurements and thus feed                          the correct measurement to the fault detector.                                                                                                                  The expected significance of the proposed work will be                          development of an on-line incipient fault detector for                          rotating machines.  The detector is composed of two                             parts: (1) a measurement disturbance filter artificial                          neural network, and (2) an incipient fault detection                            artificial neural network.  The detector will be able to                        detect the common incipient faults of the motor, such as                        turn-to-turn insulation failure and bearing wear, and will                      be robust to disturbances in the motor as well as to                            measurement noise.  Theory will be developed to ensure                          the performance of the networks, including training                             (learning) and recalling schemes under different motor                          operating conditions.  The performance of the                                   disturbance and noise filtering neural network will be                          compared to the conventional noise filtering schemes",
