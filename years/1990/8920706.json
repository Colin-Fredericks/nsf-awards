 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine particulate matter in the stratosphere impedes the                    passage of solar radiation to the earth's surface.  The size,                   shape, and chemical composition of airborne particles determine                 the extent to which different wavelengths of light are                          attenuated by processes of absorption or scattering.                            Therefore, knowledge of the altitude profiles of these                          stratospheric aerosols, of their physical and chemical                          characteristics, and of their spatial and temporal changes, is                  required in any effort to predict their effects on the heat                     balance of the atmosphere, or on warming or cooling effects at                  the earth's surface. As a result of study on the Antarctic                      ozone hole, the role of particles on the chemistry of the                       stratosphere is also being more fully appreciated.                                   Some baseline level of aerosol distribution characterizes                  the undisturbed stratosphere, but volcanic eruptions inject                     gases and ash particles at unpredictable times and places and                   in quite significant amounts.  An assessment of either long-                    term or episodic effects of volcanoes or other natural                          influences requires the acquisition of a long time series of                    observation.  Through the decade of the seventies and up to the                 present, the principal investigators of this grant have                         maintained a regular series of instrumented balloon flights to                  measure the size distributions and altitude profiles of                         stratospheric aerosols.  This observational program has                         provided the only available set of data based on instrumental                   measurements made in the stratosphere.  The instrumented                        balloon system already in place at Laramie, Wyoming, was able                   to characterize aerosols in the plume of El Chichon, a Mexican                  volcano that erupted in 1982.                                                        This project will continue this important record of                        stratospheric particulate with improvements in the size                         resolution of the particles.  The stratospheric aerosol                         presently appears to be at background levels, but in the advent                 of a major volcanic eruption, the project will focus on                         identifying any depletion in ozone associated with                              heterogeneous reactions on the particles.  Measurements at high                 latitude (Kiruna, Sweden), are aimed a determining the particle                 size distribution of polar stratospheric clouds which are                       thought to be instrumental in ozone depletion as observed in                    Antarctica.",
