 "awd_abstract_narration": "Redoubt Volcano, Alaska has been in a state of eruption since                   December 1984.  This exploratory research project is for                        deployment of a portable observatory to obtain badly needed                     ground-truth information.                                                       A unique research opportunity exists at present at Redoubt                      Volcano to learn much about eruptive processes, glacier-volcano                 interaction and interpretation of seismicity at an active                       andesitic volcano.  Most of the needed equipment (Seismographs,                 TV cameras and radios) have already been purchased by AVO and                   W.M. Keck Foundation funds.  Separate funding is available for                  additional equipment, publication charges etc.                                  The building would be located on ice on a 4000' high ridge 14 km                north of the volcano.  It has a double roof for protection                      against possible pumice bombs and researches would dig a bomb                   shelter in the ice for the unlikely event of a very strong                      explosion.                                                                      The seismicity is so high at present that even in a short, e.g.,                10 day, observation window, one could learn a lot about the                     physical processes that cause the great variety of ground                       vibrations.                                                                     The budget is for 1 month of P.I. time, helicopter deployment of                the hut and basic video and photographic equipment.  Additional                 costs for the experiment will be covered by AVO as matching funds               for this NSF Grant.",
