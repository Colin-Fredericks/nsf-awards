 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the improvement of the modern optics                      laboratory component of several courses by introducing current                  instrumentation related to setting up and testing a fiber optics                telecommunications network.  The pedagogical format is that of a                traditional laboratory with a carefully constructed write-up and                prototyping to ensure that students can maximize their learning                 during the available time.  Students construct a \"mini-network\"                 with components capable of handling an FDDI rate of 100 Megabits                per second.  Using commercial bit error rate test sets, students                learn how to measure the bit-error rate for the system.  With a                 wideband oscilloscope they produce an \"eye\" diagram and learn to                interpret its representation of transmission quality.  They also                learn to use optical time domain reflectometers to acquire a                    detailed characterization of the fiber cable, including splice                  losses, connector losses, fiber attenuation, and end reflection                 with high resolution.  They also measure material and modal                     dispersion on commercial optical fiber.  All instruments are                    representative of those that a technician working with fiber optics             would be likely to use.  Much of this is, nevertheless, appropriate             for pre-engineering students.                                                                                                                                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
