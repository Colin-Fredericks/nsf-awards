 "awd_abstract_narration": "Condensation in multispecies systems can be dramatically                        different from single-component condensation in enclosures.                     Variation of species concentration along phase boundaries can                   result in large, nonlinear decreases in condensation rates,                     with strong impacts on the fluid mechanics.  Experiments show                   that semi-stagnant multispecies systems can exhibit complex                     bifurcation behavior and large pressure fluctuations, but only                  approximate modeling techniques are available, even for                         steady-state recirculating conditions.  Here new numerical                      techniques for boundary conditions are being combined with                      laser holography experiments to determine species                               distributions.  In a second area of research, conjugate heat                    transfer effects on nuclear boiling will be investigated under                  conditions of strong convection, as occur in critical flashing                  flows in nozzles, pipes, and cracks.  Conjugate heat transfer                   in the wall material will result in some wall subcooling at                     the temperature inflection point where bubble nucleation                        occurs.  Under conditions where this wall subcooling is large,                  bubble nucleation will be depressed and large liquid                            superheats observed, strongly altering the flow dynamics.                       This new hypothesis provides good correlation of existing                       experimental data over wide superheat ranges, but study of                      heat transfer under high velocity flashing conditions is                        required to permit nonempirical modeling.  A third topic of                     interest is multiphase transport in porous materials.                           Under certain conditions, experiments have shown solute                         leaching and transport are enhanced under unsaturated                           conditions.  Most studies however, particularly for geologic                    repositories for high-level nuclear waste storage, assume                       saturated conditions as \"worst case\" scenarios.  Here research                  is focusing on two and three-dimensional transport in                           unsaturated systems, paying particular attention to the waste                   forms of species affecting leaching rates, ion exchange and                     mass transfer, and coupling between the fluid mechanics and                     temperature, concentration, and pressure fields.                                                                                                                When gas, vapor, liquid, and solid phases coexist, the                          fundamental mechanisms of heat and mass transport can be                        greatly complicated by behavior at phase interfaces.  Often                     the location, thermodynamic state, and heat and mass transport                  across the phase interfaces cannot be modeled or even measured                  experimentally.  These difficulties are being addressed by                      research on three specific topics, with primary application to                  nuclear and conventional energy conversion systems, and                         processing and storage systems for nuclear and chemical                         wastes.",
