 "awd_abstract_narration": "The appearance and interpretation of colors used on maps is a              function not only of how each color looks individually, but also of how         each color is interpreted with respect to the other colors that appear          on the map.  Cartographers and cognitive scientists have developed a            number of models to explain the processes by which people perceive              different sets of colors when displayed together on a map, but those            models have not been well integrated with one another.  This doctoral           dissertation research project will perform two experiments that should          permit a more coherent integration of some of the prevalent models of           color appearance and perception.  In the first experiment, subjects             will be shown different sets of colored polygons and asked to select            which free-standing polygons most closely replicate the colors of               specific polygons.  Measurement of how closely colors selected by               subjects match the actual colors of the specific polygons will provide          a means of calibrating and reconciling two extant models.  In the               second experiment, the combined model refined in the first experiment           will be tested using different color schemes on actual maps, with               subjects again asked to determine which specified areas have similar            colors.                                                                              Although these experiments will provide specific information               regarding how viewers interpret specific color combinations on maps,            the project's primary value will be in providing a realistic test of            general behavioral models, thereby increasing broadly based                     understandings of the ways in which color combinations affect                   cartographic communication.  This project also will provide an                  excellent opportunity for a promising graduate student to expand and            refine her basic research skills.",
