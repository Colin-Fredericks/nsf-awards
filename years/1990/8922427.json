Although recent analytical investigations have led to a better                                                                                                  understanding of the phenomena that govern this limit, these                                                                                                    investigations have resulted in wide variations in the                          predicted level at which entrainment should occur.  In                          contrast to these numerous analytical investigations, very few                                                                                                  experimental investigations have been conducted.  In these,                     entrainment has only been observed in heat pipes where the                      capillary structure was flooded.  No experimental evidence has                                                                                                  been found to indicate entrainment of droplets in properly                      primed heat pipes, suggesting that entrainment may never occur                                                                                                  in heat pipes, due to the presence of the capillary structure                                                                                                   which retards the growth of surface waves.                                                                                                                      It is proposed here to conduct an experimental investigation                                                                                                    of the entrainment in capillary pumped structures, i.e., heat                                                                                                   pipes.  This investigation would build upon the information                     gained from previous work conducted in the Conduction Heat                      Transfer Laboratory at Texas A&M University and would employ a                                                                                                  laser diffraction particle sizing technique and laser Doppler                                                                                                   anemometry to measure the size and velocity distributions of                                                                                                    entrained droplets.  The objective of this investigation would                                                                                                  be to determine the onset of liquid entrainment in capillary                                                                                                    pumped structures as a function of the flooding level and                       axial heat flux.  Several different types of heat pipe wicking                                                                                                  structures would be evaluated to determine the quantity of                      fluid entrained, along with the size and velocity                               distributions of the entrained liquid droplets.  The result of                  this investigation would be a better understanding of liquid                    droplet entrainment in capillary pumped structures such as                      heat pipes and an experimental determination of the amount of                   flooding necessary for entrainment to occur as a function of                                                                                                    the capillary pore size.",
