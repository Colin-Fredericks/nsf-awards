 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a Pb and Nd isotope study of the footwall rocks                 of the Noranda and Matagami volcanogenic massive sulfide                        deposits, which are located in the southern and northern parts,                 respectively of the Abitibi greenstone belt of the Archean                      Superior Province.  These two areas, formed at 2705 Ga and 2725                 Ga respectively, represent the extremes in both lithology and                   initial Pb isotope rations of the Abitibi belt.  The Matagami                   deposits are underlain by a cogenetic tholeiitic suite of                       basalts, subordinate rhyolites, and a large mafic intrusion.  The               Noranda deposits are underlain by basalts-andesites and rhyolites               of calc-alkaline and (subordinate) tholeiitic affinities and a                  large calc-alkaline subvolcanic intrusion.  The Noranda ore has                 the most, and Matagami ores the least radiogenic Pb-isotopic                    ratios in the Abitibi belt.  Approximately 5-8 samples from each                of the key lithologies in each area (at total of 100 analyses)                  will be analyzed for Nd and Pb isotope ratios and parent-daughter               ratios, enabling us to calculate initial ratios.  About 20                      samples will be analyzed for major elements, rare earths, and Hf,               Zr, Nb, Ta, and Y.  Through assessment and comparison of initial                isotope ratios and trace element geochemistry, the study will                   address the following direct problems:  the relationship of the                 footwall rocks to the subvolcanic intrusive, the relationship                   between the felsic and mafic volcanic rocks in the footwall                     sequence, the relationship of the footwall lithologies to the                   ores including the source of metals in these ores, and the origin               of the magmas forming the footwall lithologies.  The actual                     scientific objectives of the study are of broader scope and                     include seeking answers to the following questions.  Why are                    Superior Province volcanogenic massive sulfides so consistently                 associated felsic footwall volcanics?  What is the role of the                  subvolcanic intrusive in the genesis of these ores?  What is the                significance of Pb isotope ratios in Archean VMS ores generally?                Is the Pb in these ores representative of the mantle, of the                    crust, or of a mixture of the two?  What was the tectonic                       environment in which these rocks formed?  Were the magmas forming               the footwall volcanics purely mantle-derived or do they contain a               component of older crust?  How are the isotopic evolution of                    mantle Nd and Pb related?",
