 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the introduction of engineering                  and technology into the liberal art curricula at the                            undergraduate level.  It is intended that liberal arts faculty                  members as well as engineering and technology faculty members be                involved from the inception of the project.  A key workshop is                  organized to study current efforts and concentrate on                           recommendations for future efforts.                                                                                                                             The agenda includes issues in engineering and technology for                    liberal arts majors, discussions of mechanisms to attract a                     critical core of faculty and identify evaluation and measurement                techniques and processes.  Each participant in the workshop is                  expected to discuss their experiences, insights and                             recommendations for enhancing the technological literacy of                     liberal arts majors.  A proceedings which summarizes the major                  aspects of the workshop is developed and distributed.  A project                plan for a full study of technological literacy for liberal arts                majors is generated.",
