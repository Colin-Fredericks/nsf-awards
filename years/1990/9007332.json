 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships                are awards to recent recipients of doctoral degrees in the                      mathematical sciences.  These awards are a means of contributing                to the future vitality of the scientific effort of the nation.                  As researchers in the mathematical sciences expand their                        interactions with other disciplines, and as the interplay                       increases between the various areas of mathematics itself,                      opportunities for postdoctoral research and training are becoming               increasingly important.  The fellowships are designed to permit                 awardees to choose research environments that will have maximal                 impact on their future scientific development.  The fellowship is               designed to provide 24 months of support divided into 18                        academic-year months and 3 periods of two summer months.  The                   recipient may choose (1) the Research Fellowship option which                   allows for full-time support for any 18 academic-year months in a               three-year period, in intervals not shorter than 3 consecutive                  months or (2) the Research Instructorship option which allows the               18 months of academic year support to be taken as 9 months of                   full-time support and 18 months of half-time support.  Not more                 than two months of summer support from this Fellowship may be                   received in any calendar year.                                                       John Rompel will receive his doctoral degree from the                      Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and will pursue research                 in the area of non-standard randomness and computation, under the               guidance of Richard Karp at the International Computer Science                  Institute.",
