 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Osprey spray deposition process is an attractive                            alternative technology to manufacture net or near net shape                     components.  The process entails atomization of a liquid                        stream of metal into a spray of molten droplets which                           subsequently impinge and consolidate on a substrate to                          produce a homogeneous deposit.  The overall objective of                        this research proposal is to predict and control the                            evolution of microstructure during solidification in the                        spray deposition process.  The study will develop a model                       for the microstructure formation during solidification in                       spray, the integrating the interaction of micro- and                            macroscopic solidification events.  Initially, experimental                     and analytical studies will be performed in order to                            quantify the size, number and spatial distribution of the                       generated nuclei.  Concomitantly, the solidification of the                     spray deposit will be modeled, taking into account the                          growth kinetics of dendrite tips and solute balance at the                      scale of the grain size.  Evaluation of the microstructure                      will also be analyzed as particle coarsening during liquid                      phase sintering.  Utilizing the overall model for evolution                     of microstructure from the first phase of the program, the                      study will be extended to design and tailor alloy                               compositions to produce the required microstructures and                        properties in components for specific applications.",
