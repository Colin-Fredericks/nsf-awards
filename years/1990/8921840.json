 "awd_abstract_narration": "The past two decades have seen the development of a large and                   vital literature on repeated games with discounting.  Research in               this area has been stimulated both by a succession of                           theoretical breakthroughs and by a rich variety of economic                     applications that have emerged, notably in industrial                           organization, macroeconomics and international trade.  Until                    recently, the models under study shared the feature of \"perfect                 monitoring\": in each period, a player in the repeated game knows                precisely what actions were taken by other players in all                       previous periods.  Researchers investigating applied problems in                different fields became increasingly dissatisfied with the                      realism of the perfect monitoring assumption and developed models               with special kinds of imperfect monitoring.  The contribution of                this project consists of developing more general and powerful                   models of imperfect monitoring and confronting the methodological               problems that occur in these more realistic models.                                                                                                             Traditional agency theory assumes that the principal has no more                information about the agent's actions than the enforcement                      authorities have.  This project explores various agency                         supergames that modify this standard informational structure.  In               one such model the principal, but not the enforcement agency, can               observe the agent's actions.  Results obtained by assuming that                 the principal can only write one-period contracts are extended to               allow the principal at any time to freely write long-term                       contracts, which offer the agent a salary in every future period                depending on the publicly observed outcomes.  The contracts can                 be renegotiated at the end of every period.  This work provides                 the basis for extending agency theory to a dynamic setting.  Such               a theory requires the analyst to solve problems of loss of                      recursive structure and the negotiation of disequilibrium                       agreements.",
