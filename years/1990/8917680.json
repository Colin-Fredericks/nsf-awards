 "awd_abstract_narration": "On 22 October 1988, Hurricane Joan severely damaged 500,000                hectares of tropical rainforest along the Nicaraguan Atlantic                   coast.  Research in February 1989 indicated that 80% of the trees               were uprooted or snapped and that the canopy was dropped to the                 ground.  Contrary to commonly-held assumptions about forest                     succession after disturbance, no evidence was found of extensive                invasion by pioneer species.  Rather, intensive surveys at two                  locations indicated widespread sprouting from standing trunks, a                recuperating palm understory, and a tree seedling community                     similar to the original forest.                                                 To test a \"direct regeneration\" hypothesis of rainforest recovery               after catastrophic disturbance, a three-year monitoring study                   will be conducted on early events of forest regeneration.  Each                 year, reseachers will identify, mark and measure all trees and                  understory palms and sample tree seedlings in twenty 100 x 10 m                 permanent plots at two different sites; similarly survey two                    undisturbed sites; and census recolonizing bird and bat fauna                   twice yearly.                                                                   There has never been a quantitative assessment of large-scale                   wind damage to mainland, species-rich, lowland rainforests, much                less a detailed study of the recovery process.  This research                   would newly interpret the role of hurricane disturbance in                      structuring Central American Atlantic coast rainforests.",
