In this specific project, interest is                networks of concurrently executing, communicating processes, and                especially in \"dataflow-like\" networks, in which processes communicate          by transmitting \"data values\" over \"channels.\"  They are modeled using          concurrent transition systems, a generalization of ordinary                     nondeterministic transition systems into which concurrency information          has been incorporated in a convenient fashion.  The goal is to classify         such networks by relating their \"transition structure\" to their                 input/output behavior.  This entails search for classes of networks,            defined by axioms imposed on their structure as transition systems, for         which one can obtain simple characterizations of the corresponding              classes of input/output relations.",
