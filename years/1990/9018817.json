 "awd_abstract_narration": "This special minority award will give Ph.D. student Edwin Melendez              additional flexibility in pursuing his graduate studies and                     research in economics.  This award will strengthen minority                     research participation in economics.  More specifically, the grant              will permit Melendez to study the youth labor market in 1988 using              the March 1988 Current Population Survey.                                                                                                                       Melendez will compare the labor force status of Hispanic, black and             white youth across 50 standard metropolitan statistical areas.  The             research will make a significant contribution to our understanding              of the factors that influence the labor supply and employment                   opportunities of black and Hispanic youth.  This is especially                  important because there has been little research on Hispanic youth              employment.  The research will also enhance the the graduate                    training of Melendez by developing and refining his research                    skills.  An important part of the project consists of learning the              necessary computer skills to access the data needed to conduct this             project.",
