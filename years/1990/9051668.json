 "awd_abstract_narration": "The laboratory section of the course in physiological psychology                is being upgraded so that students will experience the research                 methods of modern behavioral neuroscience. The focus is on                      behavioral testing and biopotential recording systems. The                      behavioral testing equipment consists of a 4 station operant                    conditioning system, a figure-8 activity device with                            photoelectric sensing, a radial arm maze, a water maze with                     photoelectric sensing and video monitoring, a rota-rod treadmill,               and a rotometer. The human biopotential recording equipment                     consists of a 24 channel \"Neurosearch\" system for acquiring and                 processing human biopotentials, and an AST 390C computer. The                   animal biopotential equipment consists of a remote telemetry                    system for EEG, EKG, and temperature, and interfaces with the                   computer for data collection. The laboratory experiments using                  this equipment are designed to enable students to explore the                   behavioral consequences of biological manipulations, and directly               observe the physiological activity that accompanies ongoing                     behavior. Students thus gain a better understanding and                         appreciation of the biological bases of all behavior, and are                   better prepared for graduate work in areas related to                           neuroscience. The equipment is also used in independent student                 research projects. The university will contribute an amount equal               to the award.",
