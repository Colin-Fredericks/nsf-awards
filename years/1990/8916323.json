 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for continued studies directed at comprehensive                 field sampling and measurement of volcanic emission products at                 active volcanoes.  It will involve continued multi-method field                 sampling and measurement efforts at two or three field sites in                 the next two years.  The new data and samples will be analyzed                  and interpreted using new thermochemical models which now                       address more than 40 components and over 500 species; these                     models form the basis for understanding the multitude of                        chemical reactions which happen when emission products,                         especially gases, ascend from depth, cool and oxidize in the                    earth's atmosphere.  The PIs will use a new field measurement                   technique, Raman spectroscopy, which can measure emission rates                 of many different species.  Based on experience in air pollution                monitoring, the new Raman technique can measure two or more                     species contemporaneously in real time; this may prove to be                    useful for eruption forecasting.  This work will add to the                     inadequate data base on volcanic emissions, allow for more                      accurate scaling of phenomena of small eruptions, help guide                    models of the impact of volcanism on atmospheric chemistry and                  possibly provide a better understanding of some kinds of ore                    deposits.  This is a collaborative project between William Rose                 of Michigan Technical University and Mark Reed of the University                of Oregon.",
