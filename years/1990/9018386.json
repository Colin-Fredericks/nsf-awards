 "awd_abstract_narration": "The time is ripe for a review of the progress in                           marine chemistry. Ths is particularly true with the advent of                   global change issues. Such issues like the exchange of greenhoue                gases with ocean or availability of trace micro nutrients in                    limiting primary productivity depend fundamentally on the                       physical chemistry of sea water. The American Chemical Society                  has long been a champion of the bright of marine chemistry as a                 new field of applied chemistry. At its 200th annual meeting,                    the ACS has chosen to recognize marine chemistry by holding                     a symposium on Progress in Marine Chemistry. The symposium will                 be sponsored by the Geochemistry Division of ACS and will be held               August 27 and 28 in Washington, DC. The Geochemistry Division                   will also take the opportunity of honoring the contribution of                  Professor Edward D. Goldberg to marine chemistry during his long                and productive career.",
