 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle objective of this project is to support the                       distribution of GENESIS, the GEneral NEural Simulation System                   developed over the last several years in Professor Bower's                      laboratory.  In particular the objective is to establish and                    maintain the necessary hardware, software and personnel to                      support offsite users of the GENESIS system.                                                                                                                    The support of offsite users encompasses several areas.                         First, standard software support will be provided, including                    access to new versions of GENESIS, existing documentation of                    both the simulator and specific simulations developed using                     it, and comprehensive user \"bug\" reports as they are reported.                  In addition to supplying the basic GENESIS system to offsite                    users, Professor Bower and his staff will also provide a                        centralized source through which both bug fixes and extensions                  to the GENESIS platform can be distributed.  They intend also                   to establish a centralized site through which researchers will                  be able to communicate interactively in developing                              simulations.  Finally, due to the modular structure of the                      simulator and its component parts, they will establish a                        central site through which new computationally interesting                      models, simulator graphical tools and basic simulator                           \"elements\" can be shared and distributed by GENESIS users.",
