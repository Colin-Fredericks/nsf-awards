 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teachers and administrators are ready to integrate more                         science-related reading and writing into the curriculum but                     they lack direction.  This project will help teachers make                      connections between hands-on scientific inquiry and science                     related reading and writing.  Year one of the three year                        project will focus on the thought processes employed by                         expert teachers as they attend a summer program on science                      related children's literature and inquiry science, read                         professional publications, plan for instruction, and evaluate                   their own practice.  During the second summer the teachers                      will use information gathered from scientists, authors of                       children's science books, librarians, museum staff, and                         project personnel to create an in-service program which                         focuses on one existing inquiry unit which they have                            modified to incorporate  science reading and writing.  These                    in-service programs, which will seek to teach the process of                    integration as well as the content of hands-on science and                      science-related reading and writing, will be field-tested                       during the 1991-2 academic year.  During the third                              summer, the master teachers will conduct a five-week                            institute to train a second generation of teacher-consultants                   on integrating science across the curriculum.  Materials from                   the project which support this type of inservice and which                      are based on the experiences of the master teachers will be                     then be edited and published by the project staff.  This                        should provide others with an excellent resource which could                    be used in every inservice program designed to encourage                        teachers to use integrated inquiry based hands-on science                       with young children.                                                                                                                                            The cost sharing for the project is 52% of the NSF portion                      of the award.",
