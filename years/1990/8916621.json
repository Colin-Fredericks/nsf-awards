 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing pea cotyledons are sites of synthesis of specific                    reserve proteins.  The synthesis of these proteins is                           developmentally regulated and tissue specific.  Within the                      parenchyma cells of the developing pea cotyledons the reserve                   proteins accumulate in sub-cellular organelles termed protein                   bodies which arise by sub-division of the large central vacuole                 originally present in the cells.  The reserve proteins are                      synthesized on the rough endoplasmic reticulum and pass through                 the Golgi.  This laboratory has established that the transport of               the reserve protein lectin and other vacuolar hydrolases from the               Golgi involves clathrin coated visicles.  To date only limited                  information is available on the biochemistry and function of                    coated vesicles in plant systems.  The proposed research will                   capitalize on the rich source of coated vesicles present in                     developing pea cotyledons to conduct a detailed study of aspects                of their biochemistry and function.  The immediate aims of this                 research are to characterize the clathrin light chain which has                 only recently been identified in plants.  The primary sequences                 of the light chain peptides will be determined and the mechanism                of their interaction with the heavy chain establshed.  Kinase                   activities will be assayed in the coated vesicles from developing               peas to determine whether, in similarity to animal systems, the                 light chain peptide is phosphroylated.                                                                                                                          The results of these studies will contribute to our knowledge of                the biology of plant cells and will enhance our understanding of                the selectivity of intracellular protein transport.",
