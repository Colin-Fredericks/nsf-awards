San Francisco offers a unique opportunity to                                    compare the effects of two earthquakes                                          through detailed and comprehensive                                              observations which now exist for the 1906 and                                   the 1989 earthquakes.  By studying different                                    locations within the city, it is possible to                                    evaluate how variations in fill thickness and                                   density, the thickness and consolidation                                        state of underlying soft clay, the water                                        table, and the depth to bedrock affect the                                      ground surface response and the development                                     of soil liquefaction for similar levels of                                      bedrock seismic motion.  Moreover, ground                                       response coupled with the performance of                                        buried lifeline systems provides an                                             additional chance to quantify the effect of                                     soil-structure interaction on complex                                           networks that are critical for emergency                                        operations.                                                                                                                                                     To take advantage of the knowledge gained                                       from the 1906 and 1989 earthquakes, this                                        project is structured according to a three-                                     fold set of objectives: (1) to characterize                                     subsurface ground conditions and site                                           response at select locations in San Francisco                                   - this requires a comprehensive data base on                                    soil conditions, as well as the familiarity                                     and the site-specific knowledge gained from                                     previous investigations and post-earthquake                                     reconnaissance in the city, (2) to model                                        analytically the site response at select                                        locations, and to compare these analytical                                      results with field observations and with                                        seismic data in order to substantiate and                                       refine the analytical models, and (3) to use                                    analytical models to predict the effects on                                     the city of San Francisco of possible future                                    earthquakes that are larger and closer than                                     was the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                                                                                                                 This project involves cooperation with the                                      U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and San                                           Francisco geotechnical firms and city                                           agencies.  The USGS is performing soil boring                                   at selected locations; geotechnical firms are                                   providing soil boring logs (data) and                                           geotechnical investigation reports in order                                     to expand the available data base on                                            subsurface conditions and relevant soil                                         properties.  In addition, city agencies, such                                   as the San Francisco Fire Department, are                                       involved in evaluating how the site response                                    characteristics might affect the water                                          supply, and how best to design and operate                                      the pipeline system so as to minimize the                                       effects of locally severe ground shaking and                                    liquefaction.",
