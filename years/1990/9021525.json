In addition, we will establish more                     than five residential research  summer institutes that will                     prepare talented minority undergraduates for graduate study                     in mathematics and, ultimately, for academic and                                professional  careers.  Approximately 10,000 minority                           undergraduates will be involved in consortium programs at the                   end of five years.  One thousand of these will be enrolled in                   programs explicitly designed to attract them to advanced                        studies in mathematics.  Professional organizations, in                         particular the Mathematical Association of American, will be                    intimately involved with this project to ensure that the                        advancement of Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans in                       mathematics is established as a legitimate and central                          responsibility of mathematicians and mathematics departments.",
