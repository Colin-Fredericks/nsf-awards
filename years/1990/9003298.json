 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to understand the                        structure and dynamics of supercoiled DNA.  Emphasis will be on                 the determination of the three-dimensional structure of                         supercoiled DNA as a function of linking number; upon the                       prediction of interaction of local segments that are separated by               a considerable distance along the contour length of the DNA; and                upon the elucidation of the effects on DNA structure of wrapping                on a protein surface.  The specific aims are divided into three                 categories.  (1)  Description of the tertiary structure of                      supercoiled DNA using the finite element method.  The finite                    element method from nonlinear structural mechanics will be                      applied to the analysis of closed DNA  structure.  Energy                       minimization criteria will be used to predict the most stable                   configuration at each linking number.  The writhe and twist will                be calculated and the results used to predict the hydrodynamic                  behavior of closed DNA as well as the equilibrium distribution of               topoisomers.  (2)  Description of the generalized helical                       periodicity of supercoiled DNA.  The generalized winding number                 and generalized helical repeat will be defined for supercoiled                  DNA and a formula for the linking number of the DNA developed in                terms of this winding number.  These results will be applied to                 various experiments involving nuclease digestion and chemical                   probes in vitro and phasing in vivo.  (3)  Determination of the                 writhe, the surface twist and the surface linking number for DNA                wrapped on piecewise smooth surfaces.  Writhe and the surface                   twist will be calculated for closed circular DNA wrapped on a                   connected series of proteins of various geometric shapes.  The                  writhe will be analyzed into its piecewise components and into                  the contributions due to pairwise interactions, including those                 between the protein complexes, between the linker regions, and                  between the protein complexes and the linker regions.",
