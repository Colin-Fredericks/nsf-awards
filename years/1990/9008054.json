 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave polarimetric radars (polarimeters) are just now showing               great promise as scientific instruments that are capable of remotely            sensing natural surface and volume targets.  The advantages of                  polarimetry should extend to higher frequencies as millimeter wave              device technology advances.  In particular, millimeter wave                     polarimeters will be useful in sensing the fine millimeter-sized                features of water, ice, and foliated and unfoliated terrain surfaces.           They will also be used to conduct scientific studies of natural volume          targets such as rain, snow and cloud cells.  The University of                  Massachusetts has developed 95 and 225 GHz polarimeters, which it               hopes to use in cooperative research projects with other universities           and government agencies.  This Engineering Research Equipment Grant             provides funds to reconfigure the 95 GHz polarimeter so that it can             accurately measure the scattering behavior of natural surfaces and              atmospheric volume targets.  New antennas, an antenna positioning               system, and equipment needed to develop an appropriate data                     acquisition system are provided, which will be used in a variety of             field measurement programs.",
