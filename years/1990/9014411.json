 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates and evaluates rationales for the use of               pesticide technology in the United States.  On the one hand,                    pesticides are regarded as valuable tools in food production and                in the protection of public heath, yet on the other hand, pesticide             use has given rise to serious concerns relating to both public                  health and the condition of the environment.  In light of these                 concerns, people are calling for a reassessment of the risks and                benefits of pesticide use.  Surveys indicate the possibility of a               significant shift in public values, with demands for cheap and                  cosmetically appealing food conflicting with demands for no                     pesticides.  To evaluate the merits of these apparent conflicts,                it is necessary to obtain factual information from a wide range of              sources and to reassess the value judgments forming the basis for               policy decisions.  This study will attempt to obtain and integrate              information on fourteen diverse topics, ranging from the extent and             economic benefits of pesticide use to the environmental and social              costs of pesticides.  Knowledgeable scientists and scholars will                collect, assess, evaluate and summarize the latest scientific                   information about pesticide use.  They will consider how                        conflicting moral objectives can or should be reconciled; what role             public and private groups and organizations should play in                      determining pesticide policy; and what guidance should inform                   government agencies and regulations about pesticide use.  Findings              will be disseminated at a meeting in Washington, DC, and via a                  summary of the findings and a volume of the collected papers.                                                                                                   This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the principal investigators are excellent.  The             participants are highly qualified and well balanced.  The proposal              and addendum provide adequate information about the activities                  plan, and about the value issues that will be investigated.  The                proposal is recommended for support, with high priority.",
