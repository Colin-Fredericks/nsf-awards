This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Laurence                    T. Baxter to India to work with Dr. Ramesh A. Mashelkar,                        Director of the National Chemical Laboratory \u0131NCL! at Pune on                   \"Transport of Fluid and Macromolecules in Polymeric Gels.\"                      Recently, the NCL has developed super-absorbent polymers,                       i.e., polymers capable of absorbing several hundred times their                 own weight of water or other liquids.  NCL designed one such                    polymer, Jalshakti, to improve the ability of plants to                         obtain water in arid climates.  NCL's polymers have potential                   uses in many areas, such as agriculture, medical and personal                   hygiene products, controlled-release drug delivery, and                         separations.  The researchers plan to model the transport of                    fluid and macromolecules in polymer gels, incorporating                         hydrodynamic and steric effects, as well as the thermodynamic                   properties of the gel.  They will use this model to predict                     macroscopic transport properties, such as diffusivity or                        hydraulic conductivity, as well as concentration and pressure                   profiles, from microscopic properties.  Their goal is to                        relate structure to function, to take thermodynamic parameters                  and incorporate them into a framework to analyze dynamic                        transport effects.  The will test the mathematical model                        experimentally, by measuring effective diffusivity, perme-                      ability, and macromolecular concentration profiles, through                     standard techniques available at NCL.  The investigators                        hope that insight into transport within gels obtained from\u001aa                    verifiable model will yield a rational basis for polymer                        design, and for optimization of system parameters for                           effective drug release or water absorption, or both.                                                                                                            The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
