 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of high population of minority students in the southwestern             United States and the low percentage that pursue higher education, it           is important that educational tools be developed to encourage these             students to pursue and succeed in engineering and science fields.  In           addition to the minority students, many students in this region                 graduate from small, rural schools with poor training for college.              The combination of these students (non-conventional students) have              different problems from traditional students.                                   A solution to this problem is the proposed model environment, which             involves both students at Texas Tech University and area Community              Colleges in meaningful research.  This research interaction and                 mentoring by faculty members will provide an immediate feedback for             the value of math and science, enhancing both the efficiency and                quality of higher education.                                                    The faculty mentoring to students have established records of                   research, such as the Texas Tech Granular Flow Model and the Texas              Tech Wind Erosion Model.  A goal for each student researcher is a               published technical paper.  This work will develop pride and self-              worth for the student.                                                          The Student would be exposed to engineering research principles in the          areas of soil and water conservation, processing of agricultural, food          and industrial products, and development of renewable resources.",
