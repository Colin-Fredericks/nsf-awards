 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is              in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield                  metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  The goal of this               activity is the development of volatile MOCVD reagents for use in               the fabrication of tellurium alloy thin films.  Mercury cadmium                 telluride (MCT) has important potential applications as a material              for passive infrared detectors.  MOCVD of MCT necessitates                      development of new tellurium element source reagents with                       increased volatility and lower growth temperatures.                                                                                                             During the tenure of Phase I research under NSF grant ISI-8860518,              a new class of compounds, trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides, was                 synthesized via a novel ligand exchange reaction.  These compounds              were shown to have a significantly higher volatility and                        comparable decomposition temperatures to the best reagents                      currently available.                                                                                                                                            In this Phase II study, large scale syntheses of these compounds                will be developed and they will be used as Te source reagents for               the growth of CdTe films.  The physical and electrical properties               of the films will be determined.  Simultaneously, further work                  will be done to elucidate the pyrolysis mechanisms of the                       trifluoromethyl(alkyl)tellurides and the mechanism of the ligand                exchange reaction.  This information, combined with the film                    growth studies, should allow determination of the optimum source                reagent and the development of a large scale, high purity                       synthesis of that compound.",
