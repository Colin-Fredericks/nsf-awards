 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will developed the mathematical                 theory of the theoretical/experimental collaboration aimed at                   identifying signal and response mechanisms in immediate allergic                reactions.  Biological cells sense their environment primarily                  through the interaction of cell surface receptors with specific                 extracellular ligands.  These interactions serve as signals,                    initiating cell responses to hormones, neurotransmitters, immune                response mediators, and other molecules.  One response the                      principal investigator and her colleagues will study is the                     release, from intracellular granules, of molecules that cause                   allergic symptoms.  The mathematics proposed here involves                      setting up systems of differential equations, and estimating                    parameters involved in these equations as well as estimating                    distributions using statistical techniques.  The mathematical                   analysis will be necessary to interpret any but the simplest                    experiments.  The combination of solid mathematical modeling and                analysis expertise with the biological experimentation is a                     positive model for interdisciplinary research.",
