 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Richard Brusca of the San Diego Natural History Museum                 is nearing completion of a series of monographs documenting the                 marine isopods of the tropical eastern Pacific.  His current                    project, a study of the genus Rocinela using scanning electron                  microscopy, will bring his analysis of the suborders Valvifera                  and Flabellifera to completion.  Members of this genus are                      parasitic on fishes, and are poorly represented in most museum                  collections.  Dr. Brusca has assembled an unprecedented array of                new samples for study.                                                               The proposed monograph will add significantly to our                       understanding of the evolution and ecology of tropical marine                   organisms.  The completion of this monographic series will have                 implications beyond the concerns of crustacean specialists.                     Marine ecologists will have new and reliable identification                     guides.  Evolutionary and biogeographic studies will use the                    monographs as a basis for studying important processes in an                    oceanographically and historically complex part of the world.",
