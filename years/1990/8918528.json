 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the travel of twelve U.S. participants                  in the \"Third Japan-U.S. Manufacturing Research Exchange,\" to                   be held July 23-27, 1990, in Nisshin, Japan.  The meeting will                  take place under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative                     Science Program.  The central goal of the exchange is to form                   the foundation for a broad-based, continually regenerated                       program of manufacturing research cooperation between the two                   countries.  Specifically, the participants expect to develop                    detailed research programs and forms of cooperation between                     Japanese and American scientists and engineers for a period of                  approximately three years in two areas of interest: (1)                         intelligent manufacturing control and (2) product realization.                  Each side has organized a committee of experts to prepare                       papers in these areas.  For the U.S., the National Research                     Council's Manufacturing Studies Board, through its Committee                    on Research Directions and Needs in U.S. Manufacturing, is                      responsible for organizing participation in the meeting and                     distributing the results of the exchange to the manufacturing                   research community.  This committee is chaired by Dr. Cyril                     M. Pierce, General Manager, Manufacturing and Quality Technology                Department, GE Aircraft Engines.  The Japanese organizer is                     Professor Toshio Sata, Executive Director, Institute of                         Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Wako, Japan.  This will                 be the third in a series of U.S.-Japan meetings, initiated in                   1986, to encourage cooperation between the two countries in                     manufacturing research.  Representatives from both academe and                  industry in each country will attend.",
