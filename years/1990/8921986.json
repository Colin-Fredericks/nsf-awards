 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nickel is known to be at the active site of four distinct types of              metalloenzyes urease, hydrogenase, methyl-coenzyme M reductase and              carbon monoxide oxidoreductase.  How and why nature uses nickel to              catalyze such widely different reactions as the hydrolysis of urea,             the oxidation of H2, the reductive desulfurization of methyl                    thioether, and the interconversion of CO and CO2 are fascinating                questions.  However, at present the coordination environment and                role of nickel in the catalytic mechanisms are not well                         characterized in any of these enzymes.  The objectives of this                  research proposal are the characterization of the structural,                   electronic, and magnetic properties of the Ni centers at the active             sites of hydrogenase, urease, methyl coenzyme-M reductase, and Ni-              substituted Zn enzymes such as liver alcohol dehydrogenase,                     carboxypeptidase and carbonic anhydrase.  The approach is                       spectroscopic involving the combination of absorption, variable-                temperature magnetic and natural circular dichroism, resonance                  Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance studies of the                        metalloenzymes, together with parallel investigations of well-                  characterized Ni-substituted proteins and appropriate synthetic                 complexes.//",
