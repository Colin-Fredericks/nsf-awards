 "awd_abstract_narration": "Common-pool resources are resources, either natural or man-made,                where it is costly to exclude potential beneficiaries from obtaining            benefits from their use.  As a result of the work of numerous                   scholars, many presume that when individuals jointly use such                   resources, each individual is driven by an immutable logic to                   withdraw more of the resource units than is optimal from the                    perspective of all users.  Individuals are presumed to face a tragic            situation in which their individual rationality leads to an outcome             that is not group rational.  There is considerable empirical evidence           not consistent with this presumption.  Building on their prior                  research, the investigators are exploring the extent to which the               presence of suitable institutions allows individuals to escape from             common-pool resource dilemmas, so that these resources survive into             the future and are exploited efficiently.                                                                                                                       The project is multidisciplinary in scope, comprising faculty from              economics and political science.  The project aims to broaden our               understanding of the role of institutions in the survival and                   efficiency of common-pool resources using the techniques of                     institutional analysis and game theory at the theoretical level, and            field case studies, coupled with controlled laboratory experiments,             at the empirical level.  The attempt to rebuild and sharpen existing            theory proceeds with the understanding that the effort must retain              the important theoretical insights already gained, while revising the           theory so that it can be used to generate different predictions in              different institutional settings, which are themselves integrated               into the theory.  Instead of ad hoc explanations for why some common-           pool resources are destroyed and others are not, the investigators              offer a body of theory that tells under what conditions destruction             does or does not take place.",
