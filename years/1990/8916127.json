 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of plant pathogens produce pectolytic enzymes whose                    activity degrades polygalacturonic acid within the host cell wall               during the process of infection.  This pectolytic cell wall                     degradation may contribute to pathogenesis by allowing physical                 penetration of the invading pathogen and perhaps in providing                   monomeric sugars to support energy metabolism of the pathogen.                  Pectic fragments produced through the action of pathogen                        polygalacturonases may, in addition, elicit defense responses in                the infected host.  Plant-derived inhibitors of pathogen                        polygalacturonases have been identified in several plant tissues                and their presence has been shown to be associated with                         resistance to pathogen attack.  It has been proposed that the                   presence of these proteinaceous polygalacturonase inhibitors may                directly inhibit pathogen colonization and indirectly function to               enhance the host defense response.  This research will develop                  the biochemical and molecular genetic basis for critically                      assessing the role of plant inhibitors of pathogen                              polygalacturonases in altering pathogen susceptibility in                       transgenic plants.  The specific objectives are to:  1) purify                  polygalacturonase inhibitors from pear and tomato fruit, 2) raise               antibodies to purified polygalacturonase inhibitors and determine               N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences, 3) construct                      appropriate cDNA libraries from pear and tomato and use antibody                and oligonucleotide probes to isolate cDNA clones encoding pear                 and tomato polygalacturonase inhibitors and, 4) characterize the                polygalacturonase inhibitor cDNAs by sequence analysis and                      patterns of mRNA accumulation.  The results of these studies will               provide the basis for designing strategies of over-expression or                anti-sense depression of the polygalacturonase inhibitor cDNAs in               transgenic plants.                                                                                                                                              Losses of agricultural products to plant pathogens are                          substantial.  While losses can often be controlled through the                  application of fungicides, the enhancement of endogenous plant                  defense systems by molecular genetic means has provided the hope                of reducing the dependence upon chemical control of pathogens.                  The possible role of plant-produced polygalacturonase inhibitors                (PGIs) in pathogen defense is widely recognized but has received                little attention in recent years.  This research will examine the               role of PGIs in pathogen resistance.  If proven effective in                    enhancing plant pathogen resistance, molecular manipulation will                provide a powerful tool for achieving pathogen resistant crops.",
