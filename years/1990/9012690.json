 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award, Dr. Hogan will conduct three experiments in                   observational cosmology.  The first will be a search for cosmic                 deuterium in the absorption spectra of distant quasars.  The                    statistics of quasars are well enough understood to make it                     possible to infer from such data how nucleosynthesis occurred                   during the big bang.                                                                                                                                            The second experiment will be a study with the Very Large Array                 of small scale irregularities in the background radiation.  This                will enable the investigators to put better experimental limits                 on theories of the formation of cosmic structure.                                                                                                               Finally, a long standing search for Lyman-alpha emission from                   galaxies at very high redshift will be continued.  Recent                       advances in technology will permit interesting new limits to be                 placed on processes occurring during the formation of the very                  first galaxies.                                                                                                                                                 Dr. Hogan, a leading young theorist, has been very active in                    designing and performing observations to test critical aspects of               modern cosmological theories.",
