 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although this work will be done on a very simple unicellular                    organism, the protozoan Paramecium, it will examine a very                      basic problem which is common to all animal cells, including                    human ones.  The problem stems from the fact that membranes are                 made up largely by lipids and, therefore, lipid composition                     determines the properties of other membrane constituents, such                  as membrane channels.  Changes in the properties of the                         channels results, in turn, in the imbalance of the ion                          metabolism of cells, an event which ultimately leads to cell                    pathology and death.  Dr. Hennessey has shown that in                           Paramecium there are a number of spontaneous mutations which                    affect the composition of membrane lipids.  Some of these                       mutations result in abnormalities of calcium metabolism.  These                 abnormalities can be \"cured\" by injecting in the mutated                        protozoa droplets of cytoplasm of wild ones.  The objective of                  this research is to find out which particular constituent of                    the injected cytoplasm is effective in curing the defect caused                 by the mutation.",
