 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Rochester Center for Economic                  Reearch at the University of Rochester the help purchase equipment              which will be used to teach quantitative social sciences,                       specifically economics and political science.  Students currently               get little exposure to the quantitative aspects of economics and                political science because of the lack of a centralized facility for             this purpose.  As a result, many do not have a very good idea of                the nature of quantitative research in the social sciences.  The                funds from this award will allow the development of laboratory-                 based undergraduate education in this setting.  Innovative                      classroom applications such as market experiments and model                     simulation, as well as the expansion of traditional applications                in statistics and econometrics will be developed.  This facility                should serve as a model for similar facilities at other                         institutions.  In addition, students will gain a better                         understanding of the nature of quantitative research in the social              sciences, and will therefore be able to make more informed                      decisions about choosing careers in research and/or teaching.  The              grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
