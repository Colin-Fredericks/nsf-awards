 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important aspect of control system design is system                     identification. Once the parameters of the systems are identified,              a controller can be designed to meet a set of design                            specifications. However, when there is a large range of                         uncertainties in an existing system model, a controller added to                a plant would not perform as expected. In this case, an adaptive                control scheme may be used, but using a learning parameter                      identification scheme might yield a better solution. Neural network             techniques seems to offer a powerful solution to this problem.                  Therefore, by using a neural network to learn what the parameters               of a complicated system are, a controller can be designed to keep               a good performance level.                                                       %%%                                                                                  The proposed research project would involve using a neural                 network to identify the parameters of a system so that a better                 controller can be designed. The objective of this research is to                obtain a better estimate of the parameters of any given system.                 After a mathematical model is identified, a controller can be                   designed. The neural network would continually learn about the                  system so that the model obtained will be correct.",
