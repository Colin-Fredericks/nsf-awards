 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Emlet, working at the University of Southern California,                    will address the question of how development and natural                        selection interact during evolution.  He plans to create the                    first integrated developmental and evolutionary model for a                     marine organism, which could provide insights into why some                     organisms have diversified while others have not, as well as                    how environmental changes effect short and long term changes in                 organisms.                                                                                                                                                      Using a sea urchin species as a model organism and techniques                   he developed to infer mode of larval development in fossil                      urchins, Dr. Emlet will determine if the places and times that                  a particular type of larval feeding evolved correspond with                     environmental conditions that are expected to select for this                   type of development.                                                                                                                                            He will also analyze the functional consequences of changes in                  shape and patterns of larval ciliation on swimming performance.                 This experimental work will be the first to determine                           quantitatively the functional requirements for developmental                    processes which are modified during evolutionary changes in                     mode of development.                                                                                                                                            Combining historical and functional approaches may show how and                 when natural selection acts through environmental change or                     functional morphological requirements to control developmental                  patterns.  Historical analyses may also show whether                            developmental patterns influence evolutionary success, measured                 as diversification rate.",
