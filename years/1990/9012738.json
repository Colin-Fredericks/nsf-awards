 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mathematical programming and consensus questions to be                      considered have interested the two principal investigators,                     during their previous research efforts.  Since hierarchical                     classification can be viewed as a problem in mathematical                       programming, the possibility of linearizing in such a way as to                 admit use of Karamarkar's algorithm will be investigated.  The                  consensus questions to be considered arise when one is confronted               with several classifications for the same collection of objects                 and needs to determine the agreement among them.  Much of the                   research which will be undertaken involves Stinebrickner's s-                   consensus method which simultaneously produces a consensus                      classification and an index measuring the degree of agreement.  A               revised s-consensus method has been shown to satisfy three                      minimal and reasonable axioms which describe consensus behavior.                Efforts will focus on the discovery of new methods which produce                a consensus classification and index simultaneously and the                     discovery of new axioms which consensus methods may satisfy.                    Undergraduate students will be trained and collaborate in this                  project.//",
