 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although much attention has focused on the genetic control of                   development in the central nervous system of Drosophila,                        development of the neuromusular system is largely unexplored.                   The proposed research seeks to identify the precursor cells that                differentiate during metamorphosis to form the thoracic muscles                 mediating the escape response.  The large size of metamorphosing                flies, relative to embryos, makes their developing muscles ideal                for physiological testing, anatomical analyses, and surgical                    intervention.                                                                                                                                                   The investigators will follow during metamorphosis the                          differentiation of normal muscle precursors, determine which                    developmental steps are perturbed in mutant flies lacking escape-               response muscles, and identify the function(s) controlled by the                wild-type alleles of the mutant genes.                                                                                                                          To further characterize the action(s) of genetic mutations that                 prevent formation of muscles or cause them to degenerate                        prematurely, the investigators will test whether transplanted                   muscle precursors reverse mutant defects.  Results from these                   experiments should help to determine whether defects in muscles                 or in neurons innervating muscles cause muscle deficiencies.                    This information should enable the investigators in future to                   identify the gene products that are required to complete the                    complex process of muscle formation.",
