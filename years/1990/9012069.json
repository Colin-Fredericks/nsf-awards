 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many animals the brain has some control over its own sensory                 input.  The horseshoe crab, Limulus, provides a rather simple                   visual system demonstrating that what the brain tells the eye                   can influence what the eye tells the brain.  The incoming                       visual information is called the afferent signal, and the                       central regulatory signal to the eye is called the efferent                     signal.  There is a day-night, or circadian, rhythm in the                      brain that transmits efferent nerve impulses to the eyes during                 the night, inducing multiple changes in the retina of the eye                   that produce a million-fold increase in sensitivity of the eye,                 for working in the dark.  This project will use anatomy,                        physiology, behavior, and computational neuroscience approaches                 to study how the retinal rhythms of sensitivity relate to                       changes in the visual system and the animal's behavior.  Long-                  term physiological recordings will be made with precise control                 of efferent signal to the retina.  The retina of this compound                  eye contains about 1000 nerve cells, and is the largest network                 of neurons for which a quantitative description exists.  Its                    properties will be modeled computationally on the massively                     parallel Connection Machine, and the resulting properties will                  be related to the animal's visual behavior, particularly the                    ability to see and respond to the presence of other animals at                  night underwater.  Results from this unique study, from                         molecules to behavior, will have an impact on work in visual                    neuroscience, biological rhythms, efferent control of sensory                   systems, feedback regulation of engineering systems, and on                     understanding more about the neural basis of behavior.",
