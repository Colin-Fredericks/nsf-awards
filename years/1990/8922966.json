 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the origin of the Primate Order is an important               consideration in Biological Anthropology.  In a cladistic                       analysis this is best equated with knowing the \"sister group\" of                the Order Primates.  The sister taxon of primates remains                       unidentified despite numerous analyses based on gross anatomy and               biochemistry.  Most studies have pointed to scandentians (tree                  shrews), dermopterans (flying lemurs), or chiropterans (bats) as                likely candidates.  Recent investigations of structural variation               in tooth enamel have provided insights into the phylogeny of                    several mammalian groups.  In this manner, this study will                      analyze the tooth enamel of primates, tree shrews, flying lemurs,               and bats in order to develop a novel data base to be used in a                  phylogenetic assessment of primate higher-level relationships.                  Developmental and functional components of enamel structure will                be identified.  Analysis of the elements relevant to higher-level               phylogeny will provide a perspective on primate ordinal level                   relationships that is independent of previous interpretations                   based on osteological, gross anatomical and molecular data bases.               This will help in the better understanding of the origin of the                 Primate Order.",
