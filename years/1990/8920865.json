 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference addresses issues on the Synthesis and                           Function of Vitamin K-dependent Proteins.  The conference                       will be held from July 22-27, 1990, at the Vermont Academy,                     Saxtons River, Vermont, under the auspices of the Federation                    of American Societies for Experimental Biology.  The meeting                    will bring together a diverse group of researchers who share                    a common interest; the synthesis or functions of vitamin K-                     dependent proteins. The meeting will be limited to 150                          scientists who will be selected on the basis of their                           ability to actively participate in the exchange of                              information in this area.  The meeting will be focused                          around lectures by invited experts in nine sessions:                            Physiological and chemical properties of vitamin K-dependent                    plasma proteins; properties and synthesis of vitamin K-                         dependent bone proteins; expression of recombinant and                          transgenic vitamin K-dependent proteins; genetic disorders                      and molecular biology of vitamin K-dependent proteins;                          vitamin K epoxide reductase and anticoagulant action; y-                        glutamyl carboxylation and \u001a-aspartyl hydroxylation; new                        vitamin K-dependent proteins; vitamin K nutrition and human                     requirements; and infant and clinical vitamin K nutrition.                      In addition to these scheduled sessions, two or three poster                    sessions will be held which will allow junior investigators                     to present their data.  Although they share a common                            interest, this diverse group of scientists seldom meets                         together, and the meeting will effectively bring them                           together for a stimulating exchange of ideas and                                information.",
