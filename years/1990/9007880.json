 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation project will support the research of a cultural               anthropologist studying the Navajo perceptions and cultural                     understandings of autism.  The student, who has extensive                       experience studying autism in non-Indian society, will determine                whether the Navajo have a concept of an illness syndrome similar                to the one we label \"autism\", and will study how the Navajo                     culture conceptualizes and deals with this form of disease.                     Methods include participant observation in a home for                           \"exceptional\" (i.e., mentally ill) children on the reservation;                 formal interviews and informal discussions with the family of                   children in the home as well as with other Navajo.                                                                                                              This research is important because it will add to our basic core                of knowledge of the cultural variation in the labelling and                     conceptualization of disease.  Such knowledge is essential if we                are to improve the delivery of health care in a multi-cultural                  society.",
