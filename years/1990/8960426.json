 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes the design and testing of a new                         class of amperometric glucose sensors in which electrical                       communication between the flavin redox centers of glucose                       oxidase and an electrode is achieved via a network of                           donor-acceptor relays chemically bound to a poly(ethylene                       oxide), or PEO, backbone.  These polymeric relay systems                        combine several important features found in previous                            polymeric electron transfer relay systems: a) a flexible                        polymer backbone; b) the relays are attached to flexible                        side chains; c) PEO effectively complexes simple cationic                       species, such as potassium and sodium ions, which can give                      the polymer itself some cationic character and increase the                     interaction between the polymer and the negatively charged                      glucose oxidase molecules.  The proposed research plan for                      Phase I concerns the development of this class of sensor                        through the following approach:  a) synthesis and                               electrochemical characterization of several mediator                            (ferrocene) containing PEO materials; b) study of the                           interaction between flavin redox centers of glucose oxidase                     and the PEO-bound electron transfer relay system through                        investigation of these new flexible polymers in enzyme                          electrode configurations; c) covalent attachment of glucose                     oxidase to ferrocene-modified PEO in order to further                           increase the interaction between the enzyme and the                             mediators, to minimize competitive reoxidation of reduced                       glucose oxidase by dissolved oxygen, and to improve the                         long-term stability of the sensor.",
