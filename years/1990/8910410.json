 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to develop and test a process model                   that explains and predicts the maintenance of aggressive mother-                son interactions. The significance of examining the relations                   between attributions and aggressive behavior is that coercive                   mother-child interactions place children, especially boys, at                   risk for exhibiting antisocial behavior in other contexts, even                 into adolescence and adulthood.  The specific aims of this study                are (1) to examine the relations between mothers's and children's               attributions and the coerciveness of their interactions: (2) to                 chronicle stability and change in conflictual mother-son                        interchanges and their social cognitions over one year in order                 to (3) assess the extent to which attributional processes                       contribute toward aggressiveness (coerciveness) and aggressive                  interactions contribute toward mothers' and sons' attributions;                 and (4) assess whether there are particular setting conditions                  (e.g., maternal depression, spousal/ex-spousal conflict, economic               stress) that increase the tendency of some mother-son dyads to                  make negative attributions and engage in coercive interactions.                 Mother-son dyads from married, separated, and divorced families                 will be studied prospectively.  Two assessments (each separated                 by one year) will be made of mothers' and their sons' (7-9 years                of age) attributions and coercive interactions.  The subjects                   will be divided into two cohorts of 100 families each.  Cohort                  assessments are staggered such that replication of findings in                  each wave can be accomplished within 12 months.  In addition,                   assessments will be made of personal-social and socio-ecological                setting conditions that may contribute toward some mother-son                   dyads being particularly vulnerable to making negative                          attributions and engaging in coercive interactions.  This                       research will extend our understanding of the relationship                      between social cognitions, coercive interactions, and ecological                circumstances.",
