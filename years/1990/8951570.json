It is being funded under the Instrumentation and                    Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of                     improving the quality of the undergraduate curriculum by                        supporting projects to develop new or improved instrument-based                 undergraduate laboratory and/or field courses in science,                       mathematics, or engineering.  The purpose of the laboratory will                be to establish a setting where students will confront three                    important components of a mathematical application: (1) the                     reality of the system under study, (2) the mathematical model of                that reality, and (3) the computational algorithms which are used               to relate the two.  Students will be enabled (1) to develop and                 explore mathematical models of a variety of systems which display               fundamental physical and engineering concepts and processes, (2)                to conduct laboratory experiments based on these systems and                    collect data describing the systems' behavior, (3) to analyze the               data using modern computational methods, and (4) to use the                     results of the experiments to explore the validity of their                     models and the algorithms used in their analyses.",
