The project is a pre-engineering program for high school students,              taught by tenured engineering faculty.  In computing, students study            numerical methods, graphics, CAD, and fractals.  They perform six               original experiments on the properties of materials, including the use          of scanning electron microscopy, ultrasonic detection, laser scanning           technology, image processing, and expert systems.  The social context of        technology and engineering careers are also studied.  A follow-up               project is required. Algebra-II and Trigonometry are required.  The             program is located at the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania            State University.  All tuition, room, board, and textbooks are free.            Five stipends of $200 are available, based on need, for travel and lost         earnings.",
