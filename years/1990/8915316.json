 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support ten U.S. participants in a joint U.S.-                  Japan seminar on the subject of high resolution focused ion                     beams (FIB), a field which has developed primarily in the                       United States and Japan.  FIB technology has been applied to                    integrated circuit fabrication, mask repair, and surface                        analysis.   It has potential applications in low-energy                         implantation during molecular beam epitaxy and in nanostructure                 fabrication.  Focused ion beams produced with field-ionization-                 type sources can have large current densities with small beam                   sizes.  Such beams can be used to alter surfaces in a variety                   of ways, including micromachining, implantation, and deposition.                The applications of focused ion beams to integrated circuit                     fabrication include (1) direct, maskless, resistless                            implantation of dopants in Si or GaAs, (2) micromachining or                    ion milling, (3) ion beam lithography, (4) ion-assisted                         etching or deposition, (5) microanalysis, and (6) scanning ion                  microscopy.  Because of the significant technological promise                   of the field, as well as its potential application to the                       study of basic scientific problems in electronic materials,                     the seminar organizers believe the time is opportune for the                    convening of this workshop.  It will bring many of the main                     workers in FIB together to exchange and discuss their recent                    research results and to consider possible joint research                        projects.  The directions of research in FIB technology are                     somewhat different in the U.S. and Japan, and the seminar                       will thus allow workers from complementary areas in the two                     countries to compare results.  Both the U.S. and Japan should                   benefit from such an exchange.  A particular effort will be                     made to ensure attendance by U.S. graduate students.  Though                    there will be some discussion of ion sources and optics at the                  seminar, the emphasis will be on the novel applications                         possible only with high resolution focused ion beams.                                                                                                           The seminar will be held December 3-6, 1990, in Portland,                       Oregon.  Seminar co-organizers are Dr. Jon Orloff, Oregon                       Graduate Institute of Science and Technology, and Dr. Kenji                     Gamo, Department of Electrical Engineering, Osaka University,                   Japan.",
