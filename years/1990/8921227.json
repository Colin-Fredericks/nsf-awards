 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an ambitious effort to investigate state-                of-the-art modeling technology in the context of a practical                    problem with national consequences.  Risk management decisions in               toxicology, health policy, environmental management, and related                fields are often supported by complex mathematical models.  These               models are intended to predict the consequences of each alternative             course of action.  The model predictions depend on values specified             by the potential users.  However, these values are often not known              with certainty.  In failing to reflect uncertainty in parameter                 specification, the models may lead to inappropriate risk management             decisions.                                                                      The investigators propose to apply a set of hierarchical Bayesian               methods to characterize uncertainty in models which predict the                 concentration of synthetic organic chemicals in surface waters.                 The ultimate goal is the creation of an expert system to assist                 users in selecting values of parameters in risk management models.              The general class of problems is an important one, but one that has             only been worked on by a few investigators.  The research team is               well trained and well versed in the relevant analytic tools.  There             is every reason to believe they will complete the project they                  propose successfully.",
