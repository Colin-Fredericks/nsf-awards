 "awd_abstract_narration": "Axoplasm, located in the axons of nerve cells, is composed of                   cytoskeletal and cytosolic proteins which are supplied to the                   axon by a poorly understood process of slow transport.  Since all               proteins exhibit a characteristic of half-life, it is likely that               during slow transport in the axon, proteins undergo significant                 biological decay through degradation.  In order to maintain the                 steady state of protein composition and mass of the axon due to                 significant losses through biological decay, local mechanisms for               the replenishment of proteins are necessary.  This research                     project will examine the localization and distribution of                       selected cytoskeletal protein manufacturing systems and ascertain               what proteins are synthesized locally in the axon.  Although the                evidence available indicates that myelinated axons have a limited               capacity for local synthesis and that local requirements for                    newly synthesized proteins in a short half-life period are                      probably modest, the amount of synthesis occurring over the whole               axon is probably significant.   Experiments will be conducted at                the cellular level on the Mauthner neuron, the M-axon, an                       identifiable cell in the CNS of the goldfish with a large                       myelinated axon extending the length of the spinal cord.  A major               advantage in using the M-axon preparation is that the myelin                    sheath is separated from glial cell bodies, making it possible to               separate the axon from the myelin sheath uncontaminated for the                 analysis of the cell body and the axon.  Specialized methods,                   designed and developed in Dr. Koenig's laboratory, for studying                 ultrapure microscopic samples will be used.  The investigator                   will utilize in situ hybridization techniques to localize                       ribosomal RNA in the M-axon and to assess its density and                       distribution.  Messenger RNAs will be localized in the M-axon for               actin and/or tubulin, important cytoskeletal proteins that are                  supplied to the axon from the cell body by slow transport.                      Analysis of axonal polypeptides synthesized in the M-axon, in an                in vitro preparation, will be performed in order to characterize                which proteins are synthesized locally in the short half-life                   period and to establish that labeled proteins are due to de novo                synthesis.  Proteins synthesized in the M-cell axon in vivo will                be compared with those synthesized in vitro in order to identify                proteins synthesized under physiological conditions, and proteins               with a longer half-life.  The results of this study will address                an important unresolved issue of how the mature axon compensates                for biological decay of its exogenously supplied proteins.",
