 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stuart A. Rice is supported by a grant from The                       Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform both                 theoretical and experimental studies on the interfaces between                  liquids and surfaces of various kinds.  This research is of                     fundamental importance in understanding the way in which liquid                 molecules orient themselves when in contact with a surface.                                                                                                     Rice plans to continue his work on studying liquid surface                      interfaces along the following directions: 1) to study the                      influence of valence and size differences between alloy                         components on the longitudinal and transverse correlation                       functions in liuqid-vapor interfaces; 2) to determine the                       influence of the contact medium on the structure of the metal                   side of a liquid metal-X interface; 3) to perform a theoretical                 study of the anisotropic transport of matter and momentum                       across an inhomogeneous liquid metal-X interface; 4) to perform                 a theoretical analysis of the metal-to-nonmetal transition in                   an inhomogeneous system; 5) to perform both experimental and                    theoretical studies of supported monolayers of long chain                       amphiphile molecules; 6) to perform experimental and                            theoretical studies of the kinetics of phase changes in liquid                  supported monolayers of amphiphile molecules; and 7) to                         determine the dimensions of adsorbed polymer molecules using                    light scattering with incident evanescent radiation.",
