 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand how the amino acid                   sequence of an enzyme encodes its three-dimensional structure,                  and how this structure manifests itself in function.Enzyme                      function and protein structure are both manifestations of                       molecular recognition.  The PI is using the tools of chemistry,                 biochemistry, and molecular biology to determine how molecular                  recognition leads to enzyme action.  The research concentrates on               two facets of molecular recognition: enzyme-substrate recognition               (that is, enzymatic catalysis) and intramolecular protein-protein               recognition (that is, protein folding).  Dr. Reines is focusing                 on catalysis by and folding of ribonuclease A (RNase A).  By                    analyzing in detail the structure and function of mutant RNase                  A's, they are delineating the contribution of particular amino                  acid residues to substrate recognition and turnover and to                      protein folding.  They are also interested in protein disulfide                 isomerase (PDI), which catalyzes the interchange of disulfide                   bonds in other proteins.  They have cloned the cDNA that codes                  for PDI, and are attempting to express it in yeast.  The goal is                to illuminate the mechanism of catalysis by PDI.  A considerable                effort is being made to develop efficient, selective catalysts                  for the synthesis and degradation of complex molecules.  Much                   inspiration for this effort has come from the study of nature's                 catalysts, the enzymes.  Illuminating the molecular interactions                that give rise to substrate binding and turnover may provide the                knowledge necessary to design a protein structure that catalyzes                a specific chemical reaction.  This knowledge, together with the                ability to specify a sequence of amino acids that folds into a                  desired three-dimensional structure, would allow protein                        engineers to create novel catalysts for medicinal analyses and                  therapies, and for industrial processes.",
