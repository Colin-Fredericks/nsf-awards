 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural hydrocarbon emissions from plants, estimated to be                 830 Tg per year globally, play an important role in the                         generation of tropospheric ozone, regulation of daytime OH                      concentration, and are precursors of CO.  However, there are many               uncertainties in regional and global inventories of these                       biogenic compounds.  Much of the uncertainty arises because there               is a lack of precise data relating hydrocarbon emissions to key                 environmental variables that regulate such emissions from                       vegetation.  This is especially true for emissions of isoprene                  (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), the single most abundant hydrocarbon                  emitted from plants.  Many questions can be posed concerning NMHC               emissions, 1. What major NMHC are emitted from plants?  2. What                 environmental variables control NMHC emissions?  3. Do                          environmental stresses increase or decrease NMHC emissions?  4.                 What are the biochemical pathways for biosynthesis of NMHC and                  where is synthesis located in plant cells?  5. Can we develop a                 mechanism based model to explain NMHC emissions from plants?  6.                Why do plants emit NMHC such as isoprene?  The major goal of this               work is to attempt to answer these questions in the case of                     isoprene emission from plants.  Second, the project addresses a                 subset of these question in plants that emit a mixture of NMHC,                 focusing on the simultaneous measurement of isoprene and                        monoterpene emissions from the same leaves.  This will provide                  new details for the environmental control for monoterpene                       emissions. Third, while the above experiments are conducted there               will be simultaneous monitoring of emissions of oxygenated                      hydrocarbons (oxHC),  such as acetone, methanol, ethanol and                    acetaldehyde.  This will provide a framework for understanding                  the physiological and environmental conditions that lead to the                 emission of oxHC from plants.",
