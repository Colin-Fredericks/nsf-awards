 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of the emerging picture of diminishing national                            economic boundaries is the movement of foreign firms, not                       only into presently industrialized countries such as the                        U.S. but into Third World countries as well. This is                            especially true when we look at the movement of Japanese                        and American firms into the same countries, using similar                       workers in highly competitive industries such as                                electronics and auto components. When these firms                               undertake production operations outside of familiar social                      and labor market environment, exciting sociological                             experiments naturally take place as well. These endeavors                       have great potential for teaching both social scientists,                       Third World government officials and the managers and                           owners of these operations much that will surprise them                         about alternative ways of effectively organizing production                     work. This dissertation research will apply the skills of                       two highly and even uniquely qualified individuals (Portes                      and student Koido) to a study of local labor markets,                           internal labor markets and transnational corporations in a                      third world nation.  Of special interest here is a                              comparison of the operations of U.S. and Japanese firms as                      they differently restructure their operations in this                           country. This grant will support the graduate student's                         collection of data in the field, primarily through                              intensive interviews with plant managers and workers                            associated with Japanese and American firms. The faculty PI                     is qualified by extensive research experience to guide                          first rate studies in Third World countries. The doctorial                      student is uniquely qualified to do this study, being                           affluent in English, Japanese and Spanish.",
