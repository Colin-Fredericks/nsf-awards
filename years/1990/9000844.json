 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry and                 Biophysics at ISU to establish an REU Site project which will                   support eight students in a ten-week program in the summer and four             students during the academic year.                                                                                                                              Recruiting for the summer program will be done on a regional basis              with intensive efforts to identify minority and women applicants.               Half of the participants will be selected from outside of the                   university.                                                                                                                                                     In this strongly research-oriented department, undergraduates can               select from a variety of research areas of current interest and                 excitement.  Twelve of the faculty have identified suitable                     projects for undergraduates related to their ongoing research.                  Each student will be under the direct supervision of a faculty                  member.  Their roles will approximate those of beginning graduate               students, with efforts being made to integrate them as effectively              as possible into the research environment of the department.                                                                                                    In addition to laboratory research, students will participate in                a weekly research seminar led by faculty, a science-career                      exploration program, visits to industrial and government research               labs, and social activities organized by graduate students.  REU                participants will present their research findings in a student-led              seminar and will be strongly encouraged to continue their projects              and present results at regional science conferences.",
