 "awd_abstract_narration": "Machine vision technology is an important component of factory                  automation.  At a time when American manufacturing seemingly has                lost its competitive edge and reputation for quality, machine                   vision can provide cost-effective solutions to alleviate these                  problems.  Unfortunately, making this technology work effectively               and reliably on the plant floor has been an unexpectedly difficult              and troublesome task.  Linear-camera based systems can be an                    effective solution for such problems and is the focus of this                   research.  In particular, this work addresses the current                       limitations of linear camera systems to enhance the low-level image             processing capabilities, research into dedicated high-performance               processor for intermediate-level processing and develop suitable                optimized algorithms for linear camera systems.  The selection and              implementation of appropriate hardware elements are made with the               realization that programming is usually a very significant part of              the overall cost of application development.",
