 "awd_abstract_narration": "The West Irondequoit Central School District of Rochester, New                  York is conducting a Private Sector Partnership project to                      Improve Science and Mathematics Education in West Irondequoit                   Schools.  The project aims to motivate junior and senior high                   school students to choose technical careers in industry and                     manufacturing.                                                                                                                                                  The initial target group is 500 seventh and eighth grade                        students; 30% of these students are minority, 50% are female,and                12% are handicapped.  They are introduced to technology education               through the Manufacturing Technology Awareness Module (TAM).  TAM               will allow the students to explore such concepts as CAD/CAM, use                of robots in industry, applications of computers, and creative                  problem solving.  Students will be impressed with the necessity                 of integrated study of math, science, and technology for solving                technical problems.",
