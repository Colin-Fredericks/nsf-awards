A common theme to all of the research                 programs is the regulation of N use efficiency.  An overview of                 the objectives of each program are 1) to quantify and better                    understand N transformations in soil, particularly N losses, 2)                 to understand the fundamental processes of inorganic N transport,               N metabolism, and N fluxes controlling plant N use efficiency,                  and 3) to develop the underlying basic principles regulating N                  cycling and metabolism in the efficient conversion of dietary                   protein of ruminants.  Specific research areas includes;                        regulation of denitrification and N immobilization as related to                soil environment and soil management, ecology of soil bacterial                 involved in N transformations, fate of organic and inorganic N                  sources in agricultural soils, factors controlling adjustments in               N uptake and altered partitioning of reduced N in N limited                     plants, roles of plant sink and source strength on allocation of                N, and effects of endogenous proteins and blood urea-N inputs to                the rumen N pool on dietary protein use.  A MS designed for                     stable isotope ratio analysis, the preferred method of 15N                      analysis, would directly benefit and further enhance the                        individual and collaborative programs of the principal                          investigators and stimulate the research endeavors of other                     scientists.",
