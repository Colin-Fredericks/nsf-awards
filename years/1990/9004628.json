This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support research projects by                D. Griffeath, J. T. Cox, and R. Durrett in the Departments of                   Mathematics of the University of Wisconsin, the University of                   Syracuse, and Cornell University, respectively.  At least two of                the three investigators will work on the following five projects:               nonlinear voter models, anti-stepping stone models, forest fires                and epidemics, cyclic wave dynamics, and growth models on Poisson               lattices.",
