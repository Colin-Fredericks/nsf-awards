 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central question in biology is the regulation of the expression               of cellular genes by the environmental signals a cell receives.                                                                                                 This signal-response process is the basis for many biological                   functions including cell differentiation, cell proliferation as                 well as the formation of long term memory.                                                                                                                      A recent advancement in the understanding of this signal-response               process is the recognition that activators of the cyclic AMP-                   dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C can regulate gene                 expression.  Because protein kinases are in general regulated by                second messengers, which are synthesized in response to                         environmental signals, the demonstration of a connection between                protein kinases and gene expression provides clues to a better                  understanding of this signal-response process.  The goal of this                proposal is to understand in particular the role of a tyrosine-                 specific protein kinase in the regulation of gene expression.  A                system has been developed using temperature sensitive mutants of                the v-abl tyrosine kinase to examine the mechanism of regulation                of gene expression.  A strategy has been out to clone genes that                are regulated by the v-abl tyrosine kinase, and we have                         identified at least one cellular gene whose expression can be                   induced by the v-abl tyrosone kinase.  Experiments will be                      performed to determines the site of action of the v-abl tyrosine                kinase and to elucidate the pathway linking this kinase to the                  expression of cellular genes.  This research will shed light on                 the mechanism by which the v-abl tyrosine kinase regulates gene                 expression and it will contribute to the understanding of a                     central biological signal-response process.",
