 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Professor John D. McGervey, Department of                Physics, Case Western Reserve University, and U.S. colleagues to                collaborate with Professor Yusuke Ujihira, Engineering Research                 Institute, The University of Tokyo, and other Japanese researchers              in a study of polymers by the technique of positron annihilation.               The basis of this technique is the fact that the lifetime of a                  positron in a variety of materials has been found to be dependent               upon the electron density in its surroundings.  In regions of                   relatively low electron density--in holes or defects in a solid,                for example--the lifetime is measurably longer (though still                    measured in trillionths of a second) than in other, higher density              regions.  The lifetime is measured by observing the gamma ray which             signals the creation of a positron, followed by a second gamma ray              which appears when the positron is annihilated.  In polymers, the               longer lifetime is thought to be the result of the formation of an              \"atom\" of ortho-positronium (o-Ps), which is more stable toward                 annihilation by an electron than is a positron itself.  The                     lifetime of positronium is thus a measure of the size of the free-              volume element (\"hole\") in which it finds itself.  In the case of               polymers the o-Ps appears to be formed or trapped in the free-                  volume elements that exist between the strands of polymer molecules.            The greater the number and volume of such elements, the greater is              the probability of forming o-Ps.  From the measured positron                    lifetime distribution in a polymer sample it is possible to partially           characterize the sample in terms of the size distribution of its                free-volume elements.  Such information is useful in studies aimed              at understanding the relationship between free volume and such                  polymer properties as viscosity, elasticity, and gas permeability;              the change (decrease) in free volume with polymer aging; and the                response of polymers to variables such as temperature and pressure.                                                                                             The cooperating scientists have had considerable experience in the              positron lifetime technique.  In this cooperative effort they plan              to pursue further its application to polymer studies by developing              standardized methods for sample preparation and characterization,               as well as procedures for dealing with possible sources of systematic           error.  The technique will be applied to various polymers, including            some that may be used in advanced engineering plastics.",
