 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Alan M. Portis of the University of               California at Berkeley for collaborative research on high temperature           superconductivity with Professor Helmut Piel, Department of                     Physics, University of Wuppertal.  They share an interest in the                development of high quality films and coatings of high temperature              superconductors for a variety of applications including particle                accelerator cavities operating at microwave frequency.  The quality             of these materials deteriorates at high microwave power levels.                 Together with Dr. D. W. Cooke of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,            they are developing a detailed theoretical model of microwave flux              penetration and surface resistance and are also undertaking careful             measurements of both phenomena.  The development of microwave                   cavities for particle accelerators has largely been led by Dr. Piel             and his students.  There is no comparable experience anywhere else.             Dr. Portis brings to the collaboration outstanding expertise in the             microwave properties of high temperature superconductors.  Their goal           is to identify the loss processes and to work for their elimination,            so as to obtain materials that maintain their quality at high                   microwave power levels.                                                                                                                                         Verification of a microwave critical state in superconductors would             have important scientific and technological benefits.  It would                 indicate that microwave processes in superconductors are much                   faster than has been thought possible, requiring reexamination of               some of our ideas of flux penetration into type II superconductors.             It would also improve surface quality at high power by identifying              the origin of the observed power dependence in surface resistance in            high temperature superconductors.  If the loss mechanism does                   persist into the microwave frequency range, there may well be                   opportunities for using these materials for high frequency signal-              processing.  Thus a mechanism that creates a problem for particle               accelerators may provide opportunities in an entirely different                 domain.",
