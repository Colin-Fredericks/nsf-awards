 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in combinatorics of                       Professor Jeffry Kahn of Rutgers University. Dr. Kahn will be                   conducting investigations in the following topics: the properties               of hypergraphs (collections of finite sets); the problem of                     giving a good estimate of the probability that a random square                  matrix of order n, in which all entries are zero or 1, should be                singular; and Chvatal's conjecture on intersecting families in                  ideals in finite Boolean algebras.                                                   This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
