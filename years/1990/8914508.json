 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Christopher B. Field of Carnegie              Institute of Washington and Professor Robert W. Pearcy of the                   University of California at Davis in a research collaboration with              Professor Carlos Vasquez-Yanes of the Universidad Nacional                      Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM).  The researchers intend to carry out                 experiments on 2 important but poorly understood aspects of the                 ecology of rainforest plants in the plant genus Piper, growing in               the \"Los Tuxtlas\" biological preserve, in Veracruz, Mexico.  The                experiments are multi-species comparisons utilizing Piper species               native to habitats of contrasting light availability.  One group of             experiments focuses on the physiological ecology of plants at the               young seedling stage, a stage characterized by high mortality, but              about which little is known.  On plants less than a few months old              and less than 10 cm tall, they intend to study the functional                   determinants of growth rate, including biomass allocation, mineral              nutrition, photosynthesis, and tissue construction costs.  The                  other group of experiments explores photosynthesis and transpiration            in fluctuating light.  Variation in the efficiency of utilizing                 fluctuating light is known to have important consequences for                   carbon balance for several species.  The utilization of fluctuating             light has not been studied in a system where other functional                   determinants of growth are as well understood as in the genus Piper.                                                                                            The proposed research will continue to develop the genus Piper as               a model system for understanding the mechanisms controlling the                 distributions of tropical rainforest plants.  Much of the                       infrastructure for the collaboration is already established, as a               result of long-standing formal and informal interactions among the              principal investigators in both countries.  The emphasis on a                   widely studied model system should yield high returns because many              questions in ecology can be answered only through the integration               of information concerning multiple aspects of an organism's                     biology.",
