Merritt of the Chemistry Department at Wellesley College will                   determine the rate constants for oxygen exchange for  isomers                   as a function of racemization of a series of chiral alcohols.                   These detailed kinetic studies will enhance the understanding                   of reaction mechanisms and reaction intermediates in these and                  related systems.                                                                                                                                                The rate constants for oxygen exchange as a function of                         racemization of a series of chiral alcohols will be used to                     probe the structural features that lead to asymmetric solvation                 of carbocation intermediates and to investigate the structure                   of water within the solvation sphere.  The mechanistic                          conclusions will be based on the microscopic rate constants for                 three competing processes at the alpha carbon atom and the                      oxygen isotope effects for these processes.  The three                          competing processes being studied are substitution (O-18                        exchange) without inversion, substitution (O-18 exchange) with                  retention, and inversion without substitution.",
