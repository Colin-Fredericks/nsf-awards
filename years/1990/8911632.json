 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies from this laboratory have established that                       hydrogen tunneling occurs in the yeast alcohol dehydrogenase and                bovine serum amine oxidase reactions.  These initial findings                   suggest that room temperature tunneling may be fundamental                      feature of enzyme catatlyzed hydrogen transfer reactions.                       Investigation will be extended in order to:                                      (i)  Determine the generality of hydrogen tunneling in enzyme                  catalyzed H:, H. and H+ reactions, thereby establishing a data                  base for such behavior;                                                          (ii) Characterize the parameters which are likely to control the               probability of tunneling, in particular the roles of reaction                   driving force, E.S binding interactions and protein motion; and                  (iii) Initiate computational work, with the goal of                            discriminating among possible models for nuclear tunneling at                   enzyme active sites.  Ultimately, such studies are expected to                  provide insight into the shape of reaction coordinates at enzyme                active sites.                                                                                                                                                   Over the past few years the role of quantum mechanical effects in               enzyme reactions have gained importance.  Although the area of                  electron tunneling has been the focus of extensive on going                     investigatrions the phenomenon of hydrogen tunneling in biology                 has received relatively little attention.  It is a particular                   promising area to pursue to find answer too many features of                    enzyme catalysis.",
