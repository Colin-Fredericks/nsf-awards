 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in sociology                     on the topic of comparative U.S. and British civic response                     to child sexual abuse.  The investigators are Dr. Thomas                        Frothingham, Duke University Medical Center and Dr. C.J.                        Hobb, St. James University Hospital, Leeds, England.                                                                                                            In the county of Cleveland, England in 1987, diagnoses of                       child sexual abuse increased suddenly, and within a few                         months, more than 100 children were removed from their                          homes.  Public outcry and Parliamentary inquiry resulted in                     an extensive national examination of all the arrangements for                   dealing with child abuse in England.  There are striking                        parallels between what has happened suddenly in England and                     more gradually in Durham, North Carolina and other areas in                     the U.S.  Change in civic response in the U.S. is urgently                      needed but is proceeding slowly at best. In this project, Dr.                   Frothingham proposes to study in collaboration with Dr. Hobb                    the changes now occurring in England in the aftermath of the                    Cleveland experience.  Specifically, the following will be                      examined:  1) arrangements for the detection and management                     of sexually abused children and their families  2) intra-                       agency structure and function, i.e. medical organizations,                      social services, police, judiciary and private agencies.  3)                    inter-agency collaboration and 3) the effect of the Cleveland                   experience on current practices and recent changes.  The                        proposed research project is a significant opportunity to                       gather data on a critical social problem in the U.S.  Since                     England provides wide range of social supports not available                    to any but the poorest sector in the U.S., the cross-cultural                   data will be especially valuable.The results of this research                   will provide a greater understanding of the linkages between                    the detection and handling of child abuse and the promotion                     of family stability.",
