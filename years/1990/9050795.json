 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was designed to introduce the use of the Fourier                   transform infrared technique into all levels of the chemistry                   program at the institution .  Through the project, a Fourier                    transform Infrared Spectrometer was purchased and is used for the               identification, analysis, kinetics, and the teaching of molecular               dynamics.   The system introduces students to the use of computer               integrated instrumentation, database searching, and computer-                   assisted data manipulation.  A number of new experiments have                   been included in junior and senior level laboratory courses.                    FTIR has improved the content of laboratory courses in General                  Chemistry as well as in Organic, Analytical, Physical, and                      Biochemistry.  It has made possible the integration of Physical                 Chemistry with Instrumental Analysis.  In addition, it has                      complemented ongoing research projects and opened up new avenues                of research at time when the department was encouraging                         independent study by juniors and seniors.  The acquisition of the               instrumentation is helping the department meet its goals of                     requiring independent research for all undergraduate chemistry                  majors, and reaccreditation by the American Chemical Society.                                                                                                   The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
