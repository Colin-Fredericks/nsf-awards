 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ways in which human activities are altering natural and                physical processes of environmental change and the impacts of that              change on humans are not evenly distributed across the globe.  Because          of special combinations of human and natural attributes, some locales           are especially prone toward accelerated processes of change induced by          human-environmental interactions.  This project will continue the               establishment of a methodological framework for the systematic,                 comparative study of human-environmental interactions in nine parts of          the world where the situation has been assessed as especially critical:         (1) South Florida, (2) the Mexico Basin, (3) part of the Amazon basin,          (4) the North Sea, (5) the Kenya Dry Hills, (6) the Aral Sea, (7) the           Himalayas of Nepal, (8) the Ordos Plateau of China, and (9) the                 Sundaland Rainforest of Indonesia.  Case studies are being undertaken           by scholars familiar with each of these locales to identify and                 evaluate the human forces that are altering natural processes of                environmental change, the growing societal awareness of these impacts,          and the nature of societal responses to those changes.  Common research         approaches are being used in all case studies to ensure comparability           of results.  The work is coordinated by a central research team of              scholars with complementary skills and by an international board of             advisors.  The research also will be coordinated with related                   activities of study groups of the International Geographic Union.                    This research continues to lay the groundwork for an important             series of intensive, comparative case studies of human-environmental            interaction in five critical parts of the world.  The research                  ultimately will provide significant new insights about human and                natural processes in the study areas themselves, but more importantly,          it will provide generalizable knowledge about global patterns and               processes of human impacts on and responses to natural environmental            change.  The study will also establish a framework for replication in           other locales in order to further increase understandings about this            critical topic.",
