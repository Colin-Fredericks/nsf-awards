Although the                      primary thrust is on proteins and latex spheres, the results                                                                                                    should be of more general applicability.  The adsorption of                     many proteins is essentially irreversible, i.e. there is not                                                                                                    desorption or surface diffusion.  The situation is needed                       using the Random Sequential Adsorption (RSA) process.  It is                                                                                                    proposed to calculate the rate of adsorption, saturation                        coverage, and the structure of the film for several well                        defined models using computer simulation.  The results of this                                                                                                  study will assist in the design of processes to manufacture                     thin films with certain desired properties.",
