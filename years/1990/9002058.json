 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the genetic mechanisms controlling developmental                     commitments during embryogenesis are among the most active and                  significant in biomedical research.  The powerful methodological                approaches possible with Drosophila have shown that clusters of                 homeotic genes function to establish developmental fate.  Recent                exciting results indicate that mammals have genes with recognizable             homology which are expressed in domains paralleling those of the                insect homeotic genes.  Although the further developmental and                  molecular characterization of these mammalian genes is a                        fascinating prospect, progress towards understanding their precise              roles will ultimately be limited by the difficulty of isolating and             studying mutations.  The proposed project will focus on the                     homeotic genes of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castenum), an                 insect offering the possibility of integrated genetic,                          developmental and molecular studies with a resolution similar to                that possible with Drosophila, but which is evolutionarily well                 diverged from flies and shows many interesting differences.                     Available balancers and deficiencies will allow the identification              by saturation mutagenesis of the developmentally significant genes              in the portion of the single homeotic complex of Tribolium                      corresponding to the Drosophila ANT-C, and their mutant syndromes               will be described.  Portions of several homeotic genes have already             been molecularly cloned from a genomic library, and embryonic cDNA              and genomic YAC libraries will also be screened.  After these                   experiments have isolated the remaining genes and correlated them               with the genetic map, further studies will determine their                      organization as well as spatial and temporal patterns of                        expression.  Such an integrated approach will enable studies of the             interactions of these homeotic genes with one another and with                  genes up and downstream in this developmental pathway.  Even in a               research area as active as the evolution and function of homeotic               genes, the methodological advantages of Tribolium will generate                 unique insights into the regulation of developmental fate.",
