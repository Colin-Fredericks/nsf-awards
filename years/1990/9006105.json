 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Ronald C.                            Phillips, Professor of Biology, Seattle Pacific University,                     to pursue with Dr. Hilconida P. Calumpong, Director, and                        Ms. Janet Estacion, Marine Laboratory, Silliman University,                     Republic of the Philippines, for a period of 24 months, a                       program of cooperative research to assess the adaptive                          tolerances, growth rates, morphometric responses, and                           transplant success of 5 species of Philippine seagrasses in                     a variety of nearshore coastal environments.  Reciprocal                        and common garden transplants of seagrasses across                              gradients of water depth, water salinity, substrate                             textures, and seagrass species compositions will be                             conducted.  Monitoring of these experiments to determine                        areal extent of the initial planting unit, changes in leaf                      width, mean number of leaves/shoots, leaf area index,                           reproductive phenology, and chlorophyll content will be                         conducted monthly for two years.  In addition, laboratory                       experiments will be conducted on all 5 species of                               seagrasses to assess ranges of heat and cold tolerances                         from donor sites, as well as from control, common, and                          reciprocal transplant gardens.  Data from these experiments                     should allow the researchers to predict the effects of                          human activity and natural phenomena on Philippine                              seagrasses and to initiate effective mitigation along                           coastlines that have become adversely impacted.                                                                                                                 Seagrass communities in the Philippines serve as habitats                       and breeding grounds for various marine organisms that are                      economically important to the local people.  About 60% of                       the Filipinos' protein intake consists of fish and                              shellfish, much of which comes from seagrass meadows.                           Continuing increased activity (dredging, untreated sewage,                      industrial waste disposal, etc.) in the shallow coastal                         environment has impaired, reduced, and even decimated large                     portions of locally established seagrass stocks.                                Hopefully, the present project will contribute to a program                     of marine conservation and coastal management in the                            Philippines and reduce that country's dependence on foreign                     assistance.  The collaborators are highly respected                             scientists in the field of this research.  They will be                         assisted by Dr. Ernani G. Menez, Smithsonian Institution,                       who will serve as consultant.  The present project will                         allow these scientists to combine their talents and                             interests for mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to                      the objectives of the Science in Developing Countries                           Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation                        between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                 counterparts in developing countries through the exchange                       of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques                        and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
