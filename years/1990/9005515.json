 "awd_abstract_narration": "At fertilization, sperm and egg membranes fuse to deliver the                   paternal genome into the interior of the egg, and the egg begins                development. The molecular mechanisms by which the membranes                    fuse and the sperm activates the egg are not well understood.                   This project will test the hypothesis that the portion of the                   sperm membrane that first contacts the egg contains molecules                   that mediate membrane fusion and egg activation. In starfish,                   this portion of the membrane covers the acrosomal process (AP).                 The objectives of this project are to isolate starfish APs, and                 to identify proteins that are unique to the AP membrane and are                 therefore potential bearers of fusion or agonist activities. The                membrane proteins will be characterized by polyacrylamide gel                   electrophoresis and by surface labeling. The ability of the                     isolated APs to activate and/or fuse with denuded eggs, and to                  fuse with phospholipid vesicles will be tested.                                 %%%                                                                             This work will serve as a foundation for efforts to identify and                isolate the sperm molecules that first act on the egg, and will                 increase our knowledge of the general mechanisms of membrane                    fusion and signal transduction.",
