 "awd_abstract_narration": "Logic programming is usually taken to be synonymous with relational             programming.  Two important criteria for a broader logic programming            language are its ability to avoid extra-logical features, such as cut,          assert, retract, etc., and its amenability to efficient compilation.            The broader basis consists of three logical forms:  equations,                  relations, and subset assertions, along with an accompanying set of             matching and unification operations.  Equations provide the ability to          define deterministic operations without Prolog's cut.  Subset                   assertions can be used to define more declaratively Prolog's setof as           well as transitive-closure operations, both of which are traditionally          expressed using assert and retract.  To demonstrate that this broader           framework is practical, further studies will be made in (1) better              integrating the three logical forms, (2) developing an efficient                implementation, (3) carrying out substantial applications, and (4)              examining useful extensions and variations.",
