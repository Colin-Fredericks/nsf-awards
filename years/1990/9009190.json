 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent reports of large nitrate exports from forests to                    surface waters raise concern that losses of nitrate, together                   with associated acidity and cations, may result in gradual                      decrease in forest soil fertility and impoverishment of aquatic                 ecosystems downstream of forested catchments through                            eutrophication and acidification.  Field experiments will be                    conducted to: 1) quantify and compare nitrate retention                         capacities of several different forest ecosystems in the                        Northeast; 2) compare the importances of nitrate uptake by                      growing vegetation vs. nitrate immobilization in decomposing                    organic matter as sinks for excess nitrate; and 3) relate tree                  species growth rates and N use efficiencies to both nitrate and                 ammonium availabilities.                                                             The work will take advantage of two on-going research                      projects.  One is the EPA's Watershed Manipulation Project (WMP),               a large multiple-investigator study of the effects of nitric and                sulfuric acid deposition on soil biogeochemical processes and                   soil solution chemistry at both plot and catchment levels in a                  mixed-species forest in Maine.  The other is a plot-level N                     enrichment experiment conducted at the Harvard Forest NSF-LTER                  site in Massachusetts where investigators are now studying the                  effects of chronic N additions on N cycling rates, primary                      productivity, and canopy chemistry.  The in-place, EPA project                  provides a unique opportunity to trace the paths and to identify                the fate of nitrate additions to forest ecosystems.  This project               will support N isotope studies that will allow for this.                        Preliminary 15N analysis of soils and tissues from the WMP plots                show that the high sensitivity of techniques proposed here will                 allow for quantifying nitrate retention in important ecosystem                  components.                                                                          This research will improve our basic understanding of                      forest ecosystem processes that are important in controlling                    exports of nitrate and acidity to stream, lake, and estuarine                   ecosystems.  It will also improve our ability to predict changes                in forest productivity as patterns and rates of N cycling change                due to both natural processes and human caused N deposition.",
