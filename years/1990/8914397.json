 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award will support a graduate student                in anthropology to study the movement of the \"pink collar\" sector               of the information processing industry from urban centers in the                U.S. to off-shore regions of the Caribbean, and the impact of                   these shifts on Barbadian women incorporated as data processors                 and North American workers who face possible job losses.  Methods               include participant observation and structured interviewing, in                 Barbados and in the US, of executives in the data processing                    firms, political leaders, and workers.  Data form a sample of 50                Barbadian women will be compared to a comparable number of US                   data processors with respect to their life-and work-histories.                                                                                                  This research is important because the restructuring of AMerican                industry is a significant fact of modern life, and studies which                shed light on what this means for workers on both sides of the                  fence -- the developing countries receiving jobs from the US and                the American workers facing changed labor markets -- can help                   inform social policy aimed at ameliorating social problems.",
