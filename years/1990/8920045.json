 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this renewal of a three-year U.S.-Yugoslav cooperative research              project in flourine chemistry between Boris Zemva, Josef Stefan                 Institute, and Neil Bartlett, University of California, Berkeley,               the investigators propose to further their general method for the               synthesis of polymeric binary flourides (metal compounds containing             flouride) developed during the prior joint research program.                    Through these studies, the investigators will apply their                       methodology and characterize and prepare binary flourides.  The                 Yugoslav group is acknowledged by flourine chemists worldwide for               their first-class research and the U.S. investigator, who enjoys an             illustrious career, is noted for his initial discovery of nobel gas             chemistry.  Their joint research and complementary expertise and                interests will yield new insights into the structure of binary                  flourine compounds, which could be applied, for example, to the                 area of hazardous waste treatment.  This grant allows them to                   continue a highly productive 17-year collaboration.                                                                                                             U.S.-Yugoslav Joint Board on Cooperation in Science and Technology              is supported through a joint fund consisting of matching                        contriubutions from the governments of the United States and                    Yugoslavia.  The U.S. contribution is provided annually by the                  Department of State.  No NSF funds are involved.  Grants are made               to the principal scientific institution in Yugoslavia, but include              dollar funds for U.S. scientists' travel to Yugoslavia and for                  Yugoslav scientists' living expenses in the U.S.",
