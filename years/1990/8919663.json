 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a combined airborne radar and                           aeromagnetic survey of two 220 x 330 km regions between the                     Transantarctica Mountains and Marie Byrd Land during the 1990-91                and 1991-92 field seasons.  These efforts will address                          significant problems identified in the Ross Transect Zone (RTZ)                 by the National Academy of Sciences (1986) report \"Antarctic                    Solid Earth Sciences Research,\" and by the report to NSF \"A Plan                for a United States Program to Study the Structure and Evolution                of the Antarctic Lithosphere (SEAL).\"                                                                                                                           The surveys will be flown using the NSF/TUD radar and an                        areomagnetics system mounted in a light aircraft.  The grid                     spacing will be 5 km and navigation will be by radiopositioning.                In addition to maps of subglacial topography and magnetic                       intensity, attempts will be made to reconstruct the position of                 subglacial diffractors in three dimensions.  This reconstruction                should give new information about the distribution of escarpments               and therefore the tectonic relationships within the region,                     especially when combined with the magnetic results.  These                      experiments will be conducted by the Byrd Polar Research Center                 of the Ohio State University and the Water Resources and                        Geological Divisions of the U.S. Geological Survey.",
