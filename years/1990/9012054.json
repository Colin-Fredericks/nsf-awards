 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been hypothesized that pelagically-spawning coral reef                   fishes select spawning sites and times that lead to eggs being                  rapidly removed from reefs. This hypothesis is currently being                  tested by determining the fate of eggs spawned by a reef fish.                  One program component of this research is the dynamical                         modelling of current flow, which is necessary to understand                     forces affecting dispersal and to which fish may be responding                  in their selection of spawning sites and times, and for                         developing predictions of egg transport and potential                           predation. Data collected during simulated-spawning experiments                 has not been sufficient for this task.  This award will support                 this research program through the acquistion of a WeatherPak                    100 weather recording system with sensors for water temperature                 and solar radiation.  Wind stress is the major component                        affecting water transport.  Strong winds will drive surface                     waters but are also thought to set up a cross-shelf pressure                    gradient due to the curl of the bottom stress.  The latter is                   believed to be responsible for observed current reversals.                      Wind stress effects will be determined by monitoring water                      pressure and current flow at an inshore and offshore station in                 response to changes in wind speed and direction.  Measurements                  will be taken hourly over the course of a year to account for                   high-frequency (tidal) and low-frequency (seasonal) components.                 Results will test the theory of current reversal, and be used                   to complete the dynamic model of current flow.",
