 "awd_abstract_narration": "Post-translational modifications of proteins regulate                           important physiological and biochemical processes.  One such                    modification is the covalent attachment of the protein                          ubiquitin.  Only a small subset of the roles of ubiquitin-                      protein conjugation has been characterized in eukaryotes.                       Ubiquitin's most well-studied role is as a reusable tag                         marking proteins for proteolysis.  In plants, it has been                       found attached to the photoreceptor phytochrome and the coat                    protein of Tobacco Mosaic Virus.  The purpose of this                           research is to explore the function of ubiquitin in                             physiological processes in higher plants.  The biochemical                      analysis examines the subcellular localization of ubiquitin-                    protein conjugates in Arabidopsis.  The molecular analyses of                   ubiquitin gene expression in higher plants involve 1)                           isolation of the remaining member(s) of the ubiquitin                           extension gene family from Arabidopsis, 2) determination of                     the regulation of expression of different members of the                        ubiquitin extension gene family and 3) definition of the                        promoter regions for the ubiquitin extension genes by                           deletion analysis and site-directed mutagenesis and re-                         introduction into plants.                                                                                                                                       Ubiquitin is a protein that is widely distributed in plant,                     animal, yeast and bacterial cells.  It is one of the most                       highly conserved proteins known, having only three amino acid                   differences between the human and higher plant protein.  It                     serves a number of important biological roles in the cell,                      the most fully characterized being its role in marking                          proteins for breakdown, especially abnormal proteins.                           Current understanding of the regulation of the ubiquitin                        pathway is rudimentary.  Therefore, the goal of these studies                   is to provide fundamental information on the regulation of                      the ubiquitin pathway and the regulation of their genes in                      higher plants.***",
