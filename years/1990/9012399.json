 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the application of Glymour's                              \"bootstrapping\" account of evidential relevance to a                            methodological controversy in cognitive neuropsychology.  The                   controversy centers on an influential claim by Caramazza that                   brain-damaged performance can provide relevant evidence for                     models of cognition only in the form of single-case studies.                    If this claim is true, then group studies of brain-damaged                      performance--in particular, all studies based on the classical                  syndrome categories (such as Broca's aphasia, Wernicke's                        aphasia, conduction aphasia, etc.)--are worthless as                            confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence in constraining rival                  functional architectures.                                                                                                                                       The primary objective of this project is twofold:  firstly,                     to clarify the different methodological roles of single-case                    versus group studies, as manifested in dissociations in                         performance, double dissociations, and associations of                          deficits (the typical operational elements in cognitive                         neuropsychology), on the basis of a bootstrapping account of                    evidential relevance;  and secondly, to evaluate bootstrapping                  relative to other accounts of evidential relevance--for                         example, the hypothetico-deductive account and the Bayesian                     account--in terms of the detailed working out of this                           application.  The long-term aim is a complete analysis of the                   logic of testing models of cognition, as an aspect of the                       general theory construction in the sciences.",
