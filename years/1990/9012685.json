 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of recent scientific developments, philosophers of                      science have become increasingly interested in the ideas of                     probabilistic causation and explanation.  This contrasts with                   deterministic causation, in which causes are conceived as                       necessitating their effects, and with theories of explanation                   in which explanatory data are required logically to imply that                  the relevant phenomenon occurs.                                                                                                                                 Under a previous NSF grant, Dr. Eells wrote a book,                             Probabilistic Causality, where he distinguished type level                      causation (about causal relations in general between factors                    or properties) from token level causation (about causal                         relations between actual, concrete events), and he developed                    a new probabilistic theory for the token level.  The primary                    aim of this new project is to apply the token level theory of                   Probabilistic Causality to the proper understanding of                          explanation of particular events.  The idea of causation is                     integral to the theory of explanation, but the extension of                     a theory of causation to a theory of explanation is intricate.                  Because of analogies between Dr. Eells' token level theory of                   causation and Professor Salmon's theory of causal process                       presented in 1984, it seems that Dr. Eells theories developed                   in his book can be extended in ways that can improve upon                       Salmon's ideas involving causation in the theory of                             explanation.  Under this grant, Dr. Eells is carrying out the                   work of making this extension from the theory of causation to                   a probabilistic theory of explanation.",
