 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to understand the performance                      characteristics of fundamental algorithms that are likely to be                 broadly applicable.  The primary focus is on analytic techniques that           can result in precise performance predictions, on essential                     characteristics of specific implementations and their impact on                 practical situations, and on tools that can help uncover important              properties of algorithms.                                                                                                                                       Not all algorithms can be analyzed to the point that we can accurately          predict their performance (indeed, most cannot).  It is precisely for           this reason that much algorithm design is done at the \"complexity\"              level, where characteristics of machines, implementations, and input            models can be ignored in the search for an algorithm with good or               \"optimal\" worst-case performance characteristics.  Research from this           approach has mushroomed in recent years: scores of fundamental new              algorithms for a wide variety of new and old applications have been             devised.  Unfortunately, it is too often the case that such algorithms          are not useful in practice, because they have intricate worst-case              avoidance mechanisms that add to overhead.                                                                                                                      This research will continue the study of methods that prove                     empirically to be useful in practice, to focus design efforts on                improving the performance of such methods or devising demonstrably              better methods, and to focus analysis efforts on techniques that can            accurately predict performance.",
