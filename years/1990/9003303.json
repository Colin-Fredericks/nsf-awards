 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this study are the identification of                          intermediates in the partial and total oxidations of olefins                    on silver (110) surfaces, and quantification of the energetics                  of elementary steps in these processes.  This includes, for                     partial oxidation, the production, identification, and                          characterization of the metallocycle intermediates relevant to                  catalytic oxidtion by both atomically and molecularaly                          adsorbed oxygen, and, for total oxidation , the investigation                   of the mechanism of propylene combustion.  Electron energy                      loss spectroscopy is used to identify adsorbed intermediates                    and to measure the rates of reactions in which they                             participate, and temperature-programmed desorption is used to                   identify desorption products and to measure the rates of                        desorption.                                                                                                                                                     Partial oxidation of olefins, the process involved in this                      study, is of great commerical importance, but as presently                      practiced, can be applied only to a very few olefins.  The                      results of this study could lead to better control and                          improved yields in the existing process.  More significantly,                   it may point the way for extending this approach to additional                  olefins, which would represent a technological breakthough.",
