 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mimosa group of tropical legumes are woody plants that                 range in stature from small prickly shrubs of Mexican and                       Argentine deserts or Caribbean coral reef-shores to gigantic                    emergent forest trees of Brazilian Amazonia.  They enter all                    woodland shrub communities of the Neotropics below about 2000                   meters elevation, and are an almost ubiquitous element in the                   flora of forest margins.  Numbered among them are the stately                   saman (Albizia saman), which fills in urban Latin America the                   role of the banyan in India, and in rural Latin America provides                shade and a crop of nutritious fruits for cattle; and the                       guamuchil (Pithecellobium dulce), a staple of rural markets, the                seeds of which are enveloped in sweet pulp esteemed as a fruit                  and as basis for summer drinks.  Most of them, however, are                     appreciated primarily by local people, for whom they provide                    nursery shade trees in the coffee orchards, timber used in                      construction, furniture, and as fuel, and are a rich source of                  honey.  In these roles the mimosas of the Americas have acquired                a large vocabulary of vernacular names, both in Amerindian and                  Latin languages, testifying to their importance in the lives of                 the people who use them.                                                             The last comprehensive taxonomic inventory of the mimosa                   group dates back to 1875.  Since then much has been learned about               them, and many new species have been discovered and described.                  Most of these exist, so far as retrievable information goes, only               as names in obscure technical publications, and no one can say                  for sure how many are truly distinct species, or where they are                 to be found, or how they should be named according to current                   rules of botanical nomenclature.  There is no modern inventory                  other than the patchwork of accounts that have appeared in floras               of political units, many of which are mutually contradictory, one               species appearing under different names in different countries,                 and several distinct species often masquerading under one name.                 Without a reliable inventory, no rational decisions can be made                 about the management, exploitation, or conservation of woody                    floras on which the function of ecological systems and the                      prosperity of mankind depend.  Drs. Rupert Barneby and James                    Grimes of the New York Botanical Garden are providing this modern               inventory, for the woody tropical legumes of the large genus                    Pithecellobium and its relatives.  The results will serve as a                  source of verified information on which the writers and users of                floras can depend, for practical identification of species, for                 correct scientific nomenclature, for indication of geographical                 ranges and habitat occurrences, and for documentation of economic               uses by local peoples.",
