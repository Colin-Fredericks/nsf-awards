 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is requested for a two-year investigation of                  the geochemical, geochronological, and isotopic characteristics                 of Mesozoic plutonic rocks from the central and western Mojave                  Desert of southern California.  The main purpose of this study is               to gather data that can be used to test models for the tectonic,                magmatic, and paleogeographic evolution of southern California.                 For example, several major strike-slip and thrust faults are                    proposed to pass through the Mojave Desert.  These faults, if                   present, should produce noticeable discontinuities in the age and               isotopic character of Mesozoic plutonism.  At present there are                 virtually no data that can be used to test these hypotheses.  All               major plutonic phases will be studied in a transect running from                the western tip of the Mojave Desert to the north-central Mojave                Desert northeast of Barstow, California.  Sample collection will                be based on (1) ongoing detailed mapping by coworkers in the                    central Mojave Desert, and (2) detailed mapping by the P.I. and                 his students.  The results of this study will be useful to                      workers in several major ongoing projects in areas bordering the                Mojave Desert, including the southern Sierra Nevada, the eastern                Mojave Desert, and the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges.",
