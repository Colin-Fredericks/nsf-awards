 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Bruce S. Dunn of UCLA for collaborative                     research with Professor Manfred W. Breiter of the Institute of                  Technical Electrochemistry of the Technical University of Vienna.               The objective of their research is to learn more about the                      dielectric properties of gels during their solution, gelation and               aging stages.  They will apply impedance spectroscopy to provide                information about gel development and morphology and to gain a                  better understanding of transport properties.  The UCLA group will              be responsible for synthesizing various gels.  The collaborating                Austrian group offers unusual expertise and specialized facilities              for the spectroscopic measurement of complex impedance and the                  development of analytical models.  This arrangement provides a                  unique opportunity to apply macroscopic and microscopic analytical              techniques on the same samples.                                                                                                                                 Past studies of the electrical properties of sol-gel materials                  have been largely restricted to investigations of dried and fired               materials.  The proposed work will explore the transport processes              of gels during the earlier stages of solution and gelation.  It is              during these stages that dielectric properties are subject to                   substantial change as mobile ions become impeded and relaxation                 times are altered by structural rigidity.  A better understanding               of the relationship between transport properties and gel micro-                 structure will help them to develop gels that possess high                      impedance prior to their gelation stage.  The results will                      complement Dr. Dunn's current NSF-supported research which uses                 luminescent spectroscopy to monitor local chemical and structural               changes.  That research is aimed at the incorporation of organic                molecules into sol-gel hosts, in order to \"engineer\" new properties.",
