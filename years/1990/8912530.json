 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is an attempt to understand the molecular                 mechanisms that regulate the transcription of specific gene sets                in time and space in animal development. To achieve this goal it                will be necessary to trace the regulatory hierarchy that connects               the activation of tissue specific structural genes to the moment                of fertilization. The sea urchin embryo will be employed as an                  experimental system. Regulatory proteins that create and maintain               a histospecific program of gene transcription in development will               be purified and their genes cloned and characterized.                           Specifically, Dr. Calzone will purify and clone the gene for                    sequence specific DNA binding proteins that are essential to                    control a lineage specific program of differential gene                         transcription in the early sea urchin embryo. He will identify                  the essential nucleotides in the site of binding of key spatial                 control factors of a differentially transcribed gene. He will                   also describe the molecular mechanisms by which two recently                    identified negatively acting factors that regulate lineage                      specific transcription in the sea urchin embryo inhibit the                     effect of positive acting factors on transcription initiation.                  %%%                                                                             An understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which specific                  gene sets are selected for differential transcription in time and               space in the early embryo is essential for an understanding of                  how the fertilized egg develops into a multicellular adult                      organism.",
