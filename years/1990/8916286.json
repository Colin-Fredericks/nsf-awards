 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanism of induction of ACC synthase, the key regulatory                  enzyme in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway in plants, by various               plant hormones and environmental stimuli is poorly understood.                  Recent experimental evidence obtained in Dr. Theologis' lab with                DNA sequences complementary to the ACC synthase mRNA from                       zucchini indicate that enzyme inducers such as IAA, wounding Li                 ions act at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level.                   Studies on the structure and regulation of ACC synthase gene(s)                 in zucchini and tomato are proposed to gain insight into the                    details of the biochemical mechanism that regulates their                       expression by various hormones and stress conditions as well as                 on their role in regulating plant senescence. The specific aims                 of this proposal are: 1) Isolation and structural                               characterization of complementary and genomic sequences to ACC                  synthase mRNA from zucchini and tomato, 2) Developmental                        regulation of ACC synthase gene expression during growth, 3)                    Determination of this cis acting DNA regulatory elements that are               involved in ethylene and auxin regulated ACC synthase gene                      expression, 4) Regulation of expression of ACC synthase gene(s)                 in vivo and in isolated nuclei in response to various hormones                  and environmental stress conditions, 5) Inhibition of ethylene                  induced fruit ripening and anaerobiosis-induced epinasty with ACC               synthase antisense constructs.                                                  %%%                                                                             Ethylene is one of the simplest organic molecules with                          biological activity. It is considered to be the fruit ripening                  hormone known to regulate many aspects of plant growth,                         development and senescence. ACC synthase is the key enzyme in the               synthetic pathway of ethylene.",
