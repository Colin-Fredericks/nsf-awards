The influence of local soft soil conditions                                     on earthquake motions is often very dominant.                                   Preliminary information suggests that this is                                   particularly true for the Loma Prieta                                           earthquake.  The ability to confidently                                         predict these effects is an important                                           component in the effective design of                                            structures, in determining the accuracy of                                      seismic code provisions, and in estimating                                      damage due to an earthquake.                                                                                                                                    The goals of the project are (1) to determine                                   the ability to predict the acceleration                                         levels and response spectrum shapes of soft                                     non-linear clay profiles using equivalent                                       linear methods, and (2) to assess the                                           adequacy of existing design codes for soft                                      clay sites, using the damage potential index                                    approach, based on the recorded and computed                                    response.                                                                                                                                                       The specific objectives of this program are:                                    (1) To acquire the available strong ground                                      motion records on soft clay sites so as to                                      determine a representative spectrum shape;                                      (2) Compare this spectrum with spectrum                                         shapes proposed by Seed and Sun (1989), the                                     Structural Engineers Association of                                             California (1988) and Borcherdt (1976); (3)                                     Analyze three soft clay sites for which                                         spectrum shapes have been predicted, using                                      recorded rock motions as input values; (4)                                      Compare ground  motions computed using the                                      computer program SHAKE with recorded values,                                    in order to assess the accuracy of this                                         program; (5) Analyze three additional clay                                      sites for which the earthquake damage was                                       heavy or where recorded motions are                                             available, in order to provide additional                                       verification; and (6) Calculate the damage                                      potential index using the measured and                                          computed response motions.",
