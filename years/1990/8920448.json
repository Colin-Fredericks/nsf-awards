 "awd_abstract_narration": "The family Callitrichidae contains two types of monkeys,                   marmosets and tamarins.  Of these two, previously only the                      tamarin has been the subject of a long term study in the natural                habitat.  This is a two year field study in the caatinga scrub                  forest of northeastern Brazil of the social strategies of the                   common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus).  This study provides an                   unparalleled opportunity to study a group of animals that exhibit               polyandry, monogamy and polygyny in a single population.                        Previous studies of tamarins indicated that the polyandrous                     tendencies in this family are the result of the high costs of                   rearing the infants in this genus.  This study will replicate                   previous data collection techniques in tamarins in order to test                the validity of this model in marmosets.  This research will                    contribute to our understanding of the development and proximate                causes of mating systems, and provide a data base on the natural                behavior of the common marmoset, a species frequently utilized in               laboratory research.",
