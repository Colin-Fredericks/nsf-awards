 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will describe the spatial and temporal patterns of                 trophic structure and the proportion of total biomass in primary                producer, primary consumer, and secondary consumer trophic levels               in a desert stream ecosystem. The spatial context for this                      description will be a hierarchical arrangement of patches from                  the relatively small scale of algal or macrophyte assemblages to                large scale run-riffle-pool habitats.  Temporal change will be                  assessed along successional trajectories associated with flooding               and drying.  Losses and gains of biomass at each trophic level                  will be evaluated both within and between patches to determine                  how patches are linked.                                                              Experiments will identify mechanisms shaping trophic                       structure and causing observed temporal changes in trophic                      structure.  Mesocosm experiments will manipulate resources and                  consumers in 3-level systems, and a natural stream experiment                   will manipulate nutrients and top predators.  Descriptive and                   experimental results will be used to evaluate ecosystem-level                   consequences of specific trophic configurations; this evaluation                will indicate whether change in community-level properties drives               change in ecosystem structure and function.                                          This research explores questions concerned with the relative               influence of top-down (propagated from the top to the bottom of                 the food chain) and bottom-up (propagated from the base)                        processes in determining patterns observed in nature.  These are                important issues concerned with the responses of ecological                     systems to disturbance.  The facilities for this research are                   excellent; the investigators are productive and innovative                      experts in the area of stream ecology.",
