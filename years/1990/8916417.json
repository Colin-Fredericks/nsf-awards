 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for a renewal of funding for the                collaborative effort between F. S. Spear (RPI) and T. M. Harrison               (UCLA) to investigate the pressure-temperature-time evolution of                central New England through detailed petrological, structural and               geochronologic studies.  This is an ongoing research project, the               ultimate goal of which is to understand better the tectonic and                 therm evolution of the New England orogenies.  Work completed and               in progress under the current grant has delineated several                      projects where additional, detailed research will provide needed                constraints on the evolution of the Acadian orogen.  Proposed                   studies include:  (1) detailed petrology, kinematic analysis and                40Ar/39Ar geochronology along the Bronson Hill anticlinorium; (2)               detailed petrology, kinematic analysis and geochronology and in                 the vicinity of the Strafford dome, Vermont; (3) geochronologic                 and petrologic study of amphibolites that display anomalously old               (415-440 Ma) hornblende 40Ar/39Ar ages in eastern Vermont; (4)                  additional 40Ar/39Ar data throughout New England to delineate                   better the axis of hinged uplift between New Hampshire and                      Vermont; and, (5) theoretical analysis of cooling histories based               on a novel treatment of 40Ar/39Ar release spectra from K-                       feldspars.  We will integrate our findings with stratigraphic,                  structural, paleontological and geophysical constraints and                     attempt to reconcile these data into a coherent and consistent                  interpretation.",
