 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Development of the Nervous System.  The faculty               group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior investigators               who come from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds and work with               a variety of organisms, but share a common interest in development              of the nervous system.  The research programs in which trainees                 will participate are aimed at three problems central to the                     development of all nervous systems: neurogenesis, axonal                        navigation, and synaptogenesis.  The funds will provide stipends                for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will support                    research participation by undergraduate students, will defray part              of the cost of the trainees' research and will enable the trainees              to attend scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to              purchase specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and             to bring experts from other research and academic institutions to               aid in a summer laboratory and lecture course for trainees.                                                                                                     In recent years, remarkable advances in the use of genetics,                    biochemistry, and microscopy have led to significant new knowledge              about the development of multicellular organisms.  Despite this,                much remains to be learned about development and, in particular,                about the mechanisms of key problems posed by the development of                many different tissues and structures.  These include the                       differentiation of cell types, the basis of cell-cell recognition,              and the migration of cells during development.  In this respect,                some of the most exciting opportunities and, at the same time, most             difficult challenges are presented by developmental studies of                  animal nervous systems, which typically contain a large variety of              cell types and extend throughout the animal.  Successful research               in this area requires a mixture of diverse intellectual and                     experimental skills not often taught in traditional neuroscience                programs.  This award will provide funds for the training of young              neuroscientists who have the multiple skill needed to attack one                of the last great frontiers of modern biology.",
