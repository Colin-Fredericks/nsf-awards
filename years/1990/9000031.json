 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of chickens have provided serological and nucleic acid                  probes useful in defining the major histocompatibility complex                  (MHC) in other avian species.  Methods used in detecting genetic                diversity at loci within the MHC of chickens and mammals will be                applied to determining the extent of MHC polymorphism within                    small populations of ring-necked pheasants, wild turkeys, cranes,               Andean condors and other species.  The knowledge and expertise                  gained from working with the MHC of the chicken should make for                 rapid progress in defining the polymorphism of the MHC in these                 species and in detecting the polymorphism of MHC gene pool within               small wild and captive populations of these birds.                                                                                                              Genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are known               to encode molecules that provide the context for recognition of                 foreign antigens by the immune system.  Whether a given animal is               able to mount an immune response to the challenge of a pathogen                 is determined, in part, by the allelic makeup of its MHC.  In                   many species, an unusually high degree of polymorphism is                       maintained at multiple loci within the MHC in freely breeding                   populations.  The allelic pool within a population presumably                   provides diversity upon which to draw in the face of                            environmental challenge.  The objective of the proposed research                is to extend ongoing studies of the MHC of domesticated fowl to                 include avian species experiencing severe reduction in population               size.  Knowledge of the MHC gene pool within populations and of                 the haplotypes of individual animals may be useful in the                       husbandry of species requiring intervention for their                           preservation.",
