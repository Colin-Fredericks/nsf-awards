 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells utilize calcium ions to convert electrical signals to               biochemical changes within the cell.  Electrical activity causes                an increase of intracellular calcium in the cell.  Once inside,                 calcium acts as a messenger, carrying information to various                    parts of the cell's interior.  Only during electrical                           stimulation, or during certain pathologies, is the calcium                      concentration in the cell elevated.  Under normal resting                       conditions, the intracellular calcium concentration is kept very                low by a complex series of pathways which pump calcium out of the               cell.  The purpose of this research is to characterize the                      processes which remove calcium from nerve cells.  The                           investigator is interested in determining which pathways are                    present in nerve cells and how calcium's relative contribution                  changes with the size of a calcium challenge.  This study will                  examine calcium levels during various levels of electrical                      activity and locate the various calcium pathways in the cell.                   Nerve cells will be grown individually in culture and examined by               using optical and electrophysiological instrumentation developed                by the investigator.  This inquiry will increase the                            understanding of how nerve cells process information at the                     molecular and cellular level, revealing new target for drugs and                insight into the mechanisms of certain neurodegenerative                        disorders caused by calcium overload.",
