 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a two-year investigation into the dynamics and                  processes of deep water mass formation in the western Weddell Sea,              combining physical and chemical oceanographic techniques to                     produce a coherent picture of the importance of this unique region              to the structure of the world ocean.  In the global context, this               area is a major water mass modification site, involving open ocean              convective events, the continental margin, and the ice cover.  At               this time the various water types that combine to form Weddell Sea              Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water, and the conditions under                 which these water masses form, are not known well enough to                     establish direct physical links and volumetric budgets.  It is                  suspected that the outflow from the Weddell Sea is restricted to                quite narrow boundary currents flowing near the base of the                     continental shelf, and consequently may be observed with                        conventional current meter moorings from the shelf into the deep                ocean.                                                                                                                                                          Two oceanographic expeditions to the western Weddell Sea are                    planned as part of this study: the first in the 1990/91, and the                second in 1991/92.  The objectives will be to measure the flow of               newly-formed bottom water and to explore the sinking process of                 near-surface waters in the open ocean to see how these affect the               deep water flows.  In the first year the primary objective will be              to set out an array of eight current meters in the bottom water                 core, while a secondary objective will be to grapple for an                     existing array that was set out in early 1988 but could not be                  recovered in 1989 because Antarctic Program ship resources had to               be diverted to deal with the oil spill at Palmer Station.  In the               second year the array will be retrieved.  Hydrographic cruises in               order to define the upper ocean temperatures and salinity                       structure in the outflow region where unusually large step                      structures have been found in the past.  A chemistry program                    consistent with the objectives of the World Ocean Circulation                   Experiment (WOCE) and presently planned experiments in the South                Atlantic Ocean, will be integrated into the cruises carried out                 under this project.",
