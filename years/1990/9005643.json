 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this research are to define the sequence and                       structural elements of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA)                         required for its recognition by proteins.  Of particular                        interest is the recognition of E. coli  tRNA for amino acid                     valine (tRNAVa1) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and by the tRNA                  modifying enzyme, tRNA (uracil-5-)methyltransferase. Detailed                   understanding of these interactions will clarify questions                      concerning the fidelity of protein synthesis, the mechanisms                    of tRNA modification, and the role of modified nucleosides in                   tRNA function.  The elements of tRNAVa1 essential for its                       recognition by valyl-tRNA synthetase (VRS) will be determined                   by examining the kinetics of reaction of tRNAVa1 variants.                      Minimal requirements for synthetase recognition will be                         explored with tRNA fragments containing the essential recog-                    nition elements of tRNAVa1.  The structure of these mutant                      tRNAs will be probed by 19F NMR spectroscopy of tRNAVa1 labe-                   led with fluorine.  Fluorinated tRNAVa1 is ideally suited for                   such studies because it remains fully functional and contains                   highly sensitive 19F probes distributed throughout all the                      helical stems and the loops of the tRNA molecule where they                     can serve to monitor local structural                                           changes.",
