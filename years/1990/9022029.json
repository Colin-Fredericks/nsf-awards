 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases for                 Plant Sciences (also known as TDWG) has been a unique force in                  developing data standards for botanical information.  Their                     efforts have produced the ability to move data among many                       participating computer installations.  At an upcoming TDWG                      meeting in Delphi, Greece, an international assemblage of                       botanists, information specialists, and computer scientists will                collaborate on a design for a global information system for the                 plant sciences.  They will draft an action plan and                             specifications for efforts that will extend over the next decade                and potentially span all countries of the world.                                     Access to information on plants, their geographic                          distribution, and their ecology and taxonomy is critical to many                fields.  Biologists, land use planners, political economists, and               even the military have long-term needs for accurate data                        concerning plants.  Except for the efforts of TDWG, most of the                 energy expended on botanical data have been at the level of                     single institutions, such as an herbarium, botanical garden, or                 agriculture department within a university.  The Delphi symposium               will capitalize on these efforts, and set a productive new course               for global collaboration.",
