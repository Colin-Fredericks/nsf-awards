 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to improve course content in chemistry               laboratories at the institution, with emphasis on organic                       chemistry.  Implementation involved acquisition of Fourier                      transform infrared spectrophotometer  (FTIR), a modern                          ultraviolet-visible recording spectrophotometer (UV-VIS), two gas               chromatographs (GC) and other accessories.                                                                                                                      Student have direct hands-on experience with these instruments                  and have acquired skill in interpreting the measurements they                   provide.  FTIR and UV-VIS are used for molecular structure                      determination and have allowed enhanced knowledge of                            structure/property interrelationships.  The new instruments are                 used in conjunction with computer-assisted molecular graphics and               molecular mechanics methods.  New student exercises have been                   implemented which take advantage of the increased capabilities of               the equipment.  GC is a valuable adjunct to these methods because               it allows rapid separation, identification, and quantification of               organic substances.                                                                                                                                             The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
