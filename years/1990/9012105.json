The Symposium is organized by the Indian Institute of                    Technology, Bombay, and jointly sponsored by the Maharashta                     State Electricity Board and the Indira Gandhi Institute of                      Development Research as well as the Central Power Research                      Institute in Bangalore.  The conference theme is Power                          Systems for the year 2000.  It is expected to be widely                         attended by scientists, engineers, consultants and                              manufacturing representatives from India, and by academicians                   and scientists from around the world.  Major topics to be                       covered include large power systems, control systems, and                       decentralized systems.  The conference will be cocurrent with                   a tutorial symposium to be given by invited experts from the                    U.S and other countries.                                                        Scope:  India is embarking on a large expansion of its power                    network, with an increase from 60 Million kilowatt (KW)                         capacity to about 200 million KW within the next 25 years.                      For India, as well as for most developing countries the focus                   in this growth is expected to be on energy conservation,                        environmental consideration as well as reliability.  Sources                    for fuel, both renewable and nonrenewable, have to be                           considered.  The proposed conference provides a forum for                       discussions and exchange of information on the important                        issues related to the planning, design, construction,                           operation and maintenance of electric power systems.  It is                     likely that the conference will identify specific scientific                    problems that may be of particular importance to India, and                     other LDC's, as well as to the U.S.",
