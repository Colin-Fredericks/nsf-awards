 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over 20 different bacterial adaptive responses to                               environmental stimuli are regulated by a family of proteins,                    response regulators, sharing a conserved amino terminal                         domain.  The activity of these response regulators is                           controlled by a second family of proteins sharing a conserved                   domain, usually located at the carboxyl terminus.  Recent                       experiments with the purified signal transduction proteins                      that control nitrogen assimilation (NTR regulon), chemotaxis                    (Che) and osmoregulation (OMP regulon) indicate that the                        proteins of this second family are protein kinases and, in                      some cases, phosphoprotein phosphatases that regulate the                       adaptive responses by controlling the level of                                  phosphorylation of the response regulators.  Of these protein                   kinases, the best understood is NRII which regulates nitrogen                   assimilation by catalyzing the phosphorylation and                              dephosphorylation of the enhancer-binding transcription                         factor NRI. In this proposal, the PI presents experiments                       designed to further elucidate the mechanisms of the kinase                      and phosphatase reactions catalyzed by NRII The results of                      these experiments will probably be applicable to all of the                     homologous protein kinases.  NRII has three activities: in                      the presence of ATP, NRII is autophosphorylated on a                            histidine residue.  This phosphoryl group is then transferred                   to an aspartyl residue within the N-terminal domain of the                      response regulator NRI.  Finally, in the presence of the                        signal transduction protein PII and ATP, NRII catalyzes                         the dephosphorylation of P-NRI.  Genetic experiments are                        proposed that should define the requirements for nucleotide                     binding and the autokinase, phosphotransferase. and                             phosphatase activities by isolating or constructing mutants                     specifically deficient in these activities.  In addition,                       experiments are proposed that should directly elucidate the                     identity of the autophosphorylated histidine residue, the                       stoichiometry of autophosphorylation, and the sites of                          nucleotide binding.",
