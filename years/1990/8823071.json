 "awd_abstract_narration": "An innovative analytical technique known as surface-enhanced                    Raman scattering (SERS) is being used in combination with                       other surface analysis techniques for the non-destructive                       characterization of \"interphases\" formed when polymer systems                   are adsorbed onto or cured against metal substrates.  SERS is                   being used to investigate the adsorption of block copolymers                    and mixtures of homopolymers onto substrates such as silver                     and copper.  SERS is also being used to determine the effect                    that metal substrates have on the molecular structure of                        polymers cured against them.  The goal is to obtain                             fundamental information regarding catalysis or inhibition of                    curing reactions by metals, configurations of polymers                          adsorbed onto metal substrates, preferential adsorption of                      components of polymer systems onto metals, mechanisms by which                  polymers and small molecules interact with metals, extent of                    cure as a function distance away from a metal surface and into                  a polymer cured against the metal, and migration of metal ions                  into polymers cured against metal substrates.                                                                                                                   Processes such as preferential adsorption of components of a                    polymer systems onto a substrate and catalysis or inhibition                    of reactions within the polymer by the substrate lead to the                    formation of an interphase in the polymer adjacent to the                       substrate that has  chemical and physical properties distinct                   from those of the bulk polymer.  Since the macroscopic                          properties of adhesive bonds and composites are controlled by                   the interphase, it is essential to determine and control the                    molecular structure of interphases.  SERS is ideal for this                     purpose since it is inherently surface selective and does not                   require a polymer to be separated from a substrate for the                      interphase to be examined as do virtually all other surface                     analysis techniques.  The results obtained are being used to                    tailor the molecular structure of interphases so as to obtain                   enhanced environmental stability in structural adhesive joints                  and composites.",
