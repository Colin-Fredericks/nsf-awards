 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pattern and timing of coral reef development in the Great                   Barrier Reef (Queensland shelf, Australia) during the past                      10,000 y of the Holocene may have been controlled by changing                   surface water nutrient concentrations and seasonal upwelling                    patterns as driven by rising seal level.  The bioherms                          developed by accumulation of the aragonite plates deposited by                  the calcareous green algae Halimeda in the reefless tract                       behind the outer shelf may also be controlled by nutrient                       enrichment events.  There are no direct records of paleo-                       nutrient levels available with which to test these hypotheses.                  However, dissolved cadmium levels in seawater correlate well                    with those of phosphate, an essential limiting nutrient.                        Cadmium is incorporated in coral aragonite in proportion to its                 seawater ratio to calcium, the major cation in aragonite, and                   techniques to accurately measure Cd/Ca ratios in coral                          aragonite at the trace levels found have been developed and                     applied to study seasonal and annual surface water variability,                 primarily in corals from the Galapagos.  The utility of Cd/Ca                   measurements in coral and Halimeda for determining the nutrient                 history of the Great Barrier Reef is not yet known, however,                    this feasibility study addresses several objectives to define                   how cadmium-calcium ratios in Great Barrier Reef coral and                      Halimeda act as recorders of oceanographic conditions in that                   region during the Holocene.  These objectives involve:  (1)                     defining the degree to which terrestrial influences may affect                  measured Cd/Ca signals in Great Barrier Reef corals;  (2)                       adapting and verifying sample handling and analytical protocols                 for use with Halimeda aragonite; and  (3) documenting the                       modern and down-core trace element signals and preservational                   states in Halimeda aragonite in relationship to their                           environment.",
