 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on chemical reactions on miscible polymer blends is an                 area in which the opportunities for morphological control on top                of chemical reactivity have important implications in regard to                 final materials properties, especially in polymer blends having                 critical solution temperatures where changes in reaction                        temperature affect miscibility, phase separation, and chemical                  reactivity.  Oxidative studies will be carried out on miscible                  blends of poly(styrene) (PS) and poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME).               PVME photo-oxidizes and thermo-oxidizes much more readily than                  polystyrene -- allowing for large differences in reactivity with                oxygen.  Prior studies have indicated that the rates of oxygen                  uptake by the homopolymers are significantly different than that                of the blends.  The research will involve - understanding the                   mechanistic chemical aspects of the oxidative stabilization                     phenomena for PS/PVME blends by use of model compounds,                         additional studies on the degradation products directly obtained                from their oxidation experiments on the polymer systems, the                    effect of specific interactions such as hydrogen bonding on                     miscibility and oxidative aging in these systems, extension of                  these concepts into other systems, and the effect of added                      antioxidants and their distribution.",
