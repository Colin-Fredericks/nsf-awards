 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the role of                           histone-like proteins in the organization and folding of the                    bacterial chromosome in Salmonella typhimurium.  Our approach                   will be to use genetics to explore in vivo the contribution of                  these proteins to chromosome structure and their interactions                   with other cell proteins.  Our goal is to achieve genetic control               over each of the proteins which contribute to chromosome                        structure so that the problem can be studied as an interactive                  process in vivo.  We will pursue a number of genetic selections                 to look for compensatory mutations which describe interactions                  with the major bacterial histone-like protein HU.  We will use                  the combined approach of molecular biology and genetic selection                to identify and characterize members of this protein class.  We                 also will use in vivo genetic tools to study the regulatory                     interactions of these proteins.  Finally, we will begin to look                 at the effects of these DNA scaffolding proteins on supercoiling                and their interactions with such catalytic protein determinants                 of chromosome structure as topoisomerase and gyrase.",
