 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to enhance the laboratory experience of              undergraduate Electrical Engineering students in the area of Digital            Signal Processing (DSP).  This is accomplished through the                      acquisition of six laboratory workstations and the establishment of             a Digital Signal Processing Laboratory.  Each station consists of a             second generation TMS320 Signal Processor based algorithm development           system, an Analog Interface Board (AIB), a Spectrum Analyzer and a              Personal Computer.  The DSP course and the Senior Design Project                course are the primary targets of this laboratory enhancement.                  Students are able to develop and implement a wide variety of projects           in the area of Digital Filtering, Spectrum Analysis, Speech                     Processing and Digital Control Systems.  This project offers the                students hands-on experience and a more comprehensive understanding             of the concepts than can be obtained through lecture alone.  The                award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                    investigator's institution.",
