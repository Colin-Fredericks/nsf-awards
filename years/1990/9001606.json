 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal the principal investigator will continue                his analytical and numerical studies of discontinuous solutions                 of mathematical models of viscous, compressible flows in two and                three space dimensions.  In particular, he will investigate the                 well-posedness of the boundary value problems for the systems of                nonlinear hyperbolic equations resulting from the models, and he                will design improved numerical schemes for resolving the                        discontinuities present in the solutions.                                            Very often mathematicians and fluid dynamicists study one-                 dimensional models of complicated flow phenomena in order to gain               insights into the behavior of real flows in two and three space                 dimensions.  In the present grant the principal investigator will               extend some of his results for one-dimensional models of the                    gasdynamic equations to more realistic models in higher                         dimensions.  Problems in more than one dimension are difficult,                 and so the investigator will employ a combined analytical-                      numerical approach to study discontinuous solutions called                      \"shocks\".",
