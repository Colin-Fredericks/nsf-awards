 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work aims to develop a declarative paradigm of programming,                based on flexible constructs that can deal efficiently with large               volumes of data. Commercial query languages and logic programs                  both extend relational algebra, which is a simple fragment of                   first-order logic. These languages are declarative, in that their               semantics can be specified non-operationally. Programs can thus                 be viewed as high-level specifications and are easier to develop,               understand and maintain, and there is much promise for parallel                 execution. Current implementation techniques that support logic                 programming cannot handle large volumes of data, and techniques                 for relational query languages cannot implement recursion, to                   name two limitations. This work explores an approach based on                   program transformation followed by fixpoint evaluation that                     combines the focussing properties of logic program oriented                     techniques with the efficient set-oriented processing of                        relational techniques.  In addition to the challenges of                        efficient implementation, many aspects of the declarative                       programming paradigm, such as the right combination of features,                the role of data abstraction and object identity, the semantics                 of negation and updates, and facilities for program development                 and debugging are also being studied, and a prototype language                  called Coral is being developed.",
