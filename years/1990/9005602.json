 "awd_abstract_narration": "The experiments proposed here ask what role mRNA processing plays               in regulating the structure, stability and translation of                       messenger RNAs.  Specifically, we intend to identify both the                   cellular factors involved in mRNA 3' end cleavage and                           polyadenylation and the genes that encode them.  We will then be                able to ask physiological and biochemical questions about the                   roles of these factors in the regulation of mRNA levels during                  cellular growth and at different stages of the cell cycle.  We                  will employ a direct biochemical assay to screen a large                        collection of conditional lethal mutants for enzymatic defects                  in mRNA 3' end formation that affect cell viability or growth.                  We will clone and characterize the genes using classical genetic                and molecular biological techniques.  We will search for second                 site revertants in the expectation of identifying other genes                   whose products play a role in mRNA processing.  These mutants                   will also be used in temperature shift studies to determine the                 effects of each defect on the stability, nucleocytoplasmic                      transport and translation of mRNAs.  The isolated genes will be                 used to determine the effect of knockout mutations, site directed               alterations and controlled expression on cell growth and the                    ultimate fate of the abnormally processed mRNAs.  In a parallel                 biochemical approach, we will begin to purify the factors which                 catalyze specific cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast mRNAs.                                                                                                  This is a proposal to investigate a very poorly understood part                 of the process by which genetic information is decoded and                      expressed, viz. the assembly of a finished messenger RNA molecule               from its precursor, and the transport of the messenger RNA from                 the nucleus to the cytoplasm.",
