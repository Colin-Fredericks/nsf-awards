 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Lawrence Fagg of the Catholic                     University of America for two short term research visits to the                 National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy Physics                  (NIKHEF) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where he is collaborating               with Dr. C. W. deJager, group leader in the electron scattering                 program.  NIKHEF, the University of Virginia, Catholic University               and the Free University of Amsterdam are cooperating in a set of                experiments to determine the occupation probabilities for protons               in the 2s-1/2 shell.  Dr. Fagg's contribution to the program has                been supported to a very limited extent by the NSF Physics                      division.  Support for two more trips from the U.S.-Netherlands                 Cooperative Science Program will enable him to complete the                     remaining phases of the program.  This involves constructing,                   transporting and mounting delicate samples (targets) of Phosphorus-             31 and Sulfur-32 for exposure to the electron beam of the                       accelerator.  He will also participate in further elastic electron              scattering studies on these nuclei plus Silicon-30, acquiring the               remaining (e,e'p) data necessary to complete the analysis, and                  participating in the analysis and interpretation of the data.                                                                                                   The Independent Particle Shell Model assumes the nucleus to                     consist of nucleons moving independently in a common potential                  well.  This model has enjoyed considerable success in explaining                many essential features of nuclear structure.  One of the most                  definitive test of IPSM is to observe the behavior of penetrating               nucleon orbits in medium and heavy nuclei.  In a series of                      experiments performed at several accelerator laboratories, it was               determined that despite the relatively close spacing of nucleons in             nuclear matter, the wave function for the 3s-1/2 proton orbit in                such nuclei as Lead-206 and Lead-208 was clearly observable.  Dr.               Fagg is collaborating with Dr. deJager in extending this work to                the 2s-1/2 shell for Silicon-30, Phosphorus-31, and Sulfur-32.                  Although the value of exclusive electron scattering reactions for               such studies, in particular the (e,e'p) reactions, has long been                known, it is only with the advent of high resolution, higher-duty-              factor accelerators such as those at Saclay and NIKHEF that this                reaction can now be adequately exploited.  There are no facilities              in the U.S. with instrumentation of sufficient resolution to                    carry out the proposed measurements.  NIKHEF is contributing                    ninety hours of beamtime for the project.",
