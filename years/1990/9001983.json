 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative work between Professor                    Mihir Sen of the University of Notre Dame and Professor                         Eduardo Ramos of the Solar Energy Laboratory in Temixco,                        Mexico.  The researchers intend to study nucleate boiling                       from single-and multiple capillary sites.  Variable heat                        flux will be used as a control parameter to analyze the                         sequence of bifurcations leading from periodic boiling up to                    chaos.  In order to assess the contribution of phase change                     to the observed phenomena, a similar study without phase                        change, but with the controlled injection of an inert gas,                      will also be carried out.  In this case the mass flow rate of                   the inert gas will be the relevant bifurcation parameter.  The                  bulk of the phase change work will be done in the U.S., while                   most of the inert gas studies will be in Mexico.                                                                                                                One part of the work will consist of extensive observation                      and interpretation of an experimental nature.  Another will                     be the development of a suitable analytical model for the                       processes which can qualitatively explain the observed                          phenomena.  Though the cylindrical capillary structure                          chosen for study is the simplest geometry from a basic point                    of view, results from this study are expected to advance our                    fundamental understanding of boiling.  As such the proposed                     work has potential application to the design of thermal                         equipment operating under boiling conditions and to the                         preparation of structured surfaces for enhanced heat transfer.",
