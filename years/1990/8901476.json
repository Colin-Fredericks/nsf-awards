 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our present understanding of the regulation of cellular metabolic events        is limited by our ability to reproduce subcellular organizational               components in vivo.  In the present proposal, we outline a series of            experiments designed to investigate the organization of the hormone-            responsive phosphoinositide cycle in the rat cell line, WRK-1.  We have         previously reported the existence of both vasopressin-sensitive and             insensitive phosphoinositides in these cells, and more recent data              suggests a physical compartmentation of the cycle, as well.  Our present        goals are three fold:  1) Using two different agonists, vasopressin and         bradykinin, we will determine whether a common or distinct                      phosphoinoitide lipid pool is involved in the cyclic metabolic response         to different stimuli.  The results of these experiments will indicates          how closely the receptor is associated with hormone-responsive lipid            pools.  2) To determine the degree to which the phosphoinositide cycle          is a closed metabolic phenomenon within the cell, we will carry out             experiments designed to test whether or not exogenous substrate                 intermediates can participate in hormone-stimulated cycling.  A negative        result in this instance would suggest that all the enzymes of the cycle         are arranged in such a manner that the product from one reaction is             channeled directly to the next enzyme in the pathway.  3) We will               examine the mechanism by which phosphatidylinositol resynthesis is              stimulated during cycling using a combination of whole cell and broken          cell protocols.  We will determine whether the hormone induced increase         in synthesis of phosphatidylinositol is the result of increased                 substrate concentrations or enzyme activation or both.  The combined            results of these studies should provide insight into the organizational         aspects of phosphoinositide cycling, giving us a more accurate picture          of the biochemical events involved in cellular regulation.                                                                                                      It has for a number of years been appreciated that one of the major             pathways of transmembrane signaling by hormones involves the breakdown          of particular phospholipid components of the cell membrane.  Dr.                Monaco's prior work has demonstrated that only a fraction of the total          phospholipid present in the membrane is susceptible to hormone-                 stimulated breakdown.  Thus, only that portion is capable of serving as         a source of second messenger in the cellular response to hormone.  The          continuation of this research is directed toward further identification         of the mechanisms that, in effect, compartmentalize the cell membrane           phospholipids into hormone-sensitive and insensitive fractions.  The            results of this research will contribute to our fundamental                     understanding of the complex mechanisms by which cells respond to               extracellular signals.",
