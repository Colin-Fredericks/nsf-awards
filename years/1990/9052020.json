 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was designed to upgrade the undergraduate chemistry                curriculum at the institution.  The objectives were to expand the               laboratory program in chemistry in the upper level courses and to               provide more equipment with which to carry out student oriented                 research projects.  The project forms an integral part of the                   University plan to emphasize the sciences on the campus.                                                                                                        The specific activities of the project involved two specific                    areas, namely (1) the acquisition of new equipment to expand the                range of laboratory experiments available and (2) the expansion                 of the research program.                                                                                                                                        The main outcomes of the project are an improvement in the basic                undergraduate curriculum in chemistry through an improvement in                 the resources that are available to the student.  The improvement               results in a better prepared graduate of the University who in                  turn is be better able to compete at the professional level after               graduation.                                                                                                                                                     The institution contributed to the project in an amount slightly                in excess of the NSF funds.",
