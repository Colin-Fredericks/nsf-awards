 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates techniques that allow programs written                in the Production System (PS) paradigm to reason correctly and                  efficiently with large databases located on secondary storage. A                class of stratified PS programs are identified. For this class                  of programs, an operational semantics and a model theoretic                     semantics are developed. The correct semantics ensure that a                    stratified PS program will correspond to a consistent theory,                   the execution of the program will not produce incorrect,                        inconsistent answers and execution of the program will                          terminate. Implementation techniques for stratified PS programs                 using relational data structures and relational queries are                     developed as well as strategies for the concurrent execution of                 productions in stratified PS programs. The results of this                      research will provide a foundation for expert systems, written as               stratified PS programs, to reason correctly and efficiently with                data in relational databases.",
