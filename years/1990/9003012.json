 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure and function of the components of the binding                     protein mediated membrane transport system for ribose in E. coli                will be probed by two main approaches.  First, site-directed                    mutagenesis studies on the ribose binding protein will be                       continued in order to define the surfaces on the ribose binding                 protein which interact with the chemotaxis (trg) and the ribose                 transport receptors on the cytoplasmic membrane.  Our recant                    studies of this type located one site near the \"hinge\" of the                   binding protein which eliminated chemotaxis when an Ile residue                 was changed to Arg.  Further probing of this site and residues                  near it are planned as well as sites near the cleft of the                      binding protein which appear to affect transport.                               Second, overexpression, isolation, and characterization of the                  components of the membrane transport complex for ribose will be                 continued.  Two of the three proteins in the complex have been                  purified, one of which has been shown to be homologous to a                     family of ATP-binding proteins including the eukaryotic multiple                drug resistance proteins and the newly identified cystic                        fibrosis-related protein.  Physical and biochemical studies will                be performed on the purified transport protein, and attempts to                 overexpress the third will be continued.  Once all three are                    produced, reconstitution of the transporter in vitro will be                    pursued.  A reconstituted system, along with the information                    related to the surface of the binding protein which interacts                   with the transported, will allow future biochemical studies of                  the mechanism of transport,  A related objective is to                          overexpress the repressor for the rbs operon, a molecule which                  was shown to be homologous both to a family of repressors and                   also to the family of binding proteins to which ribose binding                  protein belongs.  This led to a model for the repressor mechanism               which will be testable biochemically and structurally once                      significant amounts of the pure repressor are obtained.",
