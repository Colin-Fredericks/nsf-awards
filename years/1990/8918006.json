 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Nadkarni will investigate the functional role of the                   canopy- dwelling epiphyte community in nutrient cycling in a                    primary tropical montane cloud forest.  She hypothesizes that                   epiphytic matter functions as a \"keystone component\" by                         contributing to atmospheric nutrient recruitment and                            within-system nutrient retention.  Nadkarni combines several                    research approaches including: 1) a process-oriented                            experimental approach in the lab and field to test specific                     hypotheses on how epiphytes increase nutrient recruitment and                   nutrient retention within the canopy and,  2) a plot approach                   to quantify nutrient pools and fluxes, including an estimation                  of ecosystem-level ephiphyte biomass, litterfall, throughfall,                  and certain gaseous fluxes.  This information will be                           integrated into a nutrient cycling model that will be tested                    and validated with measurements of nutrient pools and fluxes in                 an adjacent secondary forest which has virtually no epiphytes.                  This work will relate canopy processes to other aspects of                      ecosystem ecology in tropical forests and will contribute to                    the growing body of knowledge of the poorly known tropical tree                 canopy.  More generally, this can be viewed as a case study for                 any complex ecosystem that contains \"keystone ecosystem                         elements\", certain components that may have greater functional                  importance than their                                                           biomass or appearance suggests.                                                      Dr. Nadkarni is an outstanding researcher in the area of                   tropical epiphytic communities.  The Marie Selby Botanical                      Gardens provides exemplary support for Dr. Nadkarni in this                     critical area of research.",
