 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in statistics and                probability between Dr. David Mason, University of Delaware and                 Professor Paul Deheuvels, Laboratory for Theoretical and Applied                Statistics, University of Paris VI, France.                                                                                                                     The investigators will focus on the following areas:  1) increment              processes, which include functional laws of the iterated logarithm              for the increments of the empirical process, nonparametric                      function estimation and two sample Bahaduir-Kiefer test statistics,             and 2) tail processes, which among other problems encompass                     statistical inference about the tails of a distribution and                     testing for outliers.  Inference about the upper tail of a                      distribution has a large number of important applications, such as              in insurance to estimate the probability of a large claim or in                 engineering to determine a reasonable safe height to construct a                dam or oil platform.  The two investigators are considered leading              researchers in this area of mathematics and the proposed project                will benefit from their complementary expertise and previous                    successful collaborative efforts.",
