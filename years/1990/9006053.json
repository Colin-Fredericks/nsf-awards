If laser                  instrumentation is combined into a central laser laboratory,                    the research of a group of top-notch investigators can be                       effectively enhanced.                                                                                                                                           The Department of Chemistry at Purdue University will use this                  award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program to help acquire                 modern laser instrumentation.  The areas of research that will                  will be enhanced by the acquisition include the following:                                                                                                      1.
