 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Ringo has an excellent model system to determine how genetic                changes affect behavior by the endocrine system.  The  apterous                 locus in Drosophila is crucial for the survival of embryos and                  young, and for the normal development of wings and specific                     endocrine glands that are involved in the production and                        secretion of juvenile hormone.  Juvenile hormone is a major                     growth regulator in insects as well as being required for normal                oogenesis and the development of reproductive behavior.  Using a                multidisciplinary approach, Dr. Ringo will genetically dissect                  the endocrine basis of reproduction in Drosophila.   Using                      specific mutations of the apterous gene, he can define precisely                the extent and timing of the behavioral defects, and determine                  the exact relationship between these defects and the level of                   juvenile hormone.  This research not only open doors at                         elucidating the molecular basis of hormonally controlled behavior               patterns, but it could lead to noninvasive means of insect pest                 control.  This is very important especially given the recent                    controversy surrounding chemical spraying for control of insects,               specifically flys, in populated environments.",
