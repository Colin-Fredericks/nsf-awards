 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical research undertaken in this project follows two               related themes, both within the context of functions of several                 complex variables.  The first is concerned with the question of                 removable singularities.  There is a significant change in the                  phenomenon of singularities as soon as one goes from one to                     several variables.  Points or sets where holomorphic functions                  may be extended as holomorphic functions are called removable                   singularities.  One of the goals of this continuing work is to                  characterize removable singularities by means of the algebra of                 functions defined in neighborhoods of the singularities.  In                    examples which have been worked out, when the singular set is                   convex with respect to the algebra, it is removable.  A related                 question to be taken up concerns the characterization of smooth                 manifolds in the boundary of a domain which are removable.                           The second thrust of the project concerns the boundary                     values of holomorphic functions.  Two points of view prevail.                   One is to determine whether a smooth function on the boundary                   continues holomorphically to the interior, the other is concerned               with the question of the extent to which a holomorphic function                 on the interior extends to the boundary in some reasonable                      fashion.  In the former case, work will concentrate on efforts to               determine whether functions which can be continued                              holomorphically along lower dimensional manifolds, complex lines                for example, are holomorphic in the large.                                           Boundary considerations lead naturally to applications of                  geometric analysis, while the extension theory is closely tied                  with that of solving systems of partial differential equations.",
