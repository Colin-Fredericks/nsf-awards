 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop new                        methods which utilize recombinant DNA technology and affinity                   separations to produce peptide (small proteins) effectively.                    Emphasis will be placed upon improving two complex parts of                     the purification process:  1) removal of cell debris, and 2)                    final purification to high purity.  The peptide, human atrial                   natriuretic peptide, will be expressed fused to the protein                     asparaginase in the bacterium e. coli.  The fusion protein                      will also contain a metal affinity binding site (MABS), which                   will be utilized in selectively removing the fusion protein                     from the cell debris.  Two different MABS and two different                     locations of each MAB on the fusion protein will be evaluated.                                                                                                  Final purification of the fusion protein will be by affinity                    chromatography on immobilized D-asparagine.                                                                                                                     The significance of the proposed research is that it can lead                   to new processes for producing peptide at significantly lower                   cost and on a much larger scale than at present.  The research                                                                                                  is also significant in that it can lead to a better                             understanding of how to design a MABS on proteins, which would                                                                                                  be useful in the purification of proteins as well as peptide.",
