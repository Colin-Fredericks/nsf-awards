 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of the economic activity in cities located in developing              nations is conducted by persons who operate informally.  These people           work independently or in small organizations in ways that circumvent            formal government control or supervision.  The share of urban                   populations engaged in these types of activities has grown rapidly in           recent decades, leading scholars to debate whether the informal                 economic sector functions as a separate unit or whether it performs             within a broader framework within which formal economic establishments          still maintain primary power.  This doctoral dissertation project will          examine the form and function of informal economic activities in Quito,         Ecuador, in order to describe the structure and diversity of activities         and to analyze how persons engaged in informal activities interact with         each other and with other individuals and institutions.  Labor-force            data in Ecuador's three largest cities will be analyzed to compare              formal-informal economic patterns, and interviews with persons engaged          in informal activities will be conducted to examine links among persons         in the informal sector, the formal sector, and the government.                  Attention also will be given to identifying how working relations               affect the economic mobility of persons engaged in informal activities.              This project will provide valuable data and analyses of the                operations of persons engaged in informal economic activities.                  Although focusing on an Ecuadorian case study, the insights from this           project will be of great use to persons conducting related work                 elsewhere.  This project also will provide an excellent opportunity for         a promising young scholar to continue to develop independent research           skills.",
