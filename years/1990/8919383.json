 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite a long history of distinguished research, our                           understanding of how humans perceive the shapes, sizes, and                     locations of objects in the three-dimensional space surrounding                 them is still incomplete.  In particular, we are only beginning                 to understand how motion of an image on the retina, resulting                   from movement of the object being observed or of the observer,                  leads to a perception of object shape and of spatial layout of a                complex scene.  One reason that this aspect of space perception                 is only now receiving due consideration is that proper                          investigation of the question was impossible until recently, when               fairly powerful graphics computers became widely available.                                                                                                     This research will address how adult human observers are able to                perceive three-dimensional shape solely from retinal image motion               as might be produced by a rapid succession of flat images on a                  computer video display.  The primary goals are to identify which                aspect of the retinal image motion is critical for the perception               of 3-D shape and to develop a computational model that can                      predict the perceived shapes corresponding to different patterns                of retinal motion.  Another goal is to determine the degree to                  which the perception of 3-D shape, once built up, perseveres in                 the absence of sustaining retinal stimulation; there is evidence                that some sort of internal representation does remain even when                 sensory stimulation is interrupted.  A final goal is to determine               how the perceived shape produced by retinal stimulation depends                 upon the perceived distance of the stimulus; prior work suggests                that the perceived shape of a simulated object undergoing                       rotation varies in a different fashion with distance of the                     simulated object than the perceived shape of such an object                     undergoing side-to-side motion (translation).  If confirmed, this               result will provide important clues to the nature of the brain                  process involved in the perception of three-dimensional shape                   from motion.                                                                                                                                                    Enhanced understanding of these processes may lead to two                       important applications.  First, it will indicate ways of                        optimizing displays for use in scientific visualization;                        scientific visualization refers to the use of 3-D animations as                 tools in understanding abstract scientific concepts (e.g.,                      electron cloud), structures (e.g., complex molecules), and                      processes (e.g., molecular interactions).  Second, enhanced                     understanding of how humans recover shape from motion will point                to one possible way for computer visual systems to exploit                      optical motion in the analysis of complex scenes.  In addition,                 understanding human perception of shape from motion will                        contribute to understanding of the more general problem of visual               space perception, mentioned above.",
