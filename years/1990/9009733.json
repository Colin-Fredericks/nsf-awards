Dr. Banita White                  Brown of the Chemistry Department of the University of North                    Carolina at Charlotte will attempt to prepare several one-armed                 and two-armed peptide-derived lariat esters.  Circular                          dichroism (CD) measurements will be made on at least two                        systems in order to test the feasibility of CD in determining                   binding constants for sodium, potassium, and calcium cations.                   The lariat esters are expected to behave as ionophores and                      exhibit selectivity for particular cations.  If promising                       results are obtained, a proposal for sustained study in this                    area may be developed, perhaps focussing on competition between                 sidearm and ring sites for complexation or the roles of                         conformation and donor group polarity in cation selectivity.",
