 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Federation of Information Processing Societies is                  conducting a Workshop on Computational Science for Faculty of                   Undergraduate Institutions without doctoral programs at the                     University of North Carolina, Asheville, during the week of                     August 6 through August 12, 1990.  Sixteen well qualified                       individuals have offered to help in the organizing, planning                    and conduct of the Workshop.  Approximately 30 participants                     will be selected.  Of these 30 participants, at least 20 will                   come from those schools which traditionally accommodate                         undergraduates from populations under-represented in the                        mathematical and physical sciences.                                                                                                                             The objective of the Workshop is to assist the faculty members                  to enhance their curricula and attract students to courses in                   sciences such as computer science, mathematics, physics and                     chemistry.  During the one week of the Workshop, it is intended                 to illustrate a generic model of a one semester course on                       \"Introductory Computational Science\".  This will be                             accomplished by lectures, demonstrations, video presentations                   and hands-on experiences using IBM personal computers, Apple                    Macintosh computers and remote supercomputers.",
