The lamps are presently                      used for a variety of industrial applications:  lower power                     density light sources for drying industrial inks, coatings and                                                                                                  adhesives on papers, metals, plastic, and glasses; and higher                   power density sources in the manufacture of semiconductor                       device and in imaging applications.                                                                                                                             Phase I research made promising improvements on the efficiency                                                                                                  of jet impingement cooling and created a better understanding                   of the mechanisms involved.  Phase II research will optimize                    the improvements and apply the results to actual lamp systems                   suitable imaging and semiconductor applications.  In addition,                                                                                                  more advanced mechanisms of cooling will be investigated, such                                                                                                  as closed cycle helium cooling and evaporative cooling                          techniques.  Improvement of the cooling techniques for the                      lamps will allow the design and construction of UV light                        sources with power densities even greater than the current                      limit of 500 W/cc, and these have new applications, including                   DUV (deep U.V.) optical                                                         lithography for manufacturing semiconductors, and in the next                   generation projection televisions.",
