 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dordt College will initiate a two-week, commuter, Young Scholars            project in engineering for 30 students in grades 8-9.                                                                                                           The purpose of this project is to motivate students to consider                 engineering as a vocational goal.  The project includes a series of             coordinated lectures and laboratory experiences which stimulate the             students' interest in engineering, develop the necessary skills and             talents, and inform the students as to the essential high school courses        required to pursue an engineering degree.  Field trips to cooperating           industries reinforce classroom activities.  Students are assigned a             project which requires them to use what they have learned in the                classroom, laboratory, and workplace.  The academic year follow-up              activities demonstrate completed projects, and provide motivation for           peers to pursue the workshop in the future.",
