 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, society is demanding that people put their knowledge to           use. One such application is the design of artifacts.  The importance of        technological support in the design process is clearly recognized by            professional designers.  The aim of this project is to explore                  how high schools and college students can best be supported as they             learn a  particular type of design process--software design.  To this           end, an educationally-motivated and educationally-sound computer-aided          design environment (SODA, Software Design Lab) will be developed and            classroom tested; SODA goes beyond merely supporting slices of the              design process, and provides support for the four major activities in           software design:  planning, generating and evaluating alternative               designs, debugging, and reflecting.  Key to effective design is the             management of complexity.  Thus, in SODA, there will be mechanisms to           manage artifact complexity (e.g., plan  libraries), process complexity          (e.g. aids to create and then navigate among  alternative designs), as          well as mechanisms to facilitate learning (e.g.,                                scaffolding and customization).                                                                                                                                 The research plan is to test increasingly more sophisticated versions of        SODA, in four different educational environments using a broad range of         students.  A systematic procedure has been designed to assess student           performance as well as process, using quantitative and qualitative              methods; transfer of design skills will also be examined.",
