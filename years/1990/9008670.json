 "awd_abstract_narration": "AI planners have traditionally made certainty and simplicity                    assumptions which have obscured two important distinctions:  that               the time at which a plan is executed differs from the time at                   which the plan is built, and that the planning agent's model of                 the world will differ from the real world.  Relaxing these                      assumptions indtroduces the problem of maintaining a planning                   agent's world model, which will be both imcomplete and dynamic.                 A framework for representing and maintaining such a model, has                  been developed which takes into account reports from external                   sources (e.g. sensors), the agent's proposed actions or plans,                  and external forces that may aid or confound those plans.                       Extensions to this framework will allow the agent to reason about               (1) execution-time reports from sensors, thus allowing it to                    detect planning failures and learn from bad predictions, and (2)                complex causal structures, thus allowing it to represent more                   realistic physical systems (like the ones studied in the                        qualitative-physics literature).",
