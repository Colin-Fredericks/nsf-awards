 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible                                     to liquefaction when subjected to strong                                        ground shaking, such as occurs during an                                        earthquake.  Liquefied soils experience a                                       decrease in bearing strength: this can lead                                     to the partial or total collapse of buildings                                   standing on liquefied soils.                                                                                                                                    The aim of this proposal is to verify the                                       analyses used to predict liquefaction due to                                    earthquake loading.  Since the field data                                       needed for this verification is extremely                                       difficult to obtain, data is being used                                         instead from laboratory experiments performed                                   on geotechnical centrifuges.  This is a                                         relatively new technique for soil testing                                       which is becoming well accepted in the                                          geotechnical research community.  The                                           technique for simulating earthquakes on                                         centrifuges is being developed, and the                                         results obtained have generated confidence in                                   the method: questions that remain to be                                         answered are being addressed in this study.                                                                                                                     Different geotechnical structures, including                                    sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and                                        embankments are being investigated so as to                                     validate the applicability of the                                               liquefaction analysis methods to a variety of                                   geotechnical structures.  Class A predictions                                   - which involve predicting the soil response                                    without knowing the measured results - are                                      used for later comparison with measured                                         results.

It is also responsible for                                          managing the prediction studies.
