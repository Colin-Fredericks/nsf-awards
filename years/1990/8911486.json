The existence of such fully expressive                   systems arising outside the mainstream of spoken languages                      affords a new vantage point for investigating biological                        constraints on linguistic form.  The research centers around the                structured use of space and movement in the grammatical processes               of signed languages.                                                                                                                                                 The investigators couple new linguistic analyses with                      powerful techniques for three dimensional computergraphic                       analysis in two major series of experiments.  1) Sign space,                    mental space, and language universals:  The area where American                 Sign Language (ASL) is most clearly conditioned by the visual                   modality is in the spatialized mechanisms for conveying syntax                  and discourse.  The research will explore the underpinnings of                  the spatialized syntax of American and Chinese Sign Language, and               investigate the relations of sign space to mental spatial                       representations.  2) Biological and linguistic constraints on                   structure:  the investigators will study prosodic rhythmic and                  timing processes in sign language, which will help distinguish                  language particular characteristics from more general ones.                     Three-dimensional computergraphic techniques make possible direct               analysis of sign language articulation.  The study of signed (as                contrasted with spoken) language will provide important clues to                the biological basis for the prosodic determination of                          phonological structures.  The importance of prosody goes beyond                 illuminating the functional role of this linguistic level in ASL;               it also serves as probes to the brain's control of rhythm and                   timing more generally.                                                                                                                                               The studies proposed should provide insight into the                       principles governing the structural organization of language,                   into the ways languages are shaped by their modality of                         expression, and into the functional organization of the brain for               language.",
