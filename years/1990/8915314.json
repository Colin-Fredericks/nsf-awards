 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genus Pheidole includes more than 500 species of ants,                 concentrated in the tropics of the New World.  Ant colonies of                  this genus can be very abundant in certain habitats, and they are               common constituents of most tropical terrestrial settings.                      Species of the genus display an impressive range of ecological                  habits, including termite predation, symbiosis on plants,                       arboreal nest-building, and mimicry on termites and other ants.                 Unfortunately, ecological and behavioral research on this diverse               genus is hampered by the lack of a solid understanding of its                   taxonomy and diversity.  More than half of the New World species                have never been described formally and named, and there is no                   comprehensive guide to their classification and identification.                 Dr. E. O. Wilson proposes to complete his long-term study of the                group, culminating in a taxonomic monograph, illustrated                        identification key, and species-level classification.  Field work               in Costa Rica, Brazil, and Peru will add valuable new collections               to the study, as will the Smithsonian's BIOLAT insect inventory                 project.                                                                             The proposed study will open a variety of research                         opportunities in tropical biology.  Ecologists and behavioral                   biologists will use the proposed identification keys and                        classification to add precision and rigor to their studies.                     Future surveys of tropical diversity will use this study as a                   baseline for assessing changes in diversity.  The proposed                      project will find a wide audience beyond the ranks of ant                       systematists.",
