 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support contiued collaborative research among the               following researchers:  Dr. J.B. Natowitz, Cyclotron Institute,                 Texas A&M University, Drs. Albert Demeyer and Daniel Drain,                     Institute of Nuclear Physics, Lyon and Dr. Alain Giorni, Institute              of Nuclear Sciences, Grenoble, France.  The objective of the                    research is the study of nuclear properties at high excitation                  energy.                                                                                                                                                         The experimental program to be pursued will focus on measurements               of the properties of nuclei having hundreds of MeV of excitation                energy produced in heavy ion induced reactions.  Among the                      properties to be determined are the heat capacities, limiting                   temperatures and modes of de-excitation or disassembly.  Studies                of hot nuclei near the limits of self-bound nuclear systems allows              stringent tests of theoretical models of the nucleus and provide                new information on nuclear dynamics and the nuclear equation of                 state at elevated temperature.  The AMPHORA detector array at                   Grenoble and new detection equipment available at Texas A&M will                be the primary research tools employed in this work.  The project               will benefit from the significant expertise of Dr. Natowitz on                  this topic, as well as the sharing of U.S. and French accelerators              and equipment.  The latter will greatly help in obtaining the                   necessary beam time, and in full construction of an optimal                     experimental set up.8914710                                                     Beck                                                                            This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Jean                 Galtier and Dr. Brigitte Meyer-Berthaud, Universite des Sciences                et Techniques du Languedoc, Montpellier, France, and Dr. Charles                Beck, University of Michigan, Ann Arber and Dr. William Stein,                  State University of New York-Binghamton, centering the origin and               early evolution of seed plants.  These two research groups have                 access to especially large and important collections of some of                 the earliest known seed plants, members of the extinct Lower                    Carboniferous seed fern family, Calamopityaceae, from the New                   Albany Shale of the United States, and the Lydiennes Formation of               the Montagne Noire of France.                                                                                                                                   In the recent years, it has become increasingly clear that input                from fossil early seed plants is essential for correctly inferring              seed plant phylogeny.  However, to be successful more comprehensive             geological and geographic perspectives on calamopityacean and                   other early seed plant remains must be developed.  This award will              provide travel support  to allow the investigators to integrate                 their research efforts in several areas including:  i) detailed                 systematic analysis of very similar material described independently            by the two groups, ii) a concerted effort to improve the methods                by which information on these forms is collected, including                     development of morphometric analytical techniques for assessing                 homology in the primary vascular system, iii) development of plans              for a comprehensive database on early seed plant remains suitable               for a wide range of research problems, and iv) a phylogenetic                   analysis of seed plant origins concentrating on the fossil                      evidence of this group's early members.",
