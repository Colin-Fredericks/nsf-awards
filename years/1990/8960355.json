 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I SBIR award provides funds to construct solid state                 beta-ray detectors for use in capillary electrophoresis.                        Electrophoresis is one of the most important and widely used                    analytical techniques for the separation and identification of                  biological molecules.  Recently, there has been a significant                   advance in electrophoresis technology through the use of gel                    geometries involving thin capillary tubes.  This technology has                 been developed into a new separation technique, capillary zone                  electrophoresis (CZE) and is particularly appropriate for the                   separation of low abundance materials.  This technique provides                 much greater resolution than traditional electrophoresis                        techniques and can achieve separations of complex mixtures as                   much as an order of magnitude faster.                                                                                                                           The CZE technology is currently of very high interest since it                  appears to make possible the development of new, high speed                     instrumentation for analytical biochemistry.  However, in order                 to make full use of this new, powerful separation technique,                    several aspects of the technology require further development.                  This project addresses the particular need for a nuclear                        detection system which will allow CZE to be used effectively for                the more common separation experiments carried out in molecular                 biology laboratories.",
