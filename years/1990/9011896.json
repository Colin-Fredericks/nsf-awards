 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of the genetics of our non-human primate relatives has               been hampered by the invasive nature of obtaining samples for                   analysis from living tissue.  Now it is possible to obtain                      sufficient DNA from hair which can easily be obtained non-                      invasively, even from the nests of wild animals in their native                 habitat.  In this study hair will be used as the prime source of                DNA for determining genetic relationships in two species of                     chimpanzees.   Segments of selected nuclear and mitochondrial                   genes will be amplified enzymatically by the polymerase chain                   reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly or analyzed for size                      polymorphism.  In most individuals studied, sequences at six or                 more loci will be compared cladistically to address questions of                pedigree and phylogenetic relationships, gene flow, and mating                  systems.  In collaboration with Dr. Oliver Ryder, the PI will                   study intrapopulation variation and develop formal genetic                      pedigrees for two well known breeding colonies: Pan pansicus at                 the San Diego Zoo, and Pan troglodytes at the North Carolina                    Zoological Park.  In collaboration with Dr. Jane Goodall, the PI                will study genetic variation in members of the Kasakela community               of Pan troglodytes at Gombe National Park, Tanzania.  A 30-year                 retrospective genetic pedigree for this community of chimpanzees                will be attempted.  By using the PCR method of analysis on                      samples of chimpanzee hair, it will be possible to obtain genetic               information not previously obtainable.",
