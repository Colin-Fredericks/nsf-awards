 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research in solid state physics,            involving Drs. R.E. Johnson and J.W. Boring, University of                      Virginia and Dr. B.U. Sundquist, Tandem Accelerator Laboratory,                 University of Uppsala, Sweden.  The objective of the project is to              describe the common mechanisms for electrical-induced desorption                and modification of a variety of organic materials and molecular                insulators.                                                                                                                                                     The US investigators have been carrying out a theoretical program               on modeling the electronic and chemical processes which are                     initiated when an ion penetrates insulating materials, as well as               an experimental program for electron and keV ion modification of                such materials.  A primary effort has been the study of low-                    temperature, molecular condensed gases.  Dr. Sundquist's research               group at Uppsala, using the tandem accelerator and recently                     acquired lasers, has been studying MeV ion and laser-induced                    desorption of large biological molecules from samples of condensed              molecules as a unique means of mass determination.  They have also              been studying modification of certain electronic insulators with                the tandem accelerator.  In the next few years they will have the               ability to irradiate with very high energy particles using the new              accelerator which was built at Uppsala. The US and Swedish efforts              have concentrated on describing the principal energy ejection                   processes which occur in the bulk; however, they have begun to                  describe the common energy transfer processes occuring in molecular             solids.  In the proposed collaboration the two groups will study                organic solids; the experiments performed by the two groups will be             coordinated in order to expose the common aspects of the physical               and chemical mechanisms.  The project will benefit from the                     recently-added capabilities of the Uppsala group to study neutral               biomolecule ejection and laser desorption and of the ability of                 Virginia group to make complementary measurements  on chemically                similar samples. Results of this research will be of interest in a              number of scientific areas, such as biophysics, astrophysics,                   electronics and pharmaceuticals.",
