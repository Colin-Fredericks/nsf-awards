It will:                                                                                                                      1. Train 60 high school science, mathematics and computer                          science teachers how to use interactive technologies in                         the classroom.  This 1990-91 academic year component                            will stress hypermedia, intelligent tutoring systems,                           repurposed videodiscs, microworlds, coaches, inspectable                        simulations, computer animation, and automated data                             collection and analysis.  The teachers will learn how                           to:                                                                             o Teach students how to solve scientific problems using                           the heuristic approach of Polya.                                              o Manage CAI and video/digital audio projects (including                          writing, producing, implementing, and evaluating                                them).                                                                        o Use the computer to write multimedia programs.                                o Deal with the different learning styles of students.                          o Recognize science preconceptions and help students to                           overcome them.                                                                o Evaluate software and interactive products.                                   o Create instructional material with such commonly                                available tools and microcomputers and workstations.                                                                                                     The teachers will finish the program's first phase with                         projects they design and implement themselves.                                                                                                                    2. Select 30 of the original participants to develop                               indepth projects.  Fifteen will attend SFSU and fifteen                         URI for six week workshops during the summers of 1991                           and 1992.  They will also work at the Universities on a                         20 to 50 percent release time basis during the 1991-92                          academic year.                                                             3.   Evaluate how well the teacher developed materials work                          with large numbers of students.  It will also evaluate                          additional material that workers at Tufts University,                           SFSU, URI and their collaborators have developed in the                         areas of physics, chemistry, astronomy and mathematics.                    4.   Develop a series of probes and sensors along with                               computer analysis tools to measure such phenomena as                            heat, temperature, electromotive force, light,                                  oscillations, and sound.  The teachers will use these                           tools to produce a large number of laboratory                                   experiments.  The experiments, teacher notes, and                               follow-up materials will be published in a manual at the                        end of the program.\f                                                       5.   Distribute donated computer equipment and other                                 hardware, when appropriate, to participating school                             districts.                                                                                                                                                 The microcomputers and workstations used in CATALYST will be                    the most modern and will come from major vendors.  To be sure                   teaching methods are designed that accommodate the wide range                   of ability and preparation among students, project directors                    will rely on such curriculum ideas as those from the AAAS-                      sponsored Project 2061, NSTA, and the NCTM Commission on                        Standards for School Mathematics.  The major goals are to                       give students a deep understanding of content, an ability to                    solve problems in mathematics and science, and to enable them                   to become interested, active learners instead of passive                        consumers of knowledge.                                                                                                                                           CATALYST relies on resources from several institutions.                       These include intelligent problem solving tutors from URI;                      microworlds, inspectable simulations, repurposed videodisc                      and coaches from SFSU; and microcomputer based laboratory                       experiments from Tufts.                                                                                                                                           The total grant request from NSF is $1,035,500.  The                          institutions and their corporate sponsors have already                          committed $3,250,000 in matching resources and hardware,                        equal to 319% of the NSF award.",
