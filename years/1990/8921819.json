 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the study of the composition and                            taphonomy of Silurian and Devonian faunas Prince of Whales                      and Somerset Islands, Canada, together with the                                 sedimentology and petrology of the sediments to provide an                      overall view of the paleoecology and depositional settings                      of the vertebrate faunas.  The taphonomy will be studied to                     provide information about the extent to which the faunas                        have been transported and to aid understanding of the                           depositional environments in which they occur.  Results of                      the sedimentological and taphonomic studies will be                             integrated to provide a reconstruction of the environments                      in which the vertebrates lived.  This will then be compared                     with what is known of other vertebrate faunas of this age in                    an attempt to provide a better understanding of the                             environments inhabited by early vertebrates.  As many of the                    vertebrates studied belong to little known groups and as                        this area has previously been identified as an evolutionary                     center at this period it is expected that the phylogenetic                      implications of this work will be extensive.",
