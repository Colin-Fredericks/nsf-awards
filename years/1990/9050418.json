 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to introduce the use of lasers to the            instrumental analysis laboratory program at the College of Charleston.          The forefront of optical spectroscopic research involves the use of             lasers for both atomic and molecular spectroscopy.  The acquisition of          the equipment is allowing the establishment of a strong laser component         for the course.  The experiments being developed involve quantitative           molecular florescence, the quenching of one fluorescent molecule by             another, and thermal lens spectroscopy.  The modular approach to                construction of the three experiments is helping the students to better         understand the design of the experimental set-up.  An additional                benefit is the development of alternative projects to those that are            currently available in the department for undergraduate senior research         by expanding opportunities in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.                                                                                                The institution is matching the NSF grant with an equal amount of               funds.",
