Efforts           will be directed toward recruiting students who are women, minorities           and/or persons with disabilities; emphasis will be on selecting those           students who would not pursue this degree on their own.  Special efforts        will be directed toward motivating and recruiting well-qualified                undergraduate students with undergraduate training in engineering, the          physical sciences or mathematics to undertake PhD studies in the                engineering disciplines.  The special resources of the engineering              school will be combined with focused recruiting and support activities          to accomplish the goals of the program.",
