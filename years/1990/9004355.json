 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research performed under this award will include performance                evaluation and design for communication networks of the future,                 particularly large, high-speed optical networks.  The main topics               are 1) improved bounds and approximations for circuit-switched                  networks, 2) dynamic local routing strategies, 3) massively                     parallel switching algorithms, 4) optical interconnection patterns,             and 5) computation with unreliable components.  The approach                    includes modeling, analysis, and design.  The models will be based              on current and anticipated future technology and will cover the                 spectrum of networks from circuit-switched to datagram packet                   networks.  Analysis will consist of a mixture of exact                          probabilistic methods and simulation.  Design will be motivated by              modeling and analysis and aided by optimization tools of both                   combinatorial and nonlinear iterative types. Inequalities from                  information theory, mathematical physics, decision theory, and                  combinatorics will be applied to yield new performance bounds,                  providing a bridge between design and performance evaluation.",
