 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to study the effect                       of the extracellular reducing environment on the                                intracellular reduction state and to see how it affects the                     flow of metabolites.  The intracellular reduction state                         will be measured using culture fluorescence.  In general,                       NAD(P)H levels are known to regulate the particular pathway                     that is chosen over others in a multi-product fermentation                      and there is evidence that the extracellular redox                              potential affects the NAD(P)H level within cells.  It is                        hoped to exploit this phenomenon to control cells at a                          given intracellular reduction state and thus direct                             metabolic flow to one product in preference to others.  The                     external redox potential will be controlled by two                              different methods, one physical and the other chemical.                                                                                                         In addition to a better fundamental understanding of how                        NAD(P)H levels affect end-product formation, this study                         will help develop redox potential and culture fluorescence                      as online metabolic state sensors that will lead to novel                       bioreactor operating strategies for product optimization.",
