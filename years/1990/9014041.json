 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanisms by which endocytic vesicles form and by which                    vesicle formation is regulated are not understood in any                        biological system.  The proposed SGER is directed at                            understanding these phenomena by taking advantage of the                        temperature sensitive recessive mutation, shibire, in Drosophila.               At 30 degrees C coated visicle formation and endocytosis are                    stopped within 1-2 minutes in flies homozygous for the mutation.                Resumption of uptake occurs within 1-2 minutes after return to 22               degrees C.  Wild type Drosophila exhibit normal uptake and                      vesicle formation at both 22 and 30 degrees C.  Such rapid onset                and reversal in the mutants suggests that a protein                             intrinsic to vesicle formation is the target of the shibire                     mutation.  P element transposon mutagenesis will be used to                     identify and mark the wild type shibire gene.  Portions of the                  wild type shibire gene will then be used to identify and isolate                both genomic and cDNA clones of the wild type shibire gene.                                                                                                     Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an important step in the traffic               of cellular membranes and a fundamental cellular function that is               closely associated with the ability of cells to receive and                     respond to chemical signals.  If this project is successful it                  will be the first isolation of any gene involved in endocytic                   vesicle formation during receptor-mediated endocytosis.  This                   should then permit the identification, characterization, and                    localization of one or more of the cellular constituents which                  control this critical step in cellular membrane traffic.",
