 "awd_abstract_narration": "As households move among housing units, the geographic patterns of         metropolitan populations change.  Over time, these changes have                 profound impacts on the location of residents and of the services and           facilities that serve those residents.  Equally important, those                changes also alter the character and quality of the housing units               themselves.  Considerable attention has been focused by geographers and         other scholars on residential mobility from the perspective of                  households, but relatively little research has highlighted the ways in          which movements of households have affected housing units.  This                project will analyze mobility and related factors for ten American              metropolises using longitudinal data from the American Housing Survey           collected between 1974 and 1986.  The research will focus on two major          questions:  (1) How do patterns of residential mobility within                  metropolises change as the overall level of mobility changes? and (2)           What are the impacts of changing levels and patterns of mobility within         metropolises on the geographic distributions of residential                     populations?  Variables describing the mobility and demographic                 characteristics of households occupying housing units and of related            variables reflecting the constitution of housing submarkets will be fit         into a logit model in order to test a number of hypotheses related to           the two central questions.                                                           The results of this research will be significant from both                 scholarly and practical standpoints.  In terms of basic research, the           project will provide a firmer basis for understanding the relationship          between local mobility and the changing socioeconomic and demographic           patterns of populations within metropolises, and it will clarify the            relationship between households and housing units.  These new                   understandings will also provide a firmer foundation for analyses of            the evolving residential structure of specific cities, thereby enabling         civic leaders to better assess the possible impacts of various                  policies.",
