 "awd_abstract_narration": "Binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor triggers a             series of cellular events that culminate in cell division.                      Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at various sites has been observed          after exposure of cultured cells to EGF and other growth factors.  The          major site of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is threonine 669              Thr669).  Recently, a novel growth factor-stimulated threonine-protein          kinase, responsible for the phosphorylation of Thr669 has been purified         in Dr. Roger J. Davis' laboratory.  The research plan proposes the              large-scale purification of \"T669 protein kinase,\" the isolation and            cloning of its gene, and the development of antibodies against it, in           order to investigate the mechanism of activation of the novel kinase by         growth factors and its possible role in the transduction of mitogenic           signals.                                                                                                                                                        We will generate polyclonal antibodies to the kinase by injecting               purified enzyme into rabbits or chickens, and monoclonal antibodies by          injecting mice.  The antibodies will be used together with molecular            biology techniques in assays designed to investigate the mechanism by           which growth factors activate \"T669 protein kinase\" in signal                   transduction for mitogens.                                                                                                                                      The isolation of characterization of this novel growth factor-                  stimulated kinase could be very important for the elucidation of signal         transduction mechanisms for growth factors.  The regulation of kinases          activities has been realized to be a key process in growth control.",
