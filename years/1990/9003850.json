 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide logistical support for the launch of a                long duration balloon for the study of the isotopic composition of              heavy (iron group) cosmic rays.  The project is called MAGPIE:                  Magnetic Passive Isotope Experiment, and consists of special                    plastic sheets that can be etched to reveal tracks made by                      energetic cosmic rays.  The plastic is mounted in a strong                      magnetic field that is produced by a superconducting magnet.  The               experiment will determine the isotopic composition with                         unprecedented accuracy, and will thereby provide information on                 the elemental makeup of the galaxy and the stellar processes which              produce all of the heavier elements.                                                                                                                            Due to the high geomagnetic latitude of Antarctica these fairly                 low energy heavy ions will reach the atmosphere in much larger                  numbers than they would at mid-latitudes.  This, combined with the              lack of diurnal heating and cooling of the balloon, because of the              constant sunshine during the polar summer, makes long duration                  ballooning in Antarctica for cosmic ray research very attractive.                                                                                               The funds for the researchers and the launch of the balloon will                be provided by NASA.  NSF will provide logistical support and the               recovery of the payload.//",
