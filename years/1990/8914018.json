 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas Croat has completed a taxonomic monograph                       describing the section Pachyneurium of the genus Anthurium, the                 most diverse genus of the Araceae.  Aroids vary from small plants               to woody shrubs, and they can be very difficult to distinguish at               the level of speceis.  Section Pachyneurium extends throughout                  Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean, but its                   greatest diversity is exhibited from Costa Rica to Peru.  Dr.                   Croat has studied the group over a twenty year period with                      research support from the Systematic Biology Program of the                     National Science Foundation.  He now proposes publication in the                Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden of a descriptive                        treatment of the group.  This publication series has been one of                the world's most influential sources of information on the                      taxonomy and distribution of tropical plant species.                                 The proposed monograph publication will find a wide audience               among systematic botanists, tropical ecologists, biogeographers,                and evolutionary biologists.  Tropical species far outnumber                    their temperate counterparts, and monographs such as Dr. Croat's                are critical for identifying species and pursuing any further                   research on them.  Descriptive taxonomic research such as this is               the first step toward unravelling the factors contributing to the               extraordinary diversity of tropical species.",
