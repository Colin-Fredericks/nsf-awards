 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the development of a novel                       competitive association method for determining association                      constants for very weak molecular complexes from  measured                      solute solubility and chromatographic partition coefficients                    in binary solvent mixtures.  Research efforts will be focused                   in five areas.  First, a systematic study will be made of the                   solubility and spectroscopic properties of carbazole,                           phenoxazine and phenothiazine dissolved in a large number of                    binary solvent mixtures.                                                                                                                                        Second, the competitive association model will be extended to                   include ternary solvent systems in order to assess the effect                   that a third inert cosolvent has on the calculated association                                                                                                  parameters.  Third, gas-liquid chromatographic methods and                      partition coefficients will be used to test the applications                    and limitations of the derived competitive association model.                                                                                                   Fourth, the basic thermodynamic mixing model will be extended                   to excess volumes of ternary associated nonelectrolyte                          solutions.  Finally, the basic thermodynamic model will be                      extended to tautomeric solute molecules.",
