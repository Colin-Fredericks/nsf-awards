The funds will provide stipends for 150                    outstanding high school teachers of science who wish to do an                   independent research project on topics which connect science                    with other fields such as history of science, science and                       society, science and ethics and science and the environment.                    The teachers will be selected through a competitive national                    search process, provided summer stipends and paired with a                      mentor who has done scholarly work in the proposed field of                     study. Fellows will be selected on the basis of a submitted                     plan which describes the topics to be explored, explains the                    strategy for applying the results across disciplines and                        shows evidence of a collegial relationship with fellow                          teachers in other disciplines so that the likelihood of                         disemination will be enhanced. The independent study project                    must satisfy the criteria required by the Council for Basic                     Education for academic rigor and cross-disciplinary links.                      The Council for Basic Education will monitor each Fellow's                      progress throughout the study period and evaluate the                           effectiveness of the fellowship project in the classroom. The                   NSF grant of $600,000 will be matched by $406,029 from the                      Council                                                                         for Basic Education. This is a matching amount which exceeds 67%.",
