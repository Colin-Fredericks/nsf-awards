 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year, full-time award enables a new PhD in anthropologyto              develop her understanding of the scientific approaches to                       management of natural resources, specifically oyster reefs.  She                will undertake a one-year course of study in the Department of                  Wildlife and Fisheries Management at Texas A&M University,                      sponsored by Dr. David J. Schmidly, Head of the Department.                     Attending classes with future regulatory employees, she will learn              about the scientific models on which resource management is based,              including oyster biology, population dynamics, economics, growth,               habitat and histories of local reefs.  At the same time, field work             in the Galveston Bay area among oyster fishermen will focus on                  elucidating the elements of indigenous models -- the local                      knowledge fishermen use in managing their resource.                             Anthropological literature has shown that fishermen often have                  models for self-regulation which are not apparent to regulatory                 agencies or to scientists.  Bureaucrats often introduce management              regimes with the assumption that fishermen have no management                   system (formal or informal) or use one that must be ineffective                 since it is not based on scientific information.  This project                  hypothesizes that 1) adverse socio-economic impacts from the                    institution of rationalized management will be lessened if existing             informal management systems are, where possible, incorporated, and              2) both types of management models must be explicit for this to                 happen.  The project goal is to enable scientists to incorporate                appropriate indigenous strategies and to give fishermen a voice in              management of their local resources.                                                                                                                            This project addresses a central issue in both theory and practice              in science studies:  the relationship between formalized,                       scientific ways of knowing and the informal experience-based                    methods by which communities negotiate priorities and practices.                The investigator and her host specialist and host institution are               uniquely well-qualified to undertake and support this project;                  research and related activities are likely to continue after the                period of the award.  Results are likely to be appropriately                    disseminated and useful.  An award in the amount of $28,000 is                  therefore recommended.",
