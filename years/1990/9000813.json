 "awd_abstract_narration": "An REU site is continued.  Research support is awarded to motivated             and academically superior engineering undergraduates in their junior            and senior year.  The program has both the summer and academic year             components.  At least three of the eight REU participants will be               selected for summer participation from applicants from colleges and             universities other than Syracuse University.  A particular focus of             recruitment effort will be to attract participants from women,                  minority and disabled student groups.  For the current (1989-90) REU            project, two of the eight participants were minority students and one           of the minority participant was a woman.  Seven faculty members in the          mechanical and aerospace engineering Department have expressed                  interest in supervising the research efforts of the REU participants.           The areas in which the faculty members are actively engaged in                  research span experimental and computational fluid mechanics,                   gasdynamics, aerodynamics, heat transfer, helicopter aerodynamics and           aeroelastic stability, aeroacoutics, noise control, automotive                  engineering, paper technology and robotics.  A REU participant may              select research problem in any one of these research areas of interest          to him or her.                                                                  * The expected profile and the accomplishments of the REU participants          for the current (1989-90) project are outlined under \"Results from              Prior NSF Support\" in the Narrative pp.9-12, with additional details            in Appendix VI, pp. 16-21.  The profile of the REU participants for             1990-92 is outline under item 16. (pp. IX-X).                                   ** Under the research interests of each faculty supervisor, some                typical research problems to be suggested to REU participants are               listed in the Narrative (pp. 3-9).",
