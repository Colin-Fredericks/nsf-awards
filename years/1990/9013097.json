 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Patricia McAnany, professor of                       anthropology at Boston University, Mr. Daniel Finamore will                     conduct archaeological research to collect data for his doctoral                dissertation.  His work will focus on the New River Valley of                   coastal Belize and include the excavation of a series of logging                camps occupied during the eighteenth century.  Coastal Belize was               settled primarily by English seafarers and was a colony of Great                Britain.  Although originally egalitarian, an economically                      stratified community developed and this process was furthered by                the importation of black slaves.  The economy of the colony                     depended largely on logging, and tropical wood was harvested and                shipped to Europe.  As coastal supplies diminished, the focus                   shifted inland, and canals were dug to permit trees to be floated               to rivers and hence to the coast.  To this end, inland camps were               established.  Mr. Finamore is interested in these because he                    believes they will shed light on the relationships and economic                 interactions between different colonial groups.  Camps differ in                nature.  Some were occupied primarily by slaves and others by                   small or large property holders.  Mr. Finamore has located a                    series of sites based on English documents, and he plans to                     excavate a sample to collect and note variation in material                     culture.  This in turn will shed light on different lifestyles                  and interactions among groups.                                                                                                                                  This research is important for several reasons.  It will shed                   additional light on a little known period of Middle American                    prehistory.  It will also increase our understanding of long-                   term, inter-ethnic interactions in frontier situations.  Similar                highly volatile contexts still exist today in areas such as                     Amazonian Brazil and the Philippines, and the results of Mr.                    Finamore's work will be directly relevant to our understanding of               them.  Finally, the project will further the training of an                     extremely promising young scientist.",
