 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                               Organometallic Chemistry Program Dr. Steven H. Strauss will                     synthesize negatively charged ions (anions) designed to form                    extremely weak bonds with the positively charged ions (cations)                 of metals. The metal salts of such anions are expected to have                  unusually high reactivities, so that they can be used to                        prepare adducts of metals which cannot be made by any other                     route.                                                                                                                                                          The goal of the project is to understand the solvation of metal                 ions by very weak donor solvents such as chlorocarbons and                      hydrocarbons. Metal salts of perfluorinated oxyanions such as                   oxopentafluorotellurate(VI) and dioxotetrafluorotellurate(VI),                  and extremely large perfluorinated anions such as tetrakis-                     (oxopentafluorotellurato)borate will be prepared. By virtue of                  the electronic and steric properties of the anions, the metal                   ions will be rendered extremely reactive and are expected to                    coordinate to very weakly basic solvents such as methylene                      chloride, nitromethane, hexane and liquid xenon. New synthetic                  methodologies will be developed for the preparation, isolation                  and structural and spectroscopic characterization of metal                      complexes containing weakly nucleophilic, weakly bound, and                     volatile solvent ligands. Complexes of paramagnetic transition                  metals and lanthanide ions will be prepared. The coordination                   of solvent molecules to a variety of metal ions in neat solvent                 will be studied by EXAFS spectroscopy. Potential applications                   of the reactive complexes to metalized polymers and new                         metastable phases of metal salts will be explored.",
