 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research by Drs. Peter Pesch and Nicholas                   Sanduleak based on observations made with Case Western Reserve                  University's Burrell Schmidt telescope, located on Kitt Peak in                 Arizona, and with the Curtis Schmidt, located at Cerro Tololo                   Inter-American Observatory.  The principal survey now being                     carried out is a very fruitful search for faint blue and/or                     emission line galaxies, quasi-stellar objects with and without                  emission features, probable blue stars, main-sequence late B and                A stars, Population II stars of types A and F, F and G subdwarfs,               and faint carbon and late M type stars.  Exploratory observations               with a charge coupled device on the Burrell Schmidt are planned                 to determine what direct and spectroscopic observational                        programs would be worthwhile to undertake.                                                                                                                      Investigations of galactic structure and the distribution of                    extragalactic objects require surveys to identify the objects                   which will be studied in detail.  Surveys over large parts of the               sky are especially important for studies of the population                      distribution in our galaxy to determine the different                           characteristics towards the nucleus, halo and anticenter.  The                  surveys conducted by these researchers at Case Western are a                    vital first step to detailed follow-on investigations.",
