 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the emergence,                       operation, and evolution of non-market institutions which arose                 in Genoa and England during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.               Two types of transactions central to trade and trade efficiency                 will be analyzed.  The first transaction to be examined is the                  provision of the services required in handling goods abroad,                    while the second transaction is the organization of the                         provisions governing exchange of goods abroad (e.g., credit                     arrangements).  Neither transaction could be organized through                  the anonymous market nor supervised by the legal system in these                two historical episodes.  An extensive documentary search will be               conducted in order to identify the nature of the institutions                   that governed these transactions.  To facilitate the empirical                  research, asymmetric information models of the organizational                   problems associated with these transactions will be constructed.                This research is important because the study departs from a long                tradition in economic history that emphasized the contribution of               the market mechanism to European growth.  Thus, this research may               shed important new light on the European development process                    which will enhance our understanding of the transition from less                developed to more developed economies in general.",
