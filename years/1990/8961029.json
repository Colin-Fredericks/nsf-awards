 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quality of plant products which have been frozen for                        storage can be compromised by the damaging effects of ice                       growth within the frozen tissue.  A number of proteins have                     been identified which can inhibit ice crystal growth when                       present in very low concentrations.  We will study  a gene for                  one of these proteins cloned into plants.  In addition, the                     gene will be modified so that the protein it codes for is                       larger and more easily detected (by fusion to protein A from                    Staphylococcus aureus), and is secreted from plant cells (by                    the attachment of secretion signal sequences).  The ability of                  the transformed plants to express and localise the fusion                       proteins will be determined.   Simple assays which measure the                  damage caused by ice crystal growth in frozen plant tissue will                 be used to assess the ability of the protein to protect against                 this damage.  This approach offers a novel way of improving the                 quality of frozen fruits and vegetables, and increasing the                     range of fruits and vegetables that can be successfully frozen.",
