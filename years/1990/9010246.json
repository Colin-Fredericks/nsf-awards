 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key assumption in traditional game theory is that all players are             completely rational.  This sometimes leads to absurd conclusions.               One part of this project is to continue exploring the implications              of more evolution-based hypotheses about behavior in games.  Within             economic theory, three problems are addressed.  First, recent                   strategic-game models of the problems associated with the massive               debt owed by certain sovereign nations to private commercial banks              have yielded provocative but counterfactual predictions.  The goal              here is to see whether the results change.  Second, in some                     economic games a counterintutive theoretical result has emerged:                that more competition on one side of a market leads to a price                  change in the wrong direction.  The intention here is to explore                the general class of market games in which this phenomenon arises.              Third, adopting the view that government decision-making is a                   complicated ongoing bargaining process involving competing and                  overlapping constituencies, bargains struck at one point in time                necessarily have implications for what will confront future                     bargainers; yet there is no way that compromises can be agreed to               by the as-yet-nonexistent players.  The aim here is to explore the              extent of the social inefficiencies that inevitably result.                                                                                                     The research on evolution and bounded rationality in games is                   especially exciting.  One of the major problems with bounded                    rationality is modeling the limitations on rationality in a way                 that is not arbitrary or only descriptive.  In this project                     economic agents use a variety of rules of thumb for bounded                     rationality reasons.  These rules are applied across a number of                different social situations and evolutionary processes.  The                    frequencies of the specific rules found in a society are derived.               For instance, one might imagine that in a society in which the rule             of thumb \"avoid risky investments\" was widely practiced, the                    prospects for high payoff (at least temporarily) from more                      aggressive strategies might be better on average than in other                  societies, although not in all situations.  This in turn might lead             to an invasion of such strategies and the subsequent relative                   success in turn of more conservative strategies.  This project                  develops analytic tools that permit us to determine under what                  conditions a steady state with a blend of behaviors comes about and             under what conditions perpetual periodic waves occur.",
