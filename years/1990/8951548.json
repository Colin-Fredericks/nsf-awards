 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Microbiology at The              University of Massachusetts, Amherst to purchase equipment which                will help introduce modern analytical techniques into the teaching              of microbial physiology in two undergraduate laboratory courses.                Gas chromatographic techniques will be used to measure the products             of microbial metabolism.  The new approach provides for the                     development of laboratory exercises in fermentation, growth and                 nitrogen fixation.  The products of microbial metabolism to be                  analyzed include short-chain fatty acids and alcohols, hydrogen,                and carbon dioxide.  In addition, the developments will include the             capacity to measure ethylene produced as a result of the activity               of nitrogenase.  The use of a table top fermentor also allows for               investigations into the rates of metabolic processes and an                     examination of those variables (e.g. pH and temperature) that                   control metabolic processes.  The  improvement will overcome many               of the limitations currently experienced in undergraduate                       microbiology courses.  The grantee is matching this award with non-             Federal sources.",
