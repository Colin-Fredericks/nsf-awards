 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant hormone auxin is required for many aspects of plant                   development.  Auxin appears to stimulate cell elongation and cell               division in intact plants.  Auxin is thought to be essential for plant          cell growth because it is absolutely required for growth of plant cells         in culture.  Despite its importance, very little is known about the             mechanism of auxin action.  This research proposes to better determine          the molecular details of how auxin regulates cellular events as a basis         for understanding auxin regulation of development at the level of the           whole plant.                                                                                                                                                    The focus of this research is Arabidopsis thaliana because it is                particularly well suited to both molecular and classical genetic                studies.  Genes involved in auxin action will be identified from                mutants which do not respond normally to applied auxin.  One of the             mutants isolated in this way is called auxin resistant 1 or axr1.               Certain axr1 mutant plants have been characterized in the PI's                  laboratory and the mutants display a number of defects which suggest            defective auxin responses.  The AXR1 gene will be cloned and the                nucleotide sequence determined.  Genetic studies have shown that the            gene lies on chromosome one, very close to a previously isolated                fragment of DNA.  This fragment of DNA will be used to isolate the AXR1         gene using a technique called chromosome walking.  Once cloned, the             gene will be introduced into axr1 mutant plants using plant                     transformation procedures developed for Arabidopsis.  Loss of auxin             resistance in the transformed plants will confirm that the AXR1 gene            has been correctly cloned.  The DNA sequence of the AXR1 gene will be           determined and used to deduce the amino acid sequence of the gene               product and will be compared with the sequences of other previously             isolated genes.  The isolated gene will also allow determination of             which cells in the plant are making the AXR1 gene product.  The                 molecular characterization of the AXR1 gene should lead to important            new insights into the role of auxin in plant development.",
