 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for even simple behaviors to occur, nerve cells must                   communicate with other nerve cells in the brain, as well as with                specific targets throughout the body.  This communication is                    primarily achieved via chemical messengers called hormones or                   neurotransmitters.  One of the most challenging problems in                     neurobiology is to understand how the electrical activity of a                  nerve cell is transformed into these chemical signals which are                 then secreted or released to act on other nerve cells or targets                throughout the body.  Dr. Lemos has developed a cell system to                  directly examine the sites where this transduction takes place.                 He will record electrical activity from isolated nerve terminals                of neuroendocrine structures and compare this activity to                       patterns observed in the body of the cell.  Using state of the                  art patch-clamp methodology, Dr. Lemos will determine how                       particular ionic currents control the release of neuroactive                    substances from the nerve terminals.  These results will lead to                a better understanding of how neuronal information is encoded and               communicated to other cells.  Deciphering how ion channels                      influence secretion not only enhances our basic knowledge but                   could lead to the development of new therapeutic agents targeted                at the level of the nerve cell terminals for the treatment of                   diseases of the nervous system.",
