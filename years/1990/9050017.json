 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wyoming project is to develop and test a                      model for improving the mathematics education of preservice                     teachers. The model project will develop a program based upon                   the research-documented teaching strategies of the learning                     cycle and the use of cooperative groups.  The content                           decisions will be guided by the NCTM Curriculum and                             Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.  The intent of                     the program is to educate teachers for the elementary schools                   that will be able to implement the NCTM Standards into their                    elementary school classrooms. This includes attention to the                    content to be taught and to the restructuring of the                            classroom environment in such a way that students will be                       able to construct deeper understanding of the mathematics                       studied.                                                                                                                                                        One of the major goals of the project is that the graduates                     understand many connections between the content of                              mathematics and science as well as the related pedagogies.                      The students will have a content/methods/practicum/student                      teaching sequence which will involve experienced teachers                       that have been educated to be mentors in mathematics and                        science.  The science and mathematics faculty is working with                   the education faculty and public school teachers and                            principals to develop, test, revise, and institutionalize the                   program.                                                                                                                                                        Communication, problem solving, reasoning, searching for                        patterns and valuing mathematics will be overall themes for                     the mathematics course development.  The content selected                       will be organized into activities and problems that will                        allow the development of these ways of thinking and reasoning                   in mathematics.  New content emphases will be included in the                   courses, for example, decision making under uncertainty which                   will use many science contexts for investigation.                                                                                                               The learning cycle model of teaching has been developed in                      science education.  However, it is consistent with                              constructivist views of learning.  The phases that are                          emphasized in the learning cycle are 1) motivating the study                    (introduction), 2) exploration, 3) concept development, 4)                      application, 5) and problem extension.  The students in this                    project will meet the learning cycle in their science courses                   as well as their mathematics courses.  This consistency of                      language and purpose will help build coherence in the way                       these preservice teachers think of teaching both mathematics                    and science.  The learning cycle approach will be enhanced by                   the use of group work in college mathematics courses.                                                                                                           The University cost sharing is 78% of the amount contributed                    by NSF.",
