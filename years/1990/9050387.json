 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-year sequence of laboratory and field experiences in                      hydrogeology is being developed with the aid of new laboratory, field,          and computing equipment. An integrated experience is being developed in         which students use a piece of field or laboratory equipment to collect          data. They are then given a data set from a hazardous waste site and            asked to interpret these data. Computers are used to store and process          the data and to model the waste site. Exercises include grain size              analysis of sediments, interpreting gamma logs and geologists' logs to          make geological cross-sections, measurements of water levels and                construction of water table maps and well hydrographs, performance of           slug tests and analysis of results, aquifer test analysis, collection           of water samples from wells and construction of contaminant                     distribution plumes, stream gauging, conducting and interpreting                results of electromagnetic surveys, and development of computer models          from ground water flow, contaminant transport and capture zone                  analysis. The final project is the preparation of a report summarizing          the year's work. The university will contribute an amount equal to the          award.",
