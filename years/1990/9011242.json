 "awd_abstract_narration": "The motivation for research on self-propagating high                            temperature synthesis (solid combustion) has been largely                       based upon materials considerations, but many of the                            unresolved problems are directly or indirectly related to heat                  and mass transfer issues.  Temperature-related wave                             characteristics are governed, in part, by the thermal                           conductivity, diffusivity, and specific heat of the reactants                   and products of combustion.  The research, which is to be                       performed cooperatively with the Institute of Structural                        Macrokinetics in Chernogolovka, USSR, consists of three                         experimental activities:  investigations of the effect of                       melting on combustion synthesis of refractory metal carbides,                   investigations of nonuniform combustion fronts in the                           filtration combustion synthesis of nitrides, and investigation                  of the propagation of combustion waves through compositional                    gradients.                                                                                                                                                      Fundamental studies are needed to provide a thorough                            understanding of the mechanisms of direct combustion                            synthesis.  The apparent complexity of the process has                          generated only a reserved optimism on the future of the                         technique with US industry.  A research effort coordinated                      with the Soviet Union, under the guidelines of the US-USSR                      Cooperation in the Field of Basic Scientific Research Program,                  will lead to a higher likelihood of understanding the                           combustion process in synthesis reactions through                               investigations of the evolving temperature wave.",
