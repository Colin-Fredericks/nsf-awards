 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two problems have cause the American manufacturing industries to                weaken.  First, manufacturing enterprises are not operated as                   integrated systems.  Second, manufacturing operations are still                 short of scientific approaches.  Issues of the science and the                  integration of manufacturing systems must be carefully reviewed in              manufacturing education.  The study of \"Computer Integrated                     Manufacturing\" is intended to address the problems.                                                                                                             This project utilizes computing and networking equipment and                    software to refine the existing Computer Integrated Manufacturing               (CIM) Laboratory.   Operation with Local Area Networks permits                  connection to mainframe, mini and micro computers.  Activities in               this lab include CAD/CAM/CAE.  This enables the manufacturing                   students to see how their previous courses interact with each                   other.  This lab introduces the picture of a continuous network                 within a CIM system.  Problems of integration, methodologies of                 implementation, and standardization in manufacturing are                        demonstrated.                                                                                                                                                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
