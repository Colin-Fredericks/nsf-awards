Special encouragement and support of the             students will be provided by the project director and two specially             selected outstanding engineering faculty members (mentors) in addition          to the support provided by each student's major professor.  The director        and mentors will recruit the students, will meet regularly with them,           will monitor their progress, and will offer help and guidance relative          to the students' personal and career development.",
