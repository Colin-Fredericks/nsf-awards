 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to characterize the  11 desaturases of the                    cabbage looper moth.  Specifically, the DNA sequence of the                     gene for this enzyme will be determined and compared with                       similar sequences isolated from desaturase genes in other                       moth species.  It is intended subsequently to extend this                       work to examine the  10 desaturases in primitive lepidoptera                    and then to move on to other genes that encode other enzymes                    involved in pheromone biosynthesis.                                                                                                                             Sex pheromones are chemical compounds that play a crucial                       role in insect reproduction.  Major components of these                         pheromones are synthesized in female sex pheromone glands.                      In this research the principal investigators build on                           detailed knowledge of pheromone biochemistry by addressing                      the structure and regulation of the genes encoding these                        enzymes.  The work employs new techniques of molecular                          biology and should considerably broaden our present horizons                    about the pheromone communication system so as to provide a                     basis for gene manipulation in connection with novel insect                     control strategies.***//",
