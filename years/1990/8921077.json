 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theoretical treatment of atomic and molecular systems has                   benefited greatly in the past thirty years from the development                 and evolution of high speed computing facilities.  In                           particular, with the help of computers, scientists are now able                 to explore the myriad implications of the quantum theory and                    statistical mechanics, and analyze much more completely the                     information derived from experiements.  As a result, we                         scientists are much closer to realizing the eventual goal of                    being able to understand and predict the structure, dynamics,                   and reactivity of atoms and molecules.  Electronic structure                    theory has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the                         increased capacity and speed present in modern computers.                                                                                                       This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will aid the Chemistry Department at the University of Nevada -                 Reno purchase a mini-supercomputer.  This computer will be used                 in the following research areas of study:                                                                                                                       1.  Electron Impact Ionization                                                  2.  Properties of Doubly Excited States                                         3.  The Effects of Rotation on Vibrational Mixing                               4.  Quantum Dynamics and Non Adiabatic Processes                                5.
