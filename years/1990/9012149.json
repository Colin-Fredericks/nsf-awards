 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have long speculated that the measured (income)                      returns to education may reflect the correlation of schooling                   levels with other variables related to earnings, such as ability.                                                                                               There have been many attempts over the years to estimate the                    return to education without bias from omitted variables that are                correlated with educational attainment and with earnings                        capacity. If education were randomly assigned, the returns to                   education would be consistently measured simply by comparing the                earnings of more and less educated individuals. In the absence of               random assignment, the omitted variable bias can be overcome by                 using instrumental variables that are correlated with education                 but have no other effect on earnings. This project uses Vietnam-                era draft lottery categories to derive an instrument for years of               education in a wage equation. As a consequence of the lottery,                  the risk of induction was randomly assigned on the basis of                     individuals' birthdays. Because it was necessary for young men                  seeking to avoid the draft to take draft avoidance measures                     (e.g. school attendance) before the cutoff lottery number for the               draft was actually known, the lottery has an influence on years                 of schooling that differs from its influence on induction.                                                                                                      A second project uses variations in educational attainment by                   season of birth to estimate the returns to education. It is                     suggested that compulsory schooling laws -- which typically                     mandate school attendance until age 16 -- interact with age at                  school entry to produce a season of birth effect on education.                                                                                                  Resolution of this issue is of substantial importance for                       education policy and economic theory. As the average incomes of                 high school and college graduates continues to diverge, it is                   vital to understand more about the relationship between schooling               and earnings.",
