Support is being provided for the continued effort of making ADMI an            effective instrument to further the interest of minority institutions           and the National Science Foundation in strengthening computer                   science/engineering academic and research programs and increasing the           number of minority students selecting CISE supported areas as                   faculty/research careers.  Support is being provided during this                formative period of ADMI for meetings of the organization's elected             officers and Advisory Board, and other projects until strategies are            developed to provide long term self-sufficiency.  Immediate support is          for three board meetings, the 90 Annual National ADMI meeting, and              three proposal writing one-day workshops to be held in Baltimore, MD            (Morgan State University); Houston, TX (The University of Houston);             and Davis, CA (DQ University).",
