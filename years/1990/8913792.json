Large-scale optimization has received renewed                    interest and importance over the last ten years due to the                      research of Soviet and United States mathematicians working on                  interior-point and special-structure methods, and the                           introduction of parallel computers.  This seminar series will                   enable the two research communities to become updated in each                   others work and pave the way for future cooperative research in                 the development of new procedures and their application.  A two-                seminar series is scheduled.  The first will be held in College                 Park and the second in Moscow.",
