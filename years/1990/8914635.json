 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the vast floral diversity of the orchid family                       (Orchidaceae), the four genera of the slipper orchids (subfamily                Cypripedioideae) stand out as an easily defined assemblage.                     Their stereotyped flowers, adapted for pollination by temporarily               trapping insects in their pitcher-like lips, nevertheless exhibit               a secondary level of floral modifications attractive to a wide                  variety of pollinators.  Because the floral parts of slipper                    orchids are so similar for functional reasons, only shape and                   color become available as criteria for establishing relationships               based on flowers.  Structure of the plant body itself offers                    little more data, the most recent work on this subject dating to                1966.  Chloroplast DNA analysis, which has proven helpful in                    resolving relationships in other orchids and plant groups, will                 be applied to the slipper orchids in hopes of uncovering numerous               characters (mutations in the DNA) that can be used to assess                    relationships more reliably.  Chloroplast DNA exists separate                   from the chromosomal DNA that codes for plant and flower                        development, so it should serve as an excellent internal                        indicator of relationships in a stereotyped orchid group for                    which such external features are difficult to define and relate                 to one another.  Characters of the plant and flower parts will be               studied relative to the relationships uncovered with chloroplast                DNA analysis in hopes of understanding more about their                         evolution.  Additional features of the plants will also be                      examined for comparison to the molecular work, including external               sculpturing of the seed walls.                                                       Following the work on evolutionary relationships of the                    slipper orchids, their geographic history will be traced.  The                  slipper orchids display an unusual distribution, and no formal                  studies of this arrangement have yet been undertaken.  This                     research will no doubt be aided by knowledge of the genetic                     relationships (by chloroplast DNA) of the plants in question.  No               fossil record exists for the Cypripedioideae, and it is hoped                   that by studying current distributions with respect to past                     continental movements, an approximate time and place of their                   origin may be obtained.  An additional aim of this study will be                an attempt to understand an evolutionary mechanism that may be                  responsible for some of the diversity seen in the slipper                       orchids.  Changes in the timing of events that occur during the                 development of a plant can have drastic consequences for the                    final shape and size of both plant and floral parts.  A system of               two similar species of Mexican slipper orchids will be studied                  for such changes.  One species appears to be a juvenile version                 of the other; this hypothesis will be tested by comparing shapes                of flower parts in buds and open flowers of both species and by                 comparing the relative rates of growth of the two flowers.",
