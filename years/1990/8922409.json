 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Daniel E. Murnick of Rutgers University                 to collaborate in physics research with Dr. Andreas Ulrich of the               Physics Department of the Technical University of Munich.  They                 will study the optical emission from matter excited by heavy ion                beams, with the goal of developing new short wavelength lasers.                 New spectroscopy in the vacuum ultraviolet region, from heavy ion               beam pumped gases, will be studied with measureable gain possible               on selected transitions.  Planning and experimental design will                 take place both in the U.S. and West Germany.  Experiments will                 be conducted at the GSI heavy ion accelerator facility in                       Darmstadt, West Germany, which has unique capabilities for these                studies.  Data analysis and evaluation will also be carried out                 in both countries.  Reciprocal visits will facilitate both the                  experimental and the analytical phases of the project.                                                                                                          Heavy ion beam pumping provides a laser excitation technique                    which is potentially significant for producing short wavelength                 high power lasers.  The study of the physics of the excited state               formation and decay until now has been the most important area of               current research.  Recent accelerator advances now allow the                    production of very intensive, well focused beams which are useful               both for heavy ion inertial confinement fusion and short wavelength             laser physics research.  The proposed collaboration will use a                  unique new heavy ion synchrotron, the SIS, just completed in                    Darmstadt, West Germany, to probe exciting new potential short                  wavelength laser physics and sources.  The research should lead                 to important new fundamental results, through the discovery and                 study of new physics of heavy ion interactions in dense plasmas.",
