Entitled \"Science and Mathematics Enrichment for the Disabled\" (SMED),          this project provides students with physical disabilities -- including          mobility impairments, visual impairments, chronic illness, and profound         deafness -- with exposure to technical career options and the skills            needed for success in technological fields.  Students selected for this         program have superior academic ability but most come from special               schools, segregated by disability, where technical courses are                  downgraded and there is little or no science.  Follow-up includes a             Spring reunion at NJIT, sharing materials used in SMED with school              teachers and sending science activities and mathematics problems to the         students.",
