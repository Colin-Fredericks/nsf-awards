 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental studies in laboratory animals have demonstrated               that bony morphology responds ontogenetically to behavioral                     modification.  The scapula, in particular, has been shown to be                 very plastic during growth.  Locomotor behavior often changes                   with increase in body size, and it is well known that locomotor                 behavior of the gorilla changes with ontogeny.  Thus, this study                is designed to investigate ontogenetic shape change in the                      scapula of two subspecies of gorilla, the largest extant primate.                    Scapular shape will be assessed both by traditional linear                 measurements and by shape indices.  Nearly 400 scapulae from                    several museums will be studied.  Tensor biometrics will also be                used to assess scapular shape independent of size, and                          multivariate tests will be used to test for differences between                 male and female and for age-related differences.  The results of                this comparative study will be useful for making predictions                    about locomotor behavior which can then be tested in the wild.",
