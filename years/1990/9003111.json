 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research grant will support an anthropology                   graduate student investigating peasant responses to state                       divestment and reprivatization of the Mexican sugar industry.                   The Mexican state recently sold the majority of its sugar mills                 to national and transnational corporations, thus weakening the                  relationship between the cane producers unions and the state.                   The research will examine how this divestment affects local                     peasant producers.  Hypotheses to be tested are that credit will                be distributed more unevenly, socioeconomic differentiation will                increase in general, local level decision making over production                will decrease, and that the state will mediate between unions and               mill owners.  Methods include a census of one village,                          participant observation of producers, unions, and mills,                        structured interviews, oral histories, archival data.                                                                                                           This research is important because it will help us understand the               strategies rural producers adopt in the face of changes in                      corporate ownership of economic institutions.  This knowledge is                critical to the resolution of political unrest attendant on                     increased societal problems associated with debt restructuring in               the Third World.",
