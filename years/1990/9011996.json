 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research plan is proposed which will result in a thorough                     evaluation of absorption power cycles and a methodology for                     designing optimum power cycles.  The research will                              specifically focus on power cycles operating with low                           temperature heat sources, such as solar or geothermal energy,                   or the energy rejected from higher temperature cycles.  The                     utility of the universal efficiency concept, as a model                         leading to economically sound power cycle designs, will first                   be evaluated.  According to the universal efficiency concept,                   the maximum power of simple cycles subject to heat transfer                     irreversibilities may be explicitly determined.  The effect of                  additional thermodynamic irreversibilities on the efficiency                    at maximum power will be examined with the intent to develop a                  realistic goal for the efficiency of well-designed power                        cycles.  A detailed evaluation of several absorption power                      cycles will be made by comparing their first and operating                      costs with those of conventional power cycles.  Particular                      attention will be paid to absorption power cycles in which                      energy transfers to and from the cycle involve streams having                   finite thermal capacitance rates.  The comparisons will                         include a consideration of realistic parasitic losses.  It is                   clear that heat exchange is of primary importance in the                        design of optimized cycles.  Heat exchanger network synthesis                   methods will be used to identify improved power cycles designs                  and to establish a general methodology for designing these                      cycles.",
