 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computational demands of modern chemical research require                   the proper computing system that would avoid wasteful                           bottlenecks by balancing a variety of computational                             capabilities with individual workstations, networks, hardware                   and software maintenance, support personnel and training in all                 areas of computational chemistry.  Many new insights into the                   kinetics of chemical reactions can be developed through                         theoretical studies with use of mini-supercomputers when the                    experimental data are inaccessible.  In addition, the most                      cost-effective computers are the mini-supercomputers.                                                                                                           This award will allow the Department of Chemistry at the                        University of Michigan to acquire a mini-supercomputer system.                  The research studies to be performed include the following:                                                                                                     1) Ab initio calculations of molecular properties.                                                                                                              2) Monte Carlo simulations of energy transport and reaction                        kinetics in condensed phases and on surfaces as models                          thereof.                                                                                                                                                     3) Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics calculations of                              nucleation kinetics and structure of molecular clusters.                                                                                                     4) Development of new ab initio methods for reaction dynamics.                                                                                                  5) Molecular modeling to elucidate structures determined by                        X-ray crystallography and by microwave and NMR spectroscopy.                                                                                                 6) Analysis of complex spectral data, i.e. for hyperfine                           interactions, barriers to internal motions, 2-D NMR, etc.                                                                                                    7) Graphical analyses of the results of these and other studies.",
