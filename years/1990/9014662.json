 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is the chemistry of transition                 metal cluster compounds, which constitute an important class of                 industrial catalysts. The project is expected to provide a                      better understanding of the way in which such clusters are                      assembled and of the transformations of organic molecules bound                 to the clusters.                                                                                                                                                Two important areas of metal cluster chemistry will be                          addressed: ligand transformations on clusters and the synthesis                 of new types of mixed-metal clusters.  In the former area the                   recent finding of ways to split the C-O bond of the CCO ligand                  will be exploited. The mechanism of this reaction will be                       studied, and the cleavage of the C-O bond will be utilized to                   synthesize a variety of new substituted acetylide ligands bound                 to three-metal clusters. These ligands will permit systematic                   studies of the very large substituent effects on C-C cleavage                   reactions for substituted acetylene ligands bound to metal                      clusters. Cluster building reactions based on the cleavage of                   the C-O bond should provide a new route to clusters containing                  C2 moieties. In the second area of metal cluster research, the                  synthesis and physical characterization of new types of early-                  late transition metal cluster compounds will be explored.",
