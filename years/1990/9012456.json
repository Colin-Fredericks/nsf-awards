 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal is to advance the state of the art in the                     design of planar and spatial mechanisms, with particular                        focus on kinematic and dynamic accuracy performance.  Four                      topics will be investigated.  In the first topic, kinematic                     synthesis for closed chain mechanisms, the relationship                         between the sensitivity to variations of link lengths and                       the location of the moving pivots of four link, six link                        and other complex mechanisms will be investigated for the                       objective of three and four position synthesis.  The second                     topic, kinematic synthesis for three dimensional open chain                     mechanisms, looks at design guidelines for optimizing                           mechanism endpoint accuracy performance.  In the third                          topic, dynamic synthesis for open chain multi axis                              mechanical systems, a new way of modeling three dimensional                     dynamic error as a function of frequency domain transfer                        function gain and delay time variations between axes is                         developed.  The fourth and last research topic develops                         computer simulation tools for identifying spatial accuracy                      of open chain mechanisms.  The overall research results are                     expected to be useful for practicing engineers in                               optimizing designs of planar and spatial mechanisms early                       in the design process.  Traditionally, design for                               performance has been subordinated to the design for                             strength and design for manufacturing functions.  This                          research attempts to compensate for that reduced emphasis.",
