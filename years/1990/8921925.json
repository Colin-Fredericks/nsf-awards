 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the last six years, the J.L. Kellog Graduate School of                      Management at Northwestern University has hosted a series of                    summer workshops on selected topics in economics and management.                Each of the four most recent workshops has been fairly narrowly                 focused on an area of current research, bringing together                       researchers working directly in the fields of emphasis.  Each                   has been organized around a program of formal seminars with a                   schedule that was sufficiently flexible to leave ample time for                 informal discussion and interaction.  Each workshops has been one               week long so that participants would be in attendance for the                   entire conference.  The 1990-1992 workshops will follow the same                format used in the last four years.  The general theme of the                   workshop will vary across the three years.  In 1990, the workshop               will be centered around topics in dynamic economics.  The sub-                  topics include dynamic models of international trade, dynamic                   models of public finance, models of economic growth and its                     determinants, and computation of equilibrium in dynamic models.                 The topics for the second and third years of the workshop will be               decided at a later date.  Possible topics include: Internal                     Organization of the Firm, Labor Markets and Compensation,                       Strategic Interaction in Imperfectly Competitive Markets, Game                  Theory, and Monetary Economics.                                                                                                                                 This conference series should be supported because of the                       productivity of its past conferences, the importance for the                    advance of economic theory of generating more research on dynamic               economic models and the other topics for future conferences, the                emphasis on assisting promising young theorists early in their                  careers and the contributions of the outstanding Northwestern                   faculty to the conference.",
