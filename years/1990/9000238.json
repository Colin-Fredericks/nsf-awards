The conference is to be held on May                3-6, 1990 at the Stanford Alumni Center, Fallen Leaf Lake,                      California. The tentative schedule calls for thirty speakers,                   reflecting as full a mix of gender, race and degree of                          professional advancement as is compatible with the primary                      criterion of scientific excellence. Topics to be addressed in                   formal sessions include: 1) Cell adhesion in Development, 2)                    Molecular Basis of cell differentiation, 3) Induction, 4) Growth                factors in development, 5) Pattern, 6) A Workshop on Techniques                 of Visualization. In addition, all attendees will be invited to                 contribute to a formal poster session.                                          %%%                                                                             These regional meetings have traditionally played a very                        important training function for younger scientists (graduate                    students and post doctoral students).",
