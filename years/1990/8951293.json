 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this undergraduate laboratory improvement project                  are:                                                                            (1)  to present a unified approach to the principles and practices               of date acquisition and control, and                                           (2)  to establish an \"interactive experimentation\" environment.                                                                                                 A new approach is taken for effective presentation of data                      acquisition and control principles and practices in the                         laboratory.  The equipment requested is workstation-based,                      allowing significant enhancement of the laboratory experiment                   sessions.  This multi-user environment provides direct student                  participation in the data acquisition and control process.                      Integration of the data acquisition systems into the campus                     computer network provides additional access by the student for                  pre- and post-laboratory activity.  The objectives of the project               are also to create the \"interactive experimentation\" environment;               one that allows the students to acquire the data, to control the                experiment, to reduce, analyze, and present the data, and finally, to           upload the results for later integration into an engineering                    report.  This approach represents a significant improvement over a              data taking session which often leaves the student frustrated and               without full comprehension of the material.",
