 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron-containing proteins figure prominently in the nitrogen-                    fixing symbioses between bacteria and their respective plant                    hosts.  Although iron is abundant in the soil, the acquisition of               iron is problematic due to its low solubility at biological pH                  under aerobic conditions.  The study of iron acquisition as it                  pertains to economically important symbioses is directed at                     answering three questions: 1) how do rhizobial cells acquire iron               as free-living microorganisms where they must compete for this                  nutrient with other soil inhabitants 2) how do rhizobia acquire                 iron as symbionts and 3) does iron regulate gene expression?                    Studies are continuing on the utilization of the siderophores                   citrate, ferrichrome and rhodoturulate as iron sources by B.                    japonicum as well as on the iron regulation of genes involved in                iron uptake.  This research: 1) further characterizes                           biochemically the acquisition of iron by both free-living and                   symbiotic cells of B. japonicum, 2) identifies and characterizes                genes involved in iron acquisition, including those which encode                iron-inducible outer membrane proteins, and 3) investigates the                 control of gene expression by iron.                                                                                                                             The increasing world demand for protein and the increasing                      expense of producing nitrogen fertilizer has resulted in a                      widespread interest in biological nitrogen fixation.  Although                  the nitrogen-fixing Bradyrhizobium/legume symbioses supply much                 of the fixed nitrogen for agriculture in the temperate regions of               the world, many aspects of the symbioses are still poorly                       understood.  The importance of iron in animal/pathogen                          interactions is now well established; the role of this metal in                 the nitrogen-fixing rhizobial/legume symbioses is just beginning                to be explored.  The research proposed here provides for a better               understanding of the role of iron in regulating the symbiotic                   interaction.  Such an understanding elucidates how rhizobia                     survive in the soil as well as how they interact with their plant               host to establish an effective symbiosis.  This is essential to                 any efforts to engineer a better symbiosis and for the ultimate                 extension of the symbiosis to other plant hosts.",
