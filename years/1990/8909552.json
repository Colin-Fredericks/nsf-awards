 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action provides funds to the Air Force Office of Scientific                Research for NSF's share of this jointly funded research project,               the principal investigator of which is Dr. Gail McKoon of the                   Psychology Department of Northwestern University.                                                                                                               The research is concerned with reading; it focusses on the ways                 information in memory can contribute to the inference processes                 that occur during reading.  One source of information for                       inference processes is short-term memory for parts of a text that               have just been read.  When this information is available, it                    allows, for example, inferences that decide the correct referent                of a pronoun, or inferences that relate causally two events                     described by the text.  The research will test the hypothesis                   that short-term memory information can vary in its degree of                    salience and that this will affect inference processes, so that                 more salient information is more easily used to form inferences.                A second hypothesis is that inference processes are controlled by               local coherence.  Propositions that are in short-term memory                    together because they are in the same small area of a text are                  said to be locally available.  The idea of local coherence is                   that these propositions will be connected to each other only if                 the connections are required to make the local structure                        coherent.                                                                                                                                                       A second line of research will examine the dependence of                        inference processes on knowledge in long-term memory.                           Exploratory experiments will examine whether inferences can be                  driven by the lexical structures of verbs.  Other experiments                   will examine the use of generic knowledge such as the meanings of               words and the sequences of actions that form typical events.                    Another set of experiments will examine how the meanings of words               are combined and how they are determined by context.                                                                                                            This research forms a part of a large body of ongoing research on               how people comprehend text that they read.  It is relevant to                   such societal concerns as assisting the growing number of                       children and adults who can read text mechanically but cannot                   comprehend what they read to become truly literate.",
