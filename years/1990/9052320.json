 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is upgrading the laboratory component for introductory             physics classes.  Since the faculty of Rosary College revised the               curriculum of 1987, a surprising number of non-science majors are               selecting the courses of Meteorology, the Physics of Music, Energy-             Urban Supply and Demand, and even General Physics to satisfy the one            semester science course requirement.  To meet the challenge presented           by these students often suffering from mathematics anxiety and with             little previous science background, the faculty of the Natural                  Science Department is designing new experiments, including                      interfacing some equipment with computers.  The students will come              to the classes with some previous computer experience and by                    improving data gathering, the laboratory results should be more                 consistent thereby making science methods more comprehensible.  With            the addition of a satellite dish and a digitized observational                  weather station, the meteorology and energy classes are using state-            of-the-art methods, and, through study of this information , students           obtain a better understanding of their everyday world.  For the                 students in Physics of Musics and General Physics, the addition of              a musical synthesizer and wave analyzer capable of interfacing with             a computer improves data gathering in standard experiments and adds             new possibilities of synthesizing and analyzing live music.  This               computerized instrumentation impact on the lectures with the                    capability of better and more pertinent audiovisuals.  The college              is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
