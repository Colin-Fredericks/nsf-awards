 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geometric algorithms, when implemented using rounded arithmetic, are            generally unreliable.  Unfortunately, exact arithmetic is impractical,          and much development time is spent modifying geometric programs to              deal with round-off error, never reaching absolute reliability.                 Investigation will be carried out in the area of robust geometry: the           specification and creation of geometric algorithms with provably                correct rounded arithmetic implementations.  Under the strict                   robustness approach followed in this project, algorithms are also               feasible and accurate, meaning that they generate valid geometric               objects close to the exact answer.  Employing techniques called xy-             monotonic reasoning and high level rounding, the investigator has               recently presented algorithms for accurately and efficiently                    performing any combination of set operations and Euclidean                      transformations on polygonal regions in the plane.  Strictly robust             algorithms will now be developed for constructing the following                 objects: convex hulls and Voronoi diagrams of points in multiple                dimensions, Voronoi diagrams of polyhedra, and intersections of                 polyhedral regions.  These objects have important applications, among           them the modeling of solids and the automatic generation of meshes for          finite element analysis.  In addition, the experience gained from the           creation of these algorithms is expected to provide a basis for the             creation of other robust algorithms.",
