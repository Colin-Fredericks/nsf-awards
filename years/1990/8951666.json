 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the department of Biochemistry at                  the University of Tennessee at Knoxville to give undergraduate                  majors in Biochemistry, Chemistry and Biology hands-on experience               in state-of-the-art biochemical techniques.  Emphasis will be                   placed on methods used in the analysis of the structure and                     function of proteins in experiments that also illustrate some                   current principles in regulatory biology.  Specific methods will                deal with protein and peptide purification; physical, chemical                  and immunochemical analyses of proteins; and molecular cloning                  and recombinant DNA techniques.  Major instruments to be                        purchased in support of the project will include:  1. A high                    performance liquid chromatography and data analysis system for                  protein chemistry experiments; 2. Recording spectrophotometers                  for protein spectral and enzyme kinetics  experiments; 3. A plate               reader for enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays;                                4. Electrophoresis equipment for structural land immunochemical                 analyses of purified proteins and for recombinant DNA                           experiments; 5. Preparative centrifuge rotors for DNA and protein               experiments; 6. Additional general equipment for the analyses                   described above.  The acquisition of the instruments will allow                 the students to participate in experiments that are not commonly                done in undergraduate biochemistry laboratories, and will provide               a sound foundation for future work in research and education.                   The grantee is matching the award from non-Federal sources.",
