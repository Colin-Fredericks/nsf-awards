 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of a process for controlling errors of                         idealization will be investigated under this project: The exact                 solution of a mathematical model is in fact an approximate                      solution of a more general mathematical model.  For example, the                problem of linear elasticity can be viewed as the first step in                 Newton's method in solving nonlinear problems.  The key to                      assessment and control of errors associated with mathematical                   models is to view those models as members in a hierarchic                       sequence of models.  The sequence of (exact) solutions                          corresponding to those models converges to the most general                     mathematical representation of the system modelled.  The model is               properly chosen if the engineering conclusions derived from it                  are not sensitive with respect to the various assumptions                       incorporated in the idealization, such as assumptions of linear                 elasticity, kinematic boundary conditions, etc.                                      Focus will be on the treatment of an important class of                    engineering problems, the modelling of structural connections.                  Incorporation of experimental information into mathematical                     models of structural connections will be investigated.",
