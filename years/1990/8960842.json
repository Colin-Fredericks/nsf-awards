 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to design and build a generic adaptive                      filtering module for digital communication systems.  The design                 is based on the multi-channel fast Recursive Least Squares (RLS)                adaptive filtering algorithm.  The design includes echo                         cancellation, equalization, automatic gain control, and timing                  and carrier recovery performed digitally on single or multiple                  digital signal processors.  Fixed and floating point                            implementations are developed and the finite precision issues                   involved in mapping these algorithms to finite wordlength digital               signal processors (DSPs) are addressed.  Real time and high level               simulations of these algorithms will be performed over realistic                channels.  These include fading in mobile digital radio and                     voice-band channels with various impairments.  Present digital                  communication systems based on current adaptive filtering                       technology fail in worst case channels for voice-band modems and                in the case of mobile communication systems, during rapid                       fading.                                                                           Higher speed communication over channels with more noise and                  distortion will become feasible by employing these new                          algorithms.  Further, the all digital DSP-based design ensures                  manufacturability with greater reliability and little or no time                consuming manual adjustments.***",
