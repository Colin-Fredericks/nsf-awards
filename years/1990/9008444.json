This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a 15-month visit by Dr. David A.                        Wiggins to Sweden to work with Dr. Lars Gustafsson of Uppsala                   University on \"Constraints on the Evolution of Breeding Date                    in Birds.\"  Most birds exhibit considerable variation in the                    timing of clutch initiations within populations.  Because                       breeding date correlates with several components of fitness                     (clutch size; the number of young produced; the number of                       young recruited to the breeding population in subsequent                        years), breeding date is thought to be under considerable                       directional selection.  However, despite significant                            heritability estimates for breeding date in natural populations                 of birds, several studies have failed to detect significant                     changes in breeding date.  Recent work has suggested that                       breeding date fails to respond to selection due to a large                      environmental component affecting female nutrition.  The                        researchers propose to carry out experiments on the timing of                   breeding in collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) on the                   island of Gotland, a population unique in that a high                           proportion (25%) of fledged young return to the island the                      following summer, thus enabling quantitative genetic estimates                  from comparisons of adult and offspring reproductive traits.                    The researchers propose to both delay and advance the date of                   laying by manipulating eggs in a randomly chosen sample of                      flycatcher clutches, altering the clutch initiation date by                     approximately one week.  In this population, differences of                     breeding date of one week have significant effects on most                      reproductive traits.  The researchers will band all offspring                   from experimental and control nests and then compare the                        clutch initiation dates of these offspring in the following                     year with those of their mothers.  This will allow the                          researchers to test the current models of the evolution of                      breeding date by estimating: 1) the magnitude of the environ-                   mental component of breeding date variance; 2) the heritability                 of breeding date; and 3) the evolutionary consequences of                       variance in breeding date.",
