 "awd_abstract_narration": "We have been studying the structural features of insulin                        analogs in solution as part of project to engineer proteins                     with altered biologic and physical properties.  A striking                      finding has been the degree of flexibility observed for insulin                 in solution.  Most notably, the binding potency of several                      analogs correlates with overall molecular flexibility.                          Selected mutations and bridging structures can lock                             conformational substructures that are not productive for                        receptor recognition.  Moreover, mutations that increase                        molecular flexibility appear to reverse these effects.                          Therefore, we have identified a system for relating protein                     structures in crystals, in solution (NMR) and at the receptor                   surface.  It appears that changes in molecular structure are                    necessary accompaniments to high affinity receptor recognition.                 In the current proposal I have outlined three complimentary                     approaches for defining the structural requirements of insulin                  action.  First, site-site interactions between insulin and the                  insulin receptor will be positively identified.  In this                        fashion, comparative binding surfaces of insulin and the                        insulin receptor will be constructed, using the three-                          dimensional crystal structure of insulin as a template.                         Second, solution structures of selected series of analogs are                   being analyzed by NMR and CD spectroscopy.  Specific structural                 features will be correlated  with receptor binding potency.                     Finally, increasing concentrations of truncated receptor                        homologs will be added to solutions of insulin and selected                     analogs; the effects on insulin structure will be                               characterized.  In combination these studies should identify                    the structural features in solution that are necessary for                      receptor binding and the changes in structure that accompany                    binding.  Furthermore, these studies will help to provide a                     more general foundation for studying relationships between                      protein crystal structures, solution structures, and changes                    in structure that occur during complex formation.",
