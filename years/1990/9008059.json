The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or                             compleme\u001antary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions                in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                           This award will support an eight-month visit by Dr. John                        Borrazzo to Berlin, Germany, to work with Dr. Bernd Seifert                     at the Institute for Water, Soil, and Air Hygiene on \"Effects                   of Sorption to Surfaces on Indoor Concentrations of Organic                     Vapors.\"  Research during the past decade indicates that                        indoor concentrations of organic vapors are unrelated to and                    often higher than outdoor concentrations for many compounds.                    This has important implications for public health since some                    of these compounds exhibit carcinogenic or mutagenic behavior                   in humans and/or animals.  Some of the organic compounds may                    also exhibit acute health effects.  For these reasons,                          understanding the fundamental processes which govern indoor                     concentrations is necessary.  Both the PI and his host have                     independently explored the sorption of organic compounds to                     indoor surfaces.  Few other data are available as this issue                    has only recently emerged as an important research question                     in the indoor air quality research community.  The PI                           proposes to review the unpublished data of the host, to apply                   models for sorption kinetics and equilibrium developed as                       part of his recent doctoral studies, and to conduct experiments                 designed to resolve discrepancies between theory and the                        available data.  The investigators expect one product of the                    research to be a refined sorption model.  The collaboration                     should also result in broader incorporation of sorption                         effects in the general indoor air quality and exposure                          assessment models currently being developed.",
