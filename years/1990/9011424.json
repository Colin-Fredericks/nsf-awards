 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project attempts to advance theoretical understanding of                   problem solving in a multiple agent environment, as applied to a                resource allocation problem.  The research is cast in a decision                theoretic framework.  It explores the process of decision making                where: a) information is obtained about the preference profiles                 of each agent; b) the information acquired is then used as a                    basis for finding socially optimal resource allocation that                     maximize total net welfare, and; c) the costs involved in                       acquiring information are considered an integral part of the                    process.  The objective of the research is to deal with the                     following specific issues: 1) the study of various  communication               patterns and strategies for information gathering and various                   system topologies for team decision making; 2) the investigation                of the incorporation of computational costs, and the tradeoff                   between the relative cost and time of computation versus                        communication for effective management of resources; 3) the study               of the problems concerning incentive compatibility; 4) the                      investigation of alternative goals to finding a socially optimal                resource allocation; 5) the examination of the static resource                  allocation problem, versus the dynamic one, with incremental                    addition and deletion of resources.  Results of this                            investigation should have significance, not only for the                        practical use of decision theoretic models, but also in providing               insights into research fundamental to the design and use of                     computer and communication systems to coordinate work and                       decision making.",
