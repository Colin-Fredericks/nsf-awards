This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in  the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and                     Computer Science.  The names of the investigators and the titles                of their projects follow:  Michael Slattery and Eamonn O'Brien,                 Computational Group Theory; Stephen Merrill, Peter Tonellato,                   Naveen Bansal, Anne Clough and Gary Krenz, Mathematical Modeling                and Scientific Visualization; George Corliss and Gary Krenz,                    Reliable Scientific Computation.",
