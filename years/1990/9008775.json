 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops models of the interaction of inflation with               the price system which are microtheoretic but can be aggregated to              shed light on inflation.  Two complementary directions of research              are pursued, corresponding to the deterministic and stochastic                  components of inflation.  First, the project studies inflationary               trends in a monopolistically competitive search market with costly              price setting.  The model captures the idea that inflation results,             through increased price dispersion, in more resources spent on                  search.  Second, the project examines the effects of the variance               in inflation rates, in a duopoly model where buyers and sellers                 face a Lucas-type signal extraction problem.  The central issues                here are how inflation variability affects the informational                    content of prices, buyers' incentives to become informed, and                   firms' monopoly power.                                                                                                                                          According to conventional macroeconomic wisdom, one of the main                 channels through which inflation disrupts the efficiency of markets             is through the increased variability and dispersion of relative                 prices.  This in turn is said to cause many inefficiencies, such                as incorrect production decisions, more resources spent on search               and a deterioration in the informational content of prices.  There              is substantial empirical support of this view of inflation.  The                contribution of this project comes from developing a rigorous                   microeconomic foundation for addressing the macroeconomic issue of              inflation and for interpreting empirical facts.  By dealing with                inflation both in trend and in variance, and analyzing its effects              in two very different models, this project should encompass a wide              range of efficiency effects, and cast theoretical light on several              important propositions about inflation.",
