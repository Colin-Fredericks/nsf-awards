During the last 10 years, they have                        reached more than 20,000 students with their unique collection                  of hands-on science activities.  The project is well on the way                 to becoming self sufficient, and this final award will document                 both the philosophy of instruction and specific teaching                        methods that they have used and provide a third party                           evaluation of the processes of learning that they encourage in                  informal science education programs.                                                                                                                                 Hands-On Science Outreach, Inc. will publish two 32 page                   booklets outlining their history, philosophy, and methods, and                  will conduct a third party evaluation of classes in four                        demographically diverse sites around the country, carried out                   under the direction of Dr. Harris Shettel, a nationally                         recognized informal education researcher.  The resulting                        reports and publications will be widely disseminated, providing                 valuable information to others planning to offer hands-on                       science activities for children.",
