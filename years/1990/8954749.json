 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, we will extend to the earth sciences the educational           advances of our prior Modeling and Microcomputer Based Lab projects that        have generated primarily in mathematics and the physical sciences.  This        project will bring important, current scientific issues into the                secondary school classroom.  Initially, we will focus on scientific             issues of global change.  We will take advantage of current scientific          research and technology, and transfer these developments where                  appropriate to tools and activities suitable for kids.  We aim to               capture the excitement of current national and international efforts            addressing global change through extensive contact and collaboration            with practicing researchers.  We plan to make issues of global change           accessible to an understandable by students by providing opportunities          for them to participate in modeling, data analysis, and experimental            measurements.  To this end, we plan to develop numerical simulations,           sophisticated data analysis tools, and new sensors and systems for data         acquisition.  The project will develop and evaluate classroom material          for incorporating these advances, undertake studies that increase our           understanding of how students can best use these developments, and will         provide realistic mechanisms for wide dissemination of our work.  The           project involves close collaboration among a broad range of individuals,        institutions, and businesses.  The work will be guided by an outstanding        panel of expert researcher and educators.",
