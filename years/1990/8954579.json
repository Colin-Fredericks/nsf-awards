 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a cooperative project for the development of teacher                    leadership in science and mathematics at the early childhood                    level.  This two-year project will involve 67 participants in                   a three-week summer institute, four follow-up meetings during                   the school year, and a leadership retreat.  Based on the                        successful Tri-County Mathematics Project (TCMP) model and                      supported by its trained leaders, this project includes                         participation by the Office of the Santa Barbara County                         Superintendent of Schools, Santa Barbara City College, the                      University of California Santa Barbara, and local school                        districts.  The goals are to enhance preschool and primary                      teachers' knowledge of science and mathematics, develop a new                   cadre of early childhood education teacher fellows to bridge                    the gap between preschool and K-3, bring together teachers                      from different school districts for cooperative learning,                       link with TCMP for preschool-12 continuity, implement                           recommendations of California's School Readiness Task Force                     Report, and develop positive early science and mathematics                      experiences for young children and their families.",
