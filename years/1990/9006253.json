 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this US/USSR collaborative research project is                 to clarify the structure and function of the short baseplate                    fiber, P12, of T4 bacteriophage.  P12 is the organelle by which                 phage T4 irreversibly attaches to its host, E. coli.  P12 will be               studied both in isolation and as an organelle on the phage                      particle.  An assay will be developed and gp12 monomer as well as               the P12 trimer unit will be purified, and a combination of                      physiological, bioenergetic, structural and genetic studies will                be undertaken.   This proposal for a US/USSR collaborative                      research project will combine the technical strengths of three                  investigators: E. Goldberg, of Tufts University, the US                         scientist, is an expert in the physiology and genetics of                       bacterophage host recognition, attachment, and injection. Two                   investigators from the USSR will participate.  V. Mesyanzhinov,                 of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology, Moscow, whose expertise                 is biochemistry has subcloned and sequenced gp12 and the genes                  surrounding it, and has developed a method for purification of                  the gp12 monomer and the P12 trimer.  L. Grinius, of Vilnius                    University, an expert in bioenergetics, has recently worked on                  the depolarizaton of the host bacterium during phage attachment.                His laboratory has developed a specific electrode form membrane                 potential measurements which can accurately measure changes in                  real time.  This collaboration will provide the combination of                  approaches necessary to characterize the composition, assembly,                 physiological role and mechanism of action of P12.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This US/USSR collaborative project should lead to a better                      understanding of the structure and mechanism(s) of action of a                  fibrous protein responsible for the attachment of the bacterial                 virus, \"T4\", to its host bacterium, E. coli.  During attachment                 of this protein to the bacterium the protein changes its                        configuration and promotes changes in the permeability of the                   bacterial membrane.  The isolated protein also has the ability to               kill the bacteria.  The results of this project will contribute                 to basic knowledge of some of the most fundamental problems of                  biology:  recognition at the molecular level, the mechanism of                  formation and structure of channels controlling the permeability                of membranes, and the mechanism of bacterial killing by a virus.",
