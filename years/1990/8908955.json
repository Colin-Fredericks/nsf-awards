 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past five years, steady state fluorescence microscopy has                revolutionized light microscopy due to the high degree of                       sensitivity and specificity.  The time resolution of steady state               fluorescence microscopy when used to measure chemical or                        molecular parameters has been in the seconds to hundreds of                     milliseconds range.  Fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetimes                 can attain time resolutions from nanoseconds to seconds depending               on the probe and can be used to extend the temporal resolution of               measurements.  In addition, the chemical and physical environment               of a fluorescent or phosphorescent probe influences the lifetime                of the excited state of the probe.  Thus the decay of the                       luminescence produced by an excitation pulse is characteristic of               the chemical and physical environment so time resolved microscopy               can be used to measure chemical and molecular changes in cells.                 Results with a test microscope system have demonstrated the                     feasibility of the approach and we are asking for the                           commercially available components to assemble a complete system.                The applications include characterizing the lifetimes of newly                  developed dyes, measuring changes in ionic environments in cells                to measuring the rotational diffusion coefficients of labeled                   macromolecules.  This latter measurement will allow the                         characterization of assembly and binding processes of                           macromolecules in living cells.  Time resolved microscopy will                  become a complementary tool to steady state microscopy and will                 be the method of choice in many applications where the total                    excitation dose must be minimized.  In fact the lower total                     excitation dose required and the higher sensitivity of rotational               diffusion measurements will probably make this the methods of                   choice over the now popular fluorescence photobleaching                         redistribution technique in many applications.",
