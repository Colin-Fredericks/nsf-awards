 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretically based engineering correlations are developed for                  prediction of structure, scaling properties, and growth                         velocities far from equilibrium in electrochemical deposition.                  Structures and structural transitions are correlated with                       control parameters and are recorded with high-resolution                        photomacroscopy.  The principles governing destabilization of                   an initially smooth growth front and its dynamic                                restabilization into a structured aggregate are formulated by                   analysis of the diffusion and electric fields with                              consideration of concentration, kinetic overpotential, and                      double-layer charging.  Schlieren photography is used to image                  the diffusion field around growing aggregates.  The role of                     the surface overpotential is probed using AC impedance                          measurements.                                                                                                                                                   The theory developed in this project and the control                            strategies derivative from it will have broad applicability                     whenever electrically induced aggregation is either necessary                   or detrimental.  Test metals for the experimental verification                  are selected to be technologically relevant, so that the                        results should be immediately applicable in battery and                         microelectronic circuit production.",
