 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                   geometry of Professor William McCallum of the University of                     Arizona. Dr. McCallum's project is to study the Shafarevich-Tate                group of elliptic curves and Abelian varieties defined over                     number fields in order to verify a number of conjectures of                     Kolyvagin. The elliptic curves under consideration will be                      modular, while the Abelian varieties to be studied will all be                  Jacobian varieties of Fermat curves.                                                 Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines the               techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its                      original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that                   could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                 polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and                   such questions as divisibility of one whole number by another.                  These two subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact                        influenced each other from the earliest times, but in the past                  quarter century the mutual influence has increased greatly. The                 field of arithmetic algebraic geometry now uses techniques from                 all of modern mathematics, and is having corresponding influence                beyond its own borders.",
