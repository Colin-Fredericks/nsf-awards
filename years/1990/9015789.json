 "awd_abstract_narration": "This industry internship project will be carried out in                    conjunction with MILCO, one of the largest textile industries in                the country.  The main products of MILCO are TRICO fabric for                   internal use as well as for sale to other companies, and ladies'                sleep wear for wholesale supply to large stores.  Currently, MILCO              has significant problems in maintaining high productivity due to                space limitations and the lack of an efficient computerized                     production planning and inventory control system.  The objectives               of this project are: (1)  provide MILCO with analytical tools to                study the various alternatives to solve their plant layout problem,             (2)  improving their marking and cutting operations, (3)  help them             to develop a long-term strategy for production planning and                     inventory control and, finally, (4)  establish a future                         collaboration with MILCO to work with research problems of their                interest.  It is also expected that the knowledge gained in this                project will have a significant impact on the Principal                         Investigator's long-term development as researchers and teachers.",
