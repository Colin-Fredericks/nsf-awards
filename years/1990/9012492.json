 "awd_abstract_narration": "Major developments in science and technology often have important               social, legal and ethical implications.  This is clearly true of                new developments in computer science and technology.  Computer                  professionals, philosophers, social scientists and public policy                makers have responded to these issues in a variety of promising                 ways.  Some professional organizations and governments, both state              and federal, have begun to address some of the problems.  This                  project will build on these efforts by sponsoring a national                    conference on computer ethics in the summer 1991.  This inter-                  professional, four day event will bring together persons from these             different disciplines and organizations, who generally have little              opportunity to interact.  They will hear cross-disciplinary                     perspectives in keynote addresses and participate in heterogeneous              working groups to discuss and explore six major themes: (1)                     privacy, (2) system security, (3) equity and access, (4) software               ownership, (5) values in the computer curriculum, and (6) values                in academic computing.                                                                                                                                          The conference is the initial event in the agenda of the Research               Center on Computing and Society at Southern Connecticut State                   University.  Much of the administrative framework for the center                is in place.  The center will help to provide long-term,                        institutional assistance for a cross-disciplinary network of                    people, organizations and materials on this topic.  The center will             support faculty development, research activity, publication and                 distribution of materials, major international events, curriculum               development, case studies, training sessions and tutorials.  The                books, journals, reports, articles, data bases, software, films,                videos and other materials contributed to, or prepared for, the                 conference will yield the core of a research library that the                   center will maintain and expand to provide a resource for studies               in computing and values.  The conference itself will generate model             curriculum materials, proceedings, reports, and a \"Resource                     Directory on Computing and Values,\" all of which will be widely                 available in paper and electronic form.                                                                                                                         This proposal grows from a successful EVS planning grant that                   brought together individuals representing the range of professions              and professional associations and journals involved in issues of                computer ethics.  It also generated press and policy interest.  The             conference is timely and appropriate; it is likely to be well                   attended; outcomes will be widely disseminated; evaluation and                  follow-up activities are planned.  Institutional support is very                good and the principal investigators and associates highly                      qualified.  The proposal is recommended for support with high                   priority.",
