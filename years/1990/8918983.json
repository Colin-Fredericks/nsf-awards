 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of modeling studies of a variety of biologically                       significant phenomena involving the interactions of biopolymers                 with smaller molecules and with other biopolymers is proposed.                  Systems in which molecules bind to a long biopolymer                            represented by a one-dimensional lattice will be studied.                       Specifically:  a.) The effects of multiple maxima (biomodality)                 in the probability distribution of the number of ligands bound                  to the lattice will be examined; b.) earlier methods, which                     take the lattice to be homogenous, with information about the                   sequence of monomers along the lattice will be augmented; c.)                   new approximation techniques more appropriate to heterogenous                   lattices will be sought; and d.) a new, simple model for ion                    transport through multi-ion membrane channels will be explored.                 In considering the aggregation of biopolymer chains with one                    another, e.) both the kinetic and the structural aspects of the                 process by which biopolymers aggregate to form clusters will                    be investigated; f.) methods for studying the kinetics of                       linear aggregation phenomena with emphasis on the                               polymerization of tubulin to form microtubules will be                          developed; and g.) approaches to designing molecules that                       disrupt the aggregation process will be sought.                                                                                                                 The interaction of biological macromolecules with smaller                       molecules and with other biopolymers is an ever present                         occurrence in the normal (and abnormal) processes of biological                 systems.  An understanding of these interactions is essential                   for an understanding of the functioning of biological systems.                   //",
