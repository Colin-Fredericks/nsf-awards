The first workshop will be                 held in conjunction with the twentieth anniversary celebration of               the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM) at the Joint                     Meeting of the American Mathematical Society (AMS) and the                      Mathematical Association of America (MAA) in January 1991.  Part                of the program will consist of an AWM Symposium entitled \"The                   Future of Women in Mathematics;\" this symposium will involve                    approximately ten recent doctoral recipients who will present                   thirty minute talks on their research.  The other planned                       activities will run concurrently with the Joint Meeting.  The                   other two workshops will be held prior to major mathematical                    meetings in 1992; the first at the Joint Mathematics Meeting                    (January 1992) and the second at the national meeting of the                    Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (July 1992).                     These workshops will bring together women who are recent doctoral               recipients or graduate students in mathematics, and several                     established mathematicians.  The workshop participants will be                  expected to give a brief presentation on their research interests               and research environment.  It is expected that the opportunity to               meet and interact with one another, as well as with a few                       established mathematicians, will enable the participants to                     promote their own research and decrease their professional                      isolation.",
