 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magneto-transport measurement has been proven as one of the most                powerful methods in charactering advanced semiconductor materials and           devices.  The measurement can provide vast information about a                  material and a device, such as carrier mobility, carrier density,               effective mass of electrons and holes, elastic and inelastic                    scattering lengths, phonon emissions, gate capacitance, layer                   thicknesses, etc.  To establish this important characterization                 capability in Department of Electrical Engineering at University of             Minnesota, we propose to purchase a superconducting magnet system               (SMS), which consists of a superconducting magnet of the maximum                fields of 9 Tesla and a cryostat of the lowest cooling temperature of           1.5K.  Such SMS is not only necessary, but also very crucial to our             current vigorous ongoing research program on artificially structured            new semiconductor materials and devices for future electronics.                 Currently, our department has total 10 faculty members in the area of           semiconductor materials and devices; and at least five of them have             great need of using magneto-transport characterization for their                research.  With a magnet system requested in the proposal, we will              measure the effective mass of electrons and holes in artificially               structured crystals grown by MBE; we will study the transport in                various new quantum-effect-based semiconductor devices fabricated by            MBE and ultra-high resolution e-beam lithography; we will investigate           the effect of strain in the artificially structured materials on the            transport properties of electrons and holes, and on the performance of          semiconductor devices; and we will characterize the delta doped MBE             grown films.  Undoubtedly, not only the listed research but also many           other related research in Department of Electrical Engineering at               University of Minnesota can benefit greatly from getting this magnet            system.",
