 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to help fill in the gaps in our                       knowledge by conducting a survey of Mexican American                            political organizations, their goals, tactics, and                              methods by which they attract and retain their members.  A                      major empirical question to be explored is how a reward                         schedule offered by leaders is structured and adjusted in                       order to assure continued member participation.  The PI will                    identify four basic types of groups in the Mexican American                     Political Culture.  He hypothesizes that 1) Lower income                        organizations will depend almost exclusively on expressive                      rewards while downplaying the social and recreational                           aspects of their incentive package and 2) Upper class                           organizations will focus more on material rewards for group                     membership while offering a wider range of solidarity                           benefits.  He also hypothesizes that the relationship                           between staff and the rank and file varies according to the                     socioeconomic status of the membership.  Groups chosen for                      the survey will be politically active groups in the two                         largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area for                              California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois                      and active groups in Washington D.C.  These groups will be                      selected from three major national Hispanic Directories.  To                    augument the list,interviews with local politicians,                            activists, scholars and journalists will be conducted.",
