 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this research is to understand the                   molecular and cellular processes by which ethylene controls fruit               ripening and gene expression. The model system is Lycopersicon                  esculentum (tomato). By analyzing the effect of promoter                        deletions on gene expression in fruit from transformed plants,                  and in a recently developed microprojectile transient assay                     system, 5'-flanking regions that control gene expression in a                   positive and negative manner have been identified. Sites that                   react with developmentally regulated DNA-binding activities have                been delineated, and a clone encoding a DNA-binding protein has                 been isolated. The specific goal is to elucidate the mechanisms                 of ethylene action at the gene level. Ethylene-inducible promoter               fine structure will be analyzed by determining the effect of                    promoter mutations on gene expression in a transient gene                       expression system and in transgenic fruit. Specific mutations                   will include deletion of sites that react with DNA binding                      proteins, and alterations of binding site position and                          orientation within the promoter. Factors that regulate ethylene                 inducible gene expression will be studied by cloning DNA binding                proteins that bind to critical DNA regulatory sequences. The                    cloned gene will be used to generate specific antibodies and                    these tools will be used to determine the mechanism that                        regulates DNA binding activity. DNA binding protein function will               be elucidated genetically by analyzing the phenotype of                         transgenic plants with reduced levels of DNA binding activity due               to the expression of an antisense DNA binding protein gene. The                 interaction of the DNA binding protein with ethylene and/or other               nuclear proteins will be analyzed.                                              %%%                                                                             The plant hormone, ethylene, controls fruit ripening. This                      project is an investigation, at the molecular and genetic level,                of how that control is carried out.",
