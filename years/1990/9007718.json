 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation will continue the study of cellular                     control systems and delay differential equations.  There are                    three main areas of study.  The first area is an                                interdisciplinary study done in collaboration with Dr. J. W.                    Zyskind on the modeling of initiation of replication in                         Escherichia coli, Mathematical models are developed to aid in our               understanding of experimental observations on initiation of DNA                 replication.  The second  project uses analytical and numerical                 methods to study the effects of size and compartmentalization on                the stability of cellular control models with diffusion and                     delays.  Dynamic growth models are developed and compared to                    experimental data.  The third area explores the stability of a                  linear differential equation with two delays using analytical and               numerical methods.  Bifurcation surfaces are found, and methods                 are investigated to connect their geometries to analytical                      results.  The first two projects link mathematical studies to                   current biological problems.  All three problems require the                    development of new techniques of analysis that can be applied to                many modeling problems.",
