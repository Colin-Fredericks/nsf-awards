 "awd_abstract_narration": "A workshop entitled Spliceosome Assembly and Alternative                        RNA Splicing will be held in France in September.  The                          meeting is being organized under the aegis of the                               European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and will                         be limited to 70-90 participants, at least half of whom                         will be Americans.                                                                                                                                              A great variety of cellular and viral genes rely on a                           regulated program of alternative splicing for appropriate                       tissue and stage-specific gene expression.  This meeting                        will focus on the molecular mechanisms of regulated                             alternative splicing and, as such, is the first to be                           devoted to this important level of gene regulation.                             Rapid preliminary progress is now being made in                                 understanding the biochemistry of alternative splicing                          in a number of specific systems.  Three sessions of the                         meeting will focus on new developments in splice site                           selection and four sessions will deal with the mechanisms                       of alternative splicing in viruses and cellular genes.                          The meeting will end with a workshop on practical aspects                       of establishing tissue-specific splicing extracts, so                           that the systems can be studied and manipulated in vitro.",
