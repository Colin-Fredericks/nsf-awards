 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will make observations of cloud droplets and snow                  crystal replicas at the GISP-II coring site in Greenland in order               to assess the importance of ice particle riming on chemical wet                 deposition and aerosol scavenging at the Summit site during the                 summer of 1990.  Aerosol scavenging is a complex process which                  takes different forms within clouds and below coulds, and also                  depends strongly on the cloud droplet distribution spectrum,                    focusses on the collision efficiencies between ice particles and                cloud droplets (the riming process), and the subsquent scavenging               efficiencies and precipitation rates.                                                                                                                           Atmospheric aerosol particles scavenged by ice crystal growth form              a part of the chemical record preserved in the Greenland ice sheet,             and form a time series in the observations in an ice core.  This                record has historically been interpreted as a representation of the             composition of the atmosphere at the time of deposition, and a                  variation of the particle content along the core has been                       interpeted as a corresponding variation in the composition of the               atmosphere.  The assumption that a one-to-one relationship exists,              or even that it is linear, is not well established at this time.                This project will help establish a firmer basis for these                       relationships.",
