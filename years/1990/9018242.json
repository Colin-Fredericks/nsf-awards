 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry Division is supporting efforts                   in the area of curriculum development by sponsoring a two-day                   workshop for the 51 current chemistry Research Experience for                   Undergraduate (REU) Site directors and interested persons from                  the Foundation.   The aims of the workshop, to be held at the                   Foundation during September 19-21, 1990, are: 1) to discuss the                 role of chemistry research in the undergraduate curriculum and                  in the students' career choices, 2) to assess the impact of the                 REU Program on undergraduate education, on subsequent                           enrollment in graduate chemistry-related research programs and                  on ultimate career decisions, 3) to formulate specific                          proposals for the enhancement and increased effectiveness of                    the REU Program and the operation of individual sites, and 4)                   to develop strategies for expanding the visibility of the                       Program.                                                                                                                                                        The concrete results of the workshop will be 1) a \"White Paper\"                 summarizing the conclusions of the workshop, a document which                   will serve in part to advise those at the Foundation who are                    involved in the REU Program, 2) a set of guidelines for REU                     site directors, and 3) plans for a future symposium at a                        National Meeting of the American Chemical Society dealing with                  undergraduate research and the REU Program.  It is anticiupated                 that the overall impact of the workshop will be an improvement                  in opportunities for direct student exposure to research and an                 increase in the number of people opting for research careers.",
