 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports research and development on \"Hydra\", a digital              circuit design system based on stream recursion equations.  Hydra               supplies a solid mathematical foundation for circuit specification,             derivation, simulation, analysis and layout.  In the SBIR Phase I               research, an experimental prototype compiler that translates a                  specification into an efficient simulation program was built.  This             research addresses several problems.  First, circuit analysis                   algorithms are being used to produce parallel simulators both for MIMD          and SIMD architectures.  Second, the functional language notation of            the compiler is being improved to incorporate visualization techniques,         interactive graphics and functional geometry.  Finally, methods for             incorporating Hydra into existing sets of circuit design tools are              being investigated.                                                             Phase I objectives were met quite successfully.  The problem,                   derivation of digital designs from functional programs is important             because of its promise to demonstrate how functional programming ideas          fare in real world IC design.  The P.I. and his associates' past work           has been of high quality; they are well qualified to carry out the              proposed research.",
