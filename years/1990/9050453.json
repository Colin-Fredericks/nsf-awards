 "awd_abstract_narration": "A stopped-flow (SF) rapid mixing accessary is being used to                     introduce undergraduate chemistry, biochemistry and molecular                   biology students to an important method for studying fast                       reactions.  The SF accessory is primarily used with a UV/Visible                absorption spectrometer (UV/VIS), computerized and modified for                 rapid data collection.  Reactions with half-lives on the order of               20-50 milliseconds are studied with the system.  Many biological                enzyme-catalyzed reactions are studied with the SF/UV/VIS system.               The SF/UV/VIS instrument is used by junior majors in a combined                 analytical, inorganic and physical chemistry laboratory.  Senior                thesis research students use the SF/UV/VIS instrument to study                  the oxygenation of cobalt-substituted hemocyanin,  The hands-on                 experience with a technique used to study rapid reaction has                    enhanced the students' understanding of concepts of biochemical                 and chemical kinetics.                                                                                                                                          The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
