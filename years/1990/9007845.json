 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the ecological and evolutionary                   significance of flow regime to macroinvertebrate communities in                 tropical dry forest streams of Costa Rica.  Pristine tropical                   watersheds are ideal sites for testing the effects of flow on                   stream communities because the confounding effects of seasonality               in temperature and photoperiod and high silt and sediment load                  associated with most temperate streams are absent, and many                     pristine small streams with perennial flow regimes are available                for study.                                                                           The research will quantify macroinvertebrate community                     structure and the life history characteristics and production of                all widespread and common species of macroinvertebrates in riffle               habitat of six perennial streams.  The study will focus on                      temporal changes in these parameters in response to prolonged (6                month) periods of both constant (dry season) and elevated (wet                  season) flow as well as to short-term flood flaws during the wet                season.  The central hypothesis of the study is that: stream                    macroinvertebrate communities are not oversaturated with species                (in the absence of disturbance) and may be capable of                           withstanding long periods of abiotic stability without loss of                  diversity, i.e. there is no \"paradox of the stream benthos\".                         The principal objectives of this research project are to:                  (1) quantify seasonal variation in the relative abundance and                   species composition of macroinvertebrates and test the utility of               flow as a covariate for explaining this variability; (2) document               the extent of seasonality in macroinvertebrate life histories and               evaluate sesonality as an adaptation to flow regime; (3) evaluate               the relative  importance of storms in explaining seasonal                       variability in macroinvertebrate community structure (4) assess                 the role of spatial scale (i.e. patch size) in studies of benthic               community succession; and (5) evaluate the role of disturbance in               maintaining the diversity of stream communities.",
