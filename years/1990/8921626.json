 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NBER Summer Institute brings together economists from                       universities, government and international organizations for a                  few days or a few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences and                 collaborative research. Last year's Summer Institute included 603               economists from 158 universities and nonacademic institutions                   around the world. Of these, 215 attended for the first time. A                  similar number is expected to attend this summer. Special efforts               are made to include young economists.                                                                                                                           The Summer Institute is organized into seven programs: economic                 fluctuations, economic history, financial markets and monetary                  economics, taxation, international studies, labor studies and                   productivity. Each program has its own group of participants and                its own structure. Although there is considerable variation among               programs, a typical Summer Institute program will last for one to               three weeks, with seminars each morning and afternoon devoted to                individual research. Some programs conclude with a more formal                  conference. Programs may include a variety of subjects or they                  may be organized around a specific topic.                                                                                                                       The Summer Institute provides a unique opportunity for economists               to work closely with others in their areas of specialty for                     extended and generally intense periods of research. Although                    numerous conferences permit researchers a few hours in which to                 exchange ideas, only NBER's Summer Institute lasts long enough to               allow serious collaboration among economists from several                       institutions. While there are of course presentations of work                   nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of               the program, where new ideas are raised, preliminary research                   ideas are developed and plans for joint or coordinated research                 efforts are established.",
