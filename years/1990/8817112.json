 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to support collaborative research on the               evolution of the early Archean gneiss complex in the Saglek-                    Hebron area, northern Labrador.  The study area forms part of the               North Atlantic Craton, a major Archean block that preserves                     fragmentary evidence of pre-3800 Ma crust formation.                                 Objectives of the study are to:                                                                                                                            North Atlantic Craton by documenting examples of pre-3800                       Ma crust;                                                                                                                                                              regions from a terrane that contains extremely ancient                          crust; and                                                                                                                                                      to crustal evolutionary models.                                                                                                                               Research will carried out on:  (1) tonalitic and                           trondhjemitic Uivak and pre-Uivak gneisses; and (2) a variety of                ultramafic lithologies, some of which occur as tectonically                     emplaced rafts within pre-3600 Ma Uivak gneisses.  Petrogenetic                 information for Uivak and pre-Uivak tonalitic gneisses will be                  obtained from major and trace element geochemistry.  Age data                   will be derived through analysis of Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr, and Pb-Pb                     isotopic systems and by application of the Kober (1986) single                  zircon TIMS technique.  This will provide additional petrogenetic               data, and will enable mantle separation ages, source compositions               and metamorphic histories of the suites to be determined.                       Information on the composition, age and crustal residence history               of early Archean ultramafic units will be achieved by a                         geochemical and Sm-Nd, Pb-Pb and Rb-Sr isotopic study of whole                  rocks and separated mineral phases.  Isotope geochemistry will be               carried out at UCSC.  Major and trace element (including REE)                   geochemistry will be carried out by Weaver at the University of                 Oklahoma.                                                                            The study will provide direct constraints on the chronology                and chemical evolution of early Archean crust in the North                      Atlantic Craton.  These constraints will be important for models                of the early fractionation of the Earth.",
