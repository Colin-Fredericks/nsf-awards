 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will extend the optical technique of generating           and detecting coherent ultrahigh frequency ultrasonics from the 100             GHz range to the THz range.  The generation of THz waves will be                accomplished by using specifically engineered quantum-well structures           of alternating AlGaAs and GaAs layers.  This quantum-well structure             will be designed to be a static image of a sound field.  Subpicosecond          optical excitation of hot electron and hole carriers and subsequent             non-radiative relaxation of the carriers in the pattern prescribed by           the quantum well structure will lead to selective excitation of                 coherent acoustic waves with the same wavelength as the well period.            The structures will be designed to provide acoustic wavelengths                 corresponding to THz frequencies.  The detection of the acoustic wave           amplitude will be accomplished by using a specifically designed single          quantum well layer (optical detector layer) to follow the acoustic              strain amplitude through the modulation of the exciton resonance.               Theoretical modelling of the optically driven strain fields, through            both non-radiative relaxation and photostriction effects, will be               carried out in parallel with the experimental studies.  The                     propagation and transmission of these high frequency acoustics at               interfaces and within the periodic well structure will also be                  treated.  This work will provide an all optical acoustic transducer,            compatible with diode pumped micro laser sources, as a future                   generation of acoustic devices for imaging.",
