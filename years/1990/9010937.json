 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because a relationship exists between diet and the chemical                     composition of the consumer's tissue, paleoanthropologists have                 focussed attention on the chemical analysis of human skeletal                   remains.  Through study of trace elements such as strontium and                 the isotopic ratios of carbon and nitrogen, it is often possible                to gain insight into foods consumed during an individual's                      lifetime.  In most archaeological excavations food remains -                    especially plant foods - are absent because of poor preservation,               and, therefore, skeletal analysis provides the only means to                    reconstruct subsistence.  While, in practice, these techniques                  seem to work well, the exact mechanisms by which elements are                   incorporated into tissue such as bone are poorly understood, and                without such knowledge, it is difficult to place a high degree of               reliance on the results of such studies.                                                                                                                        Dr. Stanley Ambrose and his colleagues will continue their work                 to elucidate these mechanisms.  They will conduct an integrated                 program of research comprising a series of experiments.  These                  include eleven controlled diet experiments using small mammals                  fed naturally labeled carbohydrates and proteins in different                   combinations under different simulated environmental conditions.                This will define the relationship between the stable isotopic                   composition of diet, biochemical fractions of diet, and consumer                tissues.  It will also provide insight into the effects of                      protein nutrition on collagen and apatite turnover rate.  The                   team will also analyze the isotopic composition of hair of six                  human populations in natural environments whose diets have been                 accurately quantified in longitudinal nutrition study.  These                   will provide a practical situation in which to evaluate the                     results of the laboratory experiments.  If time is available,                   bone samples from prehistoric populations will also be examined.                                                                                                This research is important because it will increase our basic                   understanding of the nutritional process.  It will yield analytic               approaches of use in a wide variety of archaeological situations.",
