 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerical analysis is of importance in an increasing number                of areas, owing in part to the ever - expanding role of                         computation in the mathematical sciences.                                            Many algorithms in numerical analysis use polynomials                      orthogonal on (a subset of) a real interval.  These algorithms                  include schemes for polynomial least squares approximation,                     Gaussian quadrature, and the Lanczos and conjugate gradient                     methods.  It is planned to develop analogous algorithms that use                polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, also known as Szego                  polynomials.  Szego polynomials are related to approximation by                 trigonometric polynomials, similarly as polynomials orthogonal                  on an interval are related to approximation by (algebraic)                      polynomials.  Szego polynomials satisfy a recurrence relation                   with few terms.  This makes them attractive to use in                           computations.  They have already been applied successfully in                   algorithms for computing eigenvalues of unitary matrices, a                     problem that arises in certain frequency estimation methods in                  signal processing.",
