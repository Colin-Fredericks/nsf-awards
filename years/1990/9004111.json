 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Harold Scheraga of Cornell                    University and Professor George Nemethy of the Mount Sinai                      School of Medicine in a research collaboration with Professor                   Adriana Zagari of the University of Naples, Italy.  The                         purpose of the collaboration is the determination of the                        preferred conformations of several short peptides that form                     structurally and functionally important parts of proteins.                      Two specific problems will be investigated.  The first                          problem is that of the nonhelical telopeptides of collagen.                     These peptides play an important role in directing and                          stabilizing the particular manner of assembly of collagen, by                   means of specific interactions with neighboring molecules in                    aggregates.  The second problem concerns several peptides                       that occur in bovine pancreatic and seminal ribonucleases                       and have been proposed to play a role in the folding process                    of these molecules.  The aim of both of these investigations                    is to establish the nature of the interactions of the                           peptides with the rest of the protein molecule and thereby                      understand their role in the folding and assembly of native                     proteins.                                                                                                                                                       Preferred conformations of the peptides will be determined by                   conformational energy computations, X-ray crystallography,                      and NMR and fluorescence measurements.  Interatomic inter-                      actions between molecules in aggregates will be modeled by                      energy computations.  Peptide synthesis and solution                            physicochemical measurements will be carried out in Scheraga's                  laboratory at Cornell.  Crystallization and X-ray structural                    determination will be done by Zagari in Napoli.  Conformational                 energy computations will be carried out by all three groups,                    coordinated by Nemethy at Mount Sinai.  The planning of the                     project and the interpretation of the results will require                      the combination of theoretical and experimental approaches.",
