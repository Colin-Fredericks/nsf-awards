 "awd_abstract_narration": "Antarctic benthic communities exist in an extremely cold and                    constant physical setting.  Although human activities have                      been conducted in Antarctica for many years, little is known                    of the biological impact of such activities.  With an                           increasing emphasis on environmental health and safety                          issues, the United States Antarctic Program is supporting                       research in these areas.  This project will focus on data                       collection designed to be used in environmental assessments,                    evaluation of environmental recovery, and environmental                         decision making.  This grant will establish a benthic                           monitoring program to compare human-impacted benthic sites                      near McMurdo Station to unimpacted sites in McMurdo Sound and                   Ross Sea.  This will involve four types of sampling and                         monitoring activities:  sediment chemistry, animal tissue                       chemistry, benthic communities, and bioassays.  Standard                        sampling and analytical techniques will be used, and will                       some include modifications for the unique Antarctic                             conditions.",
