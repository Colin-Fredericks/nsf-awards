 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to develop a new method of separation                 based on transient diffusion coupled with cyclic convection which               would reduce the cost of producing biochemicals, especially                     proteins.  Species with diffusivities that differ less than 10%                 can be sharply separated in less than an hour.  The new process                 is potentially attractive for separating delicate chemicals or                  biochemicals because molecules are processed in their natural                   solvent environment and are only subjected to gentle shear.                     There are no temperature, pH, ionic strength or other intensive                 variable changes except modest pressure variations which drive                  the flows.                                                                                                                                                      The new method can be batch, continuous, binary, or multi-                      component and promises high resolution, flexibility, and                        concentrated products.  The process features laboratory or                      production applicability, minimal development effort for new                    applications, and minimal operational labor requirements.                                                                                                       A binary, batch separation apparatus will be constructed and                    operated to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and to                   obtain quantitative data for separation of pairs and proteins.                  Through mathematical modeling, the results will be extended to                  predict separation performance of other process variations.",
