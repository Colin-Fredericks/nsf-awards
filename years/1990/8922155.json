 "awd_abstract_narration": "Receivers based upon the superconductor-insulator-superconductor                (SIS) quasiparticle tunnel junction mixer have now surpassed                    conventional Schottky-diode receivers in sensitivity, and are                   having an immediate impact on millimeter-wavelength astronomy.                  Even so, much further research is needed before this technology can             reach its full potential.  Therefore, an extensive experimental                 study of SIS junctions as millimeter-and submillimeter-wave                     detectors will be undertaken better analytical and intuitive                    understanding of SIS mixers and related phenomena, relying on the               quantum theory of mixing, with special attention to noise                       phenomena, optimum mixer design parameters, tuning structures, will             be sort, as will the appropriate capacitance for SIS junctions.                 Investigation of less widely accepted detection schemes, such as                SIN mixers, subharmonic pumping, and SIS direct detection will be               Experimentally studied.  The Nb/AlO/Nb juctions made in laboratory,             which have extraordinarily low leakage currents, will be utilized               in this work.  These junctions will be made available to the radio              astronomy community for SIS receiver devleopment.  This                         investigation should greatly contribute to the design and ultimate              sensitivity of practical SIS receivers; and may lead to the                     development of other detectors for millimeter and submillimeter                 wavelength astronomy.",
