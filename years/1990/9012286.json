 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, submitted through the ROW Planning Grant                         initiative, is designed to assist the PI in preparing a                         competitive research proposal for the National Science                          Foundation.  The topical area of research is the persistence of                 gender differences in representation in mathematics, science,                   and technical fields despite women's progress in educational                    attainment.  The PI will explore whether the positive effects                   on college attendance and completion of Catholic high school                    attendance by girls extend to positive effects on their study                   of science and mathematics.  The data base to be used is High                   School and Beyond.  The questions to be addressed are:                          (1)  What gender differences exist in mathematical and                               scientific educational experiences, as well as in                               attitudes towards these fields, among seniors in 1982?                     (2)  Do such gender differences vary by high school type                             (public or Catholic) when individual social background is                       controlled for?                                                            (3)  What are the mechanisms through which Catholic high                             schools confer possible advantages or disadvantages to                          their students?                                                            (4)  Do different types of Catholic high schools, such as                            single-sex or co-educational schools, have differental                          effects upon the achievements and enrollment patterns of                        women and men in mathematics and science?                                       The PI will use the ROW planning grant to establish                        contact with senior advisors well-versed in this type of                        research so that she can improve her statistical and                            methodological skills, to complete a more thorough review of                    the literature, and to prepare her data for the study that she                  would then propose for NSF funding.",
