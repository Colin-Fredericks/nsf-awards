 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probabilistic methods are gaining wide acceptance in the                        structural and geotechnical engineering fields and are causing                  comprehensive revisions in codes of practice.  While these methods are          being introduced in some universities at the graduate level,                    they are rarely integrated into the undergraduate curriculum.  As               a result, the overwhelming majority of civil engineers still                    graduate without any exposure to the concepts of randomness of                  material properties and loads.                                                                                                                                  The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the teaching of                 variability of material properties to civil engineering                         undergraduates.  First, the undergraduate civil engineering                     materials laboratory course will be modified.  Next, the results                will be disseminated.                                                                                                                                           In a conventional civil engineering material laboratory course,                 testing is typically done on a single specimen.  Illustrating the               random nature of material properties requires a large number of                 tests.  To provide this capability, the existing 400-kip Baldwin                testing system will be upgraded.  The upgrade will provide                      automatic closed-loop control of the test frame and complete data               acquisition.",
