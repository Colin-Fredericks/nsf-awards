 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies on the origin and development of continental                rifts have clearly been hampered by our lack of knowledge on the                deep structure of the East African Rift.  This classic rift is                  the standard by which all others are measured.  This grant is one               of six collaborative grants which support U.S. participation in                 an international effort to conduct a cooperative study of the                   Kenyan, Federal Republic of Germany and the European Economic                   Community, with additional participation by France, Holland,                    Spain and Ireland, as well as Kenya.  This award provides travel,               per diem and miscellaneous expenses support for personnel from                  the U. S. Geological Survey which has a major role.  A                          preliminary experiment was completed in 1985.  The results of                   this experiment suggest that the deep structure of the Kenya                    Rift is different than anticipated and that the major phase of                  the project is both scientifically valid and logistically                       feasible.  The major seismic experiment is aimed at determining                 lithospheric structure in the rift and in adjacent areas.                       Structure of the sub-Moho lithosphere along the rift, detailed                  structure in the axial area of the rift, and the transition zones               between the rift and adjacent areas are the prime areas of                      emphasis.",
