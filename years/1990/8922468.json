 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      John Gainer, University of Virginia and Dr. P.A. Arundel, ICI                   Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, England.  The                          objective of the proposed research is an investigation of                       oxygen consumption in cells and tissues.                                                                                                                        The manufacture of products from living cells, whether                          microbial or animal, depends strongly on a thorough knowledge                   of the metabolism of such cells.  Dr. Gainer's current                          research at the University of Virginia is concerned primarily                   with factors affecting the production of secondary metabolites                  from immobilized microbial cells.  Work is also ongoing to                      define the metabolic needs of free and immobilized animal                       cells, in particular with respect to the oxygen consumption.                    It has been found that the oxygen consumption rate per cell                     is quite similar for both animal and microbial cells, and is                    dependent on the density of the cells--decreasing as the                        density increases.  The next step is to extend these results                    to very high cell densities.  This can be done, in the case                     of animal cells, by studying the oxygen consumption of                          tissues.  ICI, at their Pharmaceuticals Research Center near                    Manchester , England, has an active, interdisciplinary                          group involved in basic research concerning oxygen consumption                  and metabolic needs of tissues.  During a four month research                   stay in England, Dr. Gainer proposes to carry out joint                         studies at the ICI Research Center, which will involve both a                   study of the factors affecting oxygen consumption in tissues                    and a comparison of those results to previous data for                          individual cells. Dr. Gainer has had considerable experience                    in the mass transfer of oxygen to cells and living systems.                     The Metabolic Dysfunction Team at ICI has excellent facilities,                 and has approached the problem of oxygen consumption and                        metabolism from a more reaction-controlled mechanism.  The                      combination of the two viewpoints, along with the facilities                    necessary for obtaining data, should complement each other                      well and allow for a more complete description of the entire                    oxygen consumption process.",
