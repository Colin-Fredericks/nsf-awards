 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Leonardo Seeber and Susan Hough from the                Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory (L-DGO) of Columbia University            in a research collaboration with Renato Funiciello and Antonio                  Rovelli of the National Institute of Geophysics in Rome, Italy.                 The principal objective of this earthquake research collaboration               is to use measurements of ambient noise to study resonant modes of              sediment-filled valleys.  For high-noise urban environments located             on sediment-filled valleys, the ambient noise method shows                      promise in the economical and quick identification of predominant               resonance frequencies.                                                                                                                                          Awareness of and interest in resonant modes has risen dramatically              partly because of recent large earthquakes.  Many of these were                 especially devastating to people and property due to sediment                   resonances.  This joint U.S.-Italy collaboration will provide an                opportunity to combine instrumentation from the two countries as                well as exchange ideas and experiences in understanding sediment                amplification and its relevance to seismic hazard.",
