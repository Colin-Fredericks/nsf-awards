 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Henk van der Werff of the Missouri Botanical Garden will               study species of the laurel genus Pleurothyrium of the American                 tropics, in order to characterize them and map their geographical               ranges and habitats.  The Lauraceae family is one of the most                   commonly encountered groups of tropical forest trees, both in the               American and Asian tropics.  The family is of great economic                    interest as well, as a source of commercial timber, edible fruits               (avocados for example), spices (cinnamon, bay leaves), and                      aromatic oils (camphor, rosewood oil).  Nonetheless, taxonomic                  knowledge of the species and genera is in a poor state, because                 of limited collections in herbaria and because the flowers and                  fruits are often inconspicuous and require dedicated searching to               collect.  Dr. Werff has targeted the estimated 35 species of one                genus of the American tropics, to begin a long-term taxonomic                   reappraisal of the family.  Considerable variation in leaf shape                and venation, in trichomes (plant hairs), and in floral                         morphology has been documented so far, and new field collections                will facilitate an assessment of the reliability of these                       features for distinguishing species in the field and herbarium.                 The taxonomic monograph of the group will include correct                       assignment of scientific species names, mapping of the geographic               ranges of species, notes on flowering and fruiting seasonality,                 description of vegetative morphology, and preliminary data on                   pollinators and likely animal dispersers of the plants' seeds and               fruits.  This effort will contribute to on-going inventory of                   tropical plant resources.",
