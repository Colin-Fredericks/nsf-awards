 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new laboratory course is being developed that combines the                    principles and methods from several interrelated areas: molecular               genetics, cell biology, biochemistry;, immunology, and developmental            biology. Four pieces of equipment have been purchased that are                  fundamental components of a modern biology laboratory: a refrigerated           high speed centrifuge, a laminar flow hood, a tissue culture incubator          and a vibratome. The equipment is being used in an introductory cell            biology course, in plant and animal physiology, in independent study            and honors research in addition to the new integrated course. The               project demonstrates important scientific principles, such as                   separation science, culture of animal and plant cells, monoclonal               antibody production, identification of biomolecules in tissues, as well         as a balanced treatment of these principles. It is also a unique                solution to limited time and resources. The college is contributing an          amount equal to the award.",
