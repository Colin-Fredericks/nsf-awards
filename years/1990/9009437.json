 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of large scale post-earthquake                                      urban search and rescue has been recognized in                                  recent foreign earthquakes (Mexico City 1985,                                   Armenia 1988).  Initial actions have been                                       taken to develop an urban search and rescue                                     response capability in the United States.                                       This effort has been based on fragmentary                                       experience.  The planning assumptions of                                        local, state and Federal response plans have                                    been of a hypothetical nature.  The Loma                                        Prieta earthquake, while not a major event in                                   terms of building collapse, does provide a                                      very useful occasion for the testing of urban                                   search and rescue (USAR) response planning                                      assumptions.  It also provides the opportunity                                  to assess the relevance of USAR training                                        programs which have been developed to date.                                     This work along with other research under way                                   on emergent group formation and rescue                                          equipment performance should provide timely                                     guidance for major investment in the USAR                                       response system which is now being                                              contemplated by local, state and Federal                                        agencies.",
