 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to gain insight into the process of                starvation-induced growth arrest in the yeast Saccharomyces                     cerevisiae.  Although growth arrest is a universal response to                  starvation, the process by which it occurs and the relationship                 between growth arrest and the characteristic physiological                      changes associated with the arrest are not well understood.                     Recently several genes have been identified whose transcripts                   exhibit distinct patterns of accumulation as cells undergo                      starvation-induced arrest.  The accumulation of these transcripts               in arrest-defective mutants will be studied to determine the time               at which the mutants stop development and, thus, to map control                 points during arrest.  The promoter of one gene whose arrest-                   specific transcript accumulation is cAMP-mediated will be fused                 to a selectable marker gene to isolate regulatory mutants.                      Mutants obtained by this selection will be analyzed to determine                whether similarly-regulated genes are essential, whether their                  expression is sufficient to induce arrest, and whether cAMP is                  directly involved in this regulation.                                                                                                                           Nutrient limitation is one of the most common stresses affecting                cell viability and growth.  Because of this, there is great                     selective pressure for cells to sense, respond to, and survive                  prolonged periods of starvation.  When faced with nutrient                      limitations, yeast, like many other organisms, ceases dividing                  and undergoes a series of characteristic morphological,                         biochemical, and physiological changes.  The proposed research                  will provide insight into the mechanism of starvation induced                   growth arrest by characterizing some of the genes whose                         expression is altered during nutrient limitation.  Because                      starvation is a universal stress, understanding the general                     mechanisms by which simple eucaryotic organisms, like yeast,                    respond to and survive starvation may well provide insight into                 these mechanisms in higher organisms.",
