 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns itself with several problems                        involving random media, namely the propagation of pulse waves and               the focussing of singularities of solutions of the nonlinear                    Schroedinger equation.  In particular, the principal investigator               will study direct and inverse problems for pulse reflection of                  waves in random media, reflection and transmission of gravity                   waves in irregular channels, and singular solutions of the                      Schroedinger equation due to nonlinear focussing of light beams.                Such problems arise in a host of areas, for example, seismology,                plasma physics and nonlinear optics.                                                 Many phenomena involve the propagation of waves through                    inhomogeneous media.  Think of seismic waves travelling inside                  the earth after an earthquake.  Since the medium is not uniform                 or orderly, we call it random and scientists use a variety of                   mathematical models to help understand how local microscopic                    properties influence macroscopic ones.  The macroscopic effects                 are the the ones we can measure and they usually are of most                    interest to us.  In this proposal the principal investigator will               use analytical and numerical tools to study how waves and light                 beams behave as they travel inside of random media.//",
