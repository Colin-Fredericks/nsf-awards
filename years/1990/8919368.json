 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two potassium channels: one, K(ATP) sensitive to ATP, and the                   other, K(Ca, V), sensitive to calcium and voltage, play a pivotal               role in excitation-secretion coupling in beta cells of the                      endocrine pancreas.  Both channels are glucose sensitive,                       implicating them as part of the cell glucose sensing mechanism,                 linking glucose stimulation to insulin secretion.  Previous patch               clamp studies have shown that the K(ATP) channel modulation by                  glucose is mediated via inhibition of a protein kinase A-                       dependent phosphorylation process.  The proposed patch clamp and                biochemical studies primarily aim to demonstrate that glucose                   induced K(Ca, V) channel inhibition is mediated via protein                     kinase C (PKC) and G protein activity.  From our preliminary data               it is hypothesized that the K(Ca, V) channel possesses a G                      protein binding site that is occupied either by an active, non-                 phosphorylated, alpha subunit of Gk (alpha k), or following an                  increase of PKC activity, by the phosphorylated inactive form                   (alpha k.P), the binding of alpha k.P resulting in channel                      inhibition.  It is further proposed that activation of PKC                      following production of diacylglycerol in response either to                    increased glucose metabolism or to activation of phospholipase C                by alpha k, is essential for K channel modulation.  This finding                of PKC and alpha k regulation of K channel activity will permit                 the formulation of a model which will integrate the function of                 various insulin secretagogues that modulate beta-cell function                  via protein kinases and G proteins.                                                                                                                             Investigation of the role of the individual components of the                   second messenger cascade, particularly the \"G protein\"-protein                  kinase C interaction in potassium channel regulation will be                    essential for the understanding of the chain of events linking                  glucose stimulation to insulin secretion in pancreatic beta                     cells.  The results of these studies promise, in addition, to                   shed new light on the regulation of ion channels by second                      messenger molecules in a wide variety of other cell types.",
