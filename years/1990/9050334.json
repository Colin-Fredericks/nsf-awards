 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, serving 81 less well-prepared                          teachers of grades 5-12 is directed primarily towards the                       improvement of science education in rural Minnesota through                     the enhancement of subject matter competency and pedagogy.                      The objectives of the program are: to improve the subject                       matter competency of teachers; to generate and increase                         collaboration and cooperation among teachers of different                       grade levels; to develop leader teachers who will work with                     their peers within their own and other school districts; and                    to enhance further the expertise of master teachers from                        throughout the country.  These objectives will be                               accomplished through: summer workshops in earth science, life                   science and physical science; an academic year inservice                        program, and; a year-long program for master teachers who are                   called Guest Instructors.  Three Guest Instructors, one for                     each subject area, will be selected from a national pool of                     applicants.  Each will become a member of the appropriate                       department at the college during one summer and academic year                   and will teach part-time, assist Gustavus professors during                     the summer workshops, aid in the evaluation of the workshops,                   assist in the preparation for the next summer, and serve as                     the principal figure in conducting the academic year                            inservice program.  Nine teachers, three each from middle,                      junior high and senior high school, will participate in each                    of three summer workshops.  Each workshop would be made up of                   three teams-one from each school level-that would act as                        cooperative learning groups.  Each team would use content and                   pedagogy presented during the workshop to prepare projects                      for implementation into the classroom at the appropriate                        grade levels.  Workshop participants would range                                geographically from rural Southern Minnesota during the first                   year to all of rural Minnesota during the third year.                           Coordinators of some of Minnesota's 33 rural education                          districts have played a role in the planning of the project                     and will aid in selection of teachers, project dissemination                    and coordination of activities of the new teacher leaders.                      During the academic year, each Guest Instructor will assist                     each of the participants who were in the summer workshop in                     the preparation for and the presentation of the lessons                         developed in the workshops.  He/she also will encourage and                     assist qualified teachers to become leader teachers as they,                    in turn, prepare to work with other teachers.  School                           districts will provide some financial assistance for in-house                   facilities as well as released time for the leader teachers                     to visit other classrooms.  The NSF share of this project is                    $368,123 which is matched by $262,379 from Gustavus Adolphus                    College.  The matching funds are more than 71% of the grant                     amount.",
