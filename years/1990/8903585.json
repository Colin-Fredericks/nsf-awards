 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based on previous work in the Sahara Desert of Southern Egypt,                  Dr. Fred Wendorf and his colleagues have discovered cultural                    materials of surprisingly early date.  Archaeological excavations               at the sites of Gebel Nabta and Bir Kiseiba yielded rare bones of               domestic cattle and occasional potsherds dating to about 9,500                  years in age.  Sites dating to ca. 8,100 years ago have yielded                 grains of domestic barley, and domestic sheep or goat were                      recovered from contexts earlier than 7,000 years ago.                           Unfortunately, these finds were made before techniques had been                 developed for the radiocarbon dating of very small samples, and                 because it was not possible to date them directly, doubt has been               case on these ages.  Therefore, Dr. Wendorf and his colleagues                  will return to the Gebel Nabta region for one season of fieldwork               and conduct a carefully controlled excavation to recover                        additional materials.                                                                                                                                           Through many years of research in the Sahara, Dr. Wendorf and his               colleagues have challenged traditional archaeological                           interpretations of cultural development.  Intensive research in                 Asia had produced evidence that argued that many hallmarks of the               Neolithic revolution - the shift from hunting and gathering to                  reliance on domesticated plants and animals and the use of                      pottery - first occurred in the Near East.  From this perspective               Northern Africa was a backwater and the Neolithic, when it                      appeared, was introduced from the outside.  Dr. Wendorf's work                  suggests that the story is much more complex and that some                      elements, such as cattle, first appear and were probably                        domesticated in this region.                                                                                                                                    What matters most is not the history - what first appeared where                - but the processes which underlie the events.  Possibly the                    single most important transition in human prehistory is the shift               from hunting and gathering to the domestication of plant and                    animal species.  Archaeologists cannot agree on what caused this                change to take place.  Some have argued that increased population               is the cause, while others contended that climatic changes which                forced human and non-human populations to interact in new ways                  are responsible.  Because of the excellent environmental data                   collected over decades by Dr. Wendorf and his team, it may be                   possible to arrive at a definitive answer, in this region at                    least.                                                                                                                                                          This research is important because it increases our understanding               of the processes which underlie the development of complex                      societies such as our own.",
