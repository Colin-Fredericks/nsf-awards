 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is to study how two organ systems are integrated          to regulate fluid and electrolytes in birds.  In mammals the output of          the kidneys (the urine) is conveyed to a storage organ, the urinary             bladders.  This urine, once it leaves the kidneys is not modified.              Birds do not have urinary bladders to store the urine.  Instead the             urine is conveyed by the ureters to the terminal segment of the                 gastrointestinal tract (the cloaca).  The urine does not remain here.           It is carried into the colon by a reverse action of the colonic muscle          layers.  In the colon, the urine formed by the kidneys can be modified.         How the kidneys and colon of birds are integrated into a unit that              functions in a concerted fashion to maintain the fluid and electrolyte          balance is not understood.  The research outlined in this proposal is           directed toward answering some aspects of this basic question.  A               second aspect of the proposal deals with the chemistry of nitrogen              excretion in birds.  Mammals (including humans) excrete the majority of         waste nitrogen as urea, a very water soluble compound.  Birds excrete           waste nitrogen in the form of uric acid, a very water insoluble                 compound.  Excreting nitrogen as uric acid could lead to problems of            kidney stone formation as it does in humans.  However, birds excrete            large amounts of uric acid without forming kidney stones.  How this             occurs is not understood.  A portion of this grant proposal deals with          research that is directed toward answering this very fundamental                question.",
