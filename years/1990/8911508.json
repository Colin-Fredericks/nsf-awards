 "awd_abstract_narration": "The history of 20th century particle physics has typically been                 periodized around the epochal breaks of theory:  quantum                        discontinuity (1900), special relativity (1905), general                        relativity (1915), quantum mechanics (1926), quantum field theory               (1948) and so on.  Dr. Galison argues, both in his prior work                   supported by his Presidential Young Investigator Award, and in                  this project, that there are traditions of instrumentation with                 the same degree of complexity and partial autonomy that we                      usually ascribe only to high theory.  Furthermore, these                        instrumental traditions carry with them characteristic forms of                 experimental demonstration and therefore play a primary role in                 the acceptance and rejection of new empirical phenomena.                                                                                                        Dr. Galison is also investigating two interrelated features of                  instrumentation:  1) the split of particle physics detectors                    early in the 20th century into an instrument tradition that                     produces highly resolved \"Golden Events\"  (e.g. the cloud                       chamber, the nuclear emulsion, the bubble chamber), and a                       competing instrument tradition that produces \"high statistics\" --                vast numbers of events with relatively little information                      contained about each event (e.g. the Geiger-Muller counter, the                 spark chamber, the wire chamber);   2)  the profound division of                research labor, beginning in the 1930's and accelerated in                      wartime weapon projects) that prevents one person from                          participating in all aspects of the experimental enterprise.                    Together the enormous expansion in scale and the tension between                two traditions provide a framework in which to locate a history                 of particle detectors.                                                                                                                                          Particle physics detectors are the site where experimental work                 in physics has undergone the greatest mutation.  By tracing the                 history of this inner sanctum of the experimental physicist, one                gains insight not only into the changing historical sense of the                very term \"experiment,\" one also sees in a different light the                  connections between physics and the wider technological culture                 in which it is situated.",
