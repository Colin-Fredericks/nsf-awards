 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coupling of carbon from primary producers to bacteria can                       significantly influence the patterns of vertical flux of organic                matter in the ocean.  Because bacteria must hydrolyze particles                 before uptake, bacterial exohydrolases must assume a central role               in carbon flux from particulate organic matter into the microbial               loop.  The expression of bacterial exohydrolase is regulated by                 substrate concentration and therefore may cease in waters                       depleted of particles and polymers.  In high latitude waters                    there is no phytoplankton production during the protracted polar                night.  The hypothesis to be tested is that during the Antarctica               winter, the production of bacteria exohydrolase ceases.                         Therefore, particles and polymers produced during the early                     spring bloom cannot be utilized by bacteria.  Exohydrolases are                 expressed when organic matter accumulates to a critical level;                  consequently, the coupling between particulate organic matter and               bacteria becomes strong.  Field and laboratory manipulations will               examine environmental cues which regulate exohydrolase                          activities.  This knowledge should contribute to the                            understanding of biological production mechanisms and variability               in the pathways of organic matter cycling in the Southern Ocean.",
