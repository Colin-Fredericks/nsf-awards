 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important goal of the Multitracers Project is to                        quantify paleoproductivity (defined as organic carbon flux out                  of the euphotic zone) off the coast of Oregon from the peak of                  the last glacial maximum to the present. By accomplishing this                  goal the PIs will also develop paleoproductivity tracers that                   can be applied elsewhere in the oceans, and establish the                       limitations of each tracer. Three sediment trap moorings                        forming a transect away from the Oregon coast are a key aspect                  of the tracer calibration. The approach is to apply multiple                    tracers for productivity-the bulk organic fraction, inorganic                   elements (Cu,Zn,Ba), organic geochemical biomarkers, and                        microfossils-to determine when all give consistent information                  and to determine when each begins to track paleoceanogrphic                     variables other than productivity. Funding is provided for an                   additional field season for the Multitracers Project,                           consisting of two 6-month trap deployments at the two inshore                   sites. The high-solution sediment trap data and the water                       column information from the springtime should enable to                         adequately define winter-spring produtivity events in the                       region. In addition, the three-year time series of sediment                     trap fluxes will help understand the interannual variability of                 productivity in the California Current. This represents a                       modification to the previously-funded project entitled                          \"Multitracers to predict paleoproductivity in the California                    Current System from sediment and sediment trap materials\"                       (OCE-8609366).",
