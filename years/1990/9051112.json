 "awd_abstract_narration": "A computer algorithm in execution is a dynamical object.  To                    understand how a particular algorithm works, one has to visualize               the dynamical changes that occur to the state of the algorithm at               each step of its execution.                                                                                                                                     Traditional classroom technology, such as chalk and blackboard or               viewgraphs and overhead projectors are inadequate to illustrate the             dynamics of the execution of algorithms.  Therefore instructors are             faced with difficulties in carrying out simulations of algorithms in            the classroom.  This is a problem in almost every course in Computer            Science, since algorithms form a central part of the discipline.                                                                                                The advent of relatively cheap high resolution fast graphical                   workstations makes it possible to simulate the execution of an                  algorithm, and display dynamically appropriate graphical                        representations of the state of its execution on a screen.  The                 result of these simulations is an interactive \"movie\" of the                    execution of the algorithm providing students with immediate visual             feedback about the concepts being explained.                                                                                                                    This project equips a classroom and implements curricula adjustments            to take advantage of the new environment.  Key components consist of            high resolution graphics workstations connected to a special output             device that permit students to view workstation displays on a large             projection screen.                                                                                                                                              The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
