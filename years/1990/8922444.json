 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Ralph Byers of the University of                  Kansas for collaborative research in mathematics with Professors                Angelika Bunse-Gerstner and Volker Mehrmann at the University of                Bielefeld, Federal Republic of Germany.  They are working on                    numerical methods for structured eigenvalue problems and control.                                                                                               The distance from a controllable pair to the nearest uncontrollable             pair is closely related to the conditioning of  control problems.               The collaborators will design numerical methods to measure such                 distances.  They will study real, complex and structured perturba-              tions.  This work will help engineers amd scientists to recognize               ill-conditioned problems and to formulate mathematical models hat               avoid ill-conditioning.  Structured eigenvalue problems arise                   frequently in control and other engineering and scientific                      computations.  Progress in numerical mehtods has lagged behind                  progress in computer architecture, so it is difficult to take                   advantage of the parallelism and theoretical peak computation rate              of advanced computers.  The collaborators will assemble a set of                basic procedures for structured eigenvalue problems.  By designing              computer algorithms that exploit the mathematical properties of                 structured matrices, this work will help engineers and scientists               solve large computational problems.",
