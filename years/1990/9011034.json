 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to incorporate principles of fluid dynamics,                heat and mass transfer with knowledge of mineral and aqueous                    chemistry.  Ultimately, this will lead to an integrated approach                concerning the behavior of minerals and fluids resulting from                   changes in state conditions caused by fluid flow, and the                       physical manifestation of such processes.  Identification and                   quantification of the dominate factors involved in fluid                        circulation allows one to predict and describe where the most                   vigorous fluid mineral reactions will occur.  Integration of                    fluid dynamics will hopefully lead to new innovative methods of                 exploration and frontiers of discovery in fluid-mineral systems.                     The proposed activities are designed to obtain an indepth                  working knowledge of dynamic fluid systems, to acquire necessary                skills to expand the research program into this area, and to                    develop innovative research methods applicable to these systems.                Activities will concentrate on processes and mechanisms                         associated with fluid motion, emphasis of concepts describing                   transport theory, the physics of fluid dynamics, the mathematical               tools and constructs required to formalize the problem, and the                 computational and numerical techniques necessary to obtain and                  visualize the results.  Integration of fluid dynamics, with                     traditional mineralogic approaches and theoretical methods from                 aqueous geochemistry and irreversible thermodynamics, will more                 fully permit the explanation and prediction of chemical                         alteration caused by flow of fluids.",
