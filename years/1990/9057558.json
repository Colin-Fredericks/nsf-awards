 "awd_abstract_narration": "As shared-memory multiprocessors are scaled to a large number of                nodes, coping with the large latency for memory references becomes a            major challenge.  In general, there are two complementary approaches            for managing latency: (i) methods that reduce latency for accesses,             and (ii) mechanisms that help tolerate large latencies.  While both             approaches are important for general-purpose parallel architectures,            it is preferable to first reduce the latency for accesses before                trying to tolerate the latency.  This is because techniques which               depend on tolerating latency demand a much larger degree of                     parallelism in order to successfully overlap communication and                  computation.                                                                                                                                                    This project explores and evaluates novel techniques to deal with the           latency problem.  The research will be done in the context of DASH              (Directory Architecture for Shared Memory), a scalable shared-memory            multiprocessor currently being built at Stanford.  The two major                topics investigated are: (i) the use of weak memory consistency models          to help reduce the latency for write operations, and (ii) the use of            prefetching techniques to hide latency for both read and write                  operations.",
