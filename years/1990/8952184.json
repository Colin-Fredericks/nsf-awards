 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to modernize and expand the Neurobiology              and Animal Physiology laboratories in the Biology Department at                 Wake Forest University.  The science of physiology is the analysis              of function in living organisms.  Physiology should be a part of                any well-rounded undergraduate biology curriculum.  Physiology can              serve as a bridge between molecular biology and behavioral and                  ecological biology.  Neurobiology, which includes the physiology                of the nervous system, is a growing area of biology as evidenced                in the increasing number of participants at the annual society for              Neuroscience Meeting and the increase in funding in that area.                  Laboratories in neurobiology (neurophysiology) and physiology give              undergraduate students a chance to manipulate and examine systems               which they can relate to their own bodies.  Many of the students                taking these courses are preparing for professional careers in                  medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine.  Physiology                       laboratories give students an opportunity to test their manual                  skills and dexterity which they may use in their future careers.                                                                                                The Neurobiology and Animal Physiology courses are taught in                    alternate semesters and the new equipment will be used in both                  courses.  The new instrumentation will have several effects.  (1)               It will free research equipment that the P.I. is now using to teach             the Neurobiology laboratories.  (2) It will allow more students to              take the Neurobiology lab.  (3) It will allow for an increase in                the number of experiments performed in Animal Physiology.  (4) It               will allow students in Animal Physiology to do the same experiments             at the same time.  (5) It will introduce students to the use of                 computers in physiological science.  The grantee is matching this               award with non-federal sources.",
