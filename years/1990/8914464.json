 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study heterogeneous                    (multiphase) reactions of SO2 and NO2 in laboratory-generated                   clouds.  Specific questions to be addressed in the proposed                     research are:                                                                        What is the role of water phase change (form vapor to                      condensed cloud drops) in scavenging and oxidation of SO2   in                  the presence of ammonia and other atmospheric gases?                                 What is the effect of water phase change on NO2 scavenging                       and chemical transformation?                                                   What is the effect of different cloud condensation nuclei                  (including those produced by combustion) on these processes?                         The approach to answering these questions involves the use                 of the LBL cloud chamber.  Such an approach is advantageous                     because chemical and physical processes that occur in a system                  with dispersed water drops may be significantly different from                  those proceeding in a bulk system.  These differences are                       related to the uptake of gaseous species into drops and the                     effects of chemical and physical properties of cloud                            condensation nuclei on liquid water composition, drop                           concentration, and size distribution.",
