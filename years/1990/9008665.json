 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do people select patterns of movement for carrying out                 everyday tasks?  Casual observation of people manipulating                      objects or walking in cluttered environments can obscure the fact               that a selection process is required, for under normal                          circumstances people select movements without conscious                         deliberation even though infinitely many movements are usually                  possible at any given time.                                                          In approaching the problem of movement selection, a possible               theory is that the actor learns to perform specific movements in                specific contexts: \"If the nail is so high, swing the hammer so                 far,\" and so forth.  This theory is unappealing, however, because               memory might not be able to store all required condition-action                 pairs and the actor might be unable to perform in novel                         situations.  A preferable theory says there are a small set of                  constraints which limit the number or types of movements that are               allowed.  Identifying the smallest and most powerful set of                     constraints is the aim of this research.  Finding such                          constraints will further the basic understanding of human                       performance and decision-making and also aid the design of                      robotic systems, the diagnosis of motor disorders, and the                      development of effective motor-skills training and retraining                   procedures.                                                                          The research will involve two series of experiments.  One                  will test the hypothesis that the relative contribution of an                   individual limb segment to movement of an end-effector (for                     example, the fingertip) depends on the degree of match between                  the optimal movement characteristics of the segment and the                     required movement of the end-effector.  A virtue of this proposed               control strategy is that each limb segment can be independently                 controlled.  Nevertheless the collective activations of the                     segments can still produce graceful, coordinated movement. The                  detailed assumptions and predictions of the model will be tested                in experiments where people will move the fingertip at varying                  rates over varying distances, where the relative contributions of               the forearm, hand, and finger will be analyzed.                                      Another series of experiments will be concerned with object                manipulation.  These experiments will identify the sources of                   three newly discovered phenomena concerning people's choices of                 hand grips when taking hold of simple objects to be moved from                  one location to another: (1) A strong tendency to tolerate                      awkward postures when first taking hold of the object for the                   sake of comfort at the end of the task;  (2) An equally strong                  tendency to select movements that ensure the visibility of the                  target at the end of the task, even if this conflicts with the                  postural comfort criterion; and (3) The tendency to persist in                  using a particular movement pattern when that pattern has been                  used repeatedly in immediately preceding tasks.",
