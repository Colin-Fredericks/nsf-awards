 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination            theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners             under that competition.                                                         Traditional support for coordinating the activities of collaborative            software engineers consists mainly of version control and mail                  systems and does not meet the requirements of many software                     engineering tasks such as interactive group design and debugging.               In this project the researchers investigate flexible coordination of            the activities of cooperating software engineers.  In particular,               they develop an approach allowing: (1) a range of concurrency                   control mechanisms including serial transaction, concurrent                     serializable transactions, concurrent non-serializable transactions             allowing other transactions to access various types of partial                  results, and not control; (2) alerters automatically informing users            of events in which they are interested; (3) dynamic variable-grained            locking, and (4) live sound integrated with the concurrency control             mechanism.  In the development of the approach, the researchers use             results from the work done in shared windows, long transactions,                distributed interactive systems, and other systems.  The researchers            also study how a particular scheme can be automatically chosen by               the system based on a minimum performance level requested by the                user.  Several prototype applications will be developed to                      demonstrate the novel aspects of this research.",
