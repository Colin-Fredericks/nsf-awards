 "awd_abstract_narration": "This cosmology project will measure the isotropy of cosmic                      microwave background radiation (CMBR) that was emitted early in                 the formation of the universe.  The measurements will be made at                wavelengths both longer (approximately 3 millimeters) and shorter               (less that 1 millimeter) than the peak in the CMBR spectrum.                    Because these radio waves are strongly absorbed by the                          atmosphere, especially water vapor, South Pole Station, which is                the second driest inhabited place on Earth is the best place to                 make these measurements (the Soviet Antarctic Station Vostok is                 slightly colder and drier).  In addition, the circumpolar motion                of the celestial sky means that any spot in the sky can be                      watched through a constant thickness of atmosphere for any length               of time, which is also a great advantage.                                                                                                                       To date all measurements of the CMBR have shown the radiation to                be isotropic, that is, it comes from all directions with equal                  intensity.  It is clear that this cannot be true at very small                  variations in intensity nor at all angular scales, any more than                the likelihood that the sky would be uniformly bright in visible                light.  The amount of variation, and angular scale of those                     variations are sensitive tests of the theories of the creation                  and early history of the universe.  This project is a search for                these expected variations.",
