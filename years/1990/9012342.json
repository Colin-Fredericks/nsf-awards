 "awd_abstract_narration": "The initiative to map and sequence the human genome is entering a               critical period.  For the next five years, the organizational                   structures for accomplishing its goal of obtaining the complete                 sequence by the year 2005.  The choices made in the early 1990's                will define the basic outline of the technological system for                   mapping and sequencing the human genome.  This period is thus a                 strategic research opportunity of exceptional importance for                    understanding the evolution of the genome project, with a more                  general significance for sociology and history of science and                   technology.  Dr. Hilgartner is undertaking a study of how the                   agenda for research, for organizational design, and for policy of               the genomics community takes shape during this critical period.                 The system/network approach to technology, and the concept of                   agenda-setting, provide a theoretical framework.   The research                 will use a prospective, longitudinal study of a cohort of key                   informants from the community, in-depth interviewing, and                       participant observation in carefully selected laboratories.",
