 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four aspects of the biology of Recent stalked crinoids in                  the Straits of Florida are examined as they contribute to                       understanding paleoecological processes: 1) niche partitioning of               habitat and food among four species distributed as three                        sympatric pairs--does it support or refute tiering, hydrodynamic                and food partitioning hypotheses proposed for fossil taxa.                      Measured variables include current velocity, stalk height, crown                diameter, filter density, gut contents and available food; 2)                   larval recruitment contributions to aggregated versus scattered                 populations; contributions of recruitment and relocation of                     vagile adults in re-establishing aggregations following physical                disturbance; 3) relationship between possible behavioral                        patterns (feeding, activity or locomotory patterns or cycles) and               variations in current regime and 4) skeletal contributions of                   Recent crinoids to sediment as an analogue for depositional                     processes in ancient crinoidal sediments--analyses of post-mortem               processes and potential preservational biases.  Work will be                    conducted via submersible, time-lapse cinematography,                           morphological, photographic and sedimentological analyses of                    collected material.  Isocrininds represent major components of                  macroepibenthic assemblages in the study area and have a fossil                 record dating to the Triassic.  As such, they represent an                      excellent analogue for paleoecological processes.",
