 "awd_abstract_narration": "I propose to make a detailed study of oxygen isotope                       relations in volcanic rocks in the Comstock lode mining district,               Nevada, where a relatively small (75 km2) zone was affected by                  intense circulation of meteoric-hydrothermal fluid, resulting in                regional propylitization and in the formation of important                      epithermal Au-Ag deposits.  Oxygen isotope data will be used to                 map the circulation pattern, to identify infiltration-related                   isotopic disequilibrium effects, and to characterize the fluid                  sources and the temperature distribution in the ancient                         hydrothermal system.  Data from surface samples will be augmented               with data on samples from mine workings in order to construct the               first detailed 3-dimensional image of a hydrothermal system in an               important mining district.  I anticipate that the research will                 disclose critical relationships between circulation patterns and                geologic factors that will advance understanding of these systems               and that may be invaluable guides to ore deposits.  The study                   will also advance knowledge about the regional geologic framework               of our continent, and will provide fundamental data about the                   geologic environments and processes in which convective systems                 participate.",
