The workshop, to be held at the Center Ettore Majorana in               Erice, Italy, aims to bring together scholars from a number of                  disciplines:  biology, psychology, anthropology, history who are                examining the causes of abuse of infants, as well as the factors                influencing the investment of resources in them.                                                                                                                The capacity for parents to protect their offspring is an essential             component of reproductive success in species in which there is                  parental care.  Only recently has the phenomenon of infanticide,                defined as the killing of preweanling young by members of the same              species, been viewed within the context of evolutionary biology.                Prior to the late 1970's the killing of infants by conspecifics                 was generally viewed as an aberrant behavioral response to a                    breakdown in social structure.  A conference on Infanticide in                  1982, and the subsequent book, served as the impetus for a                      considerable amount of research over the last 7 years.  This                    workshop will serve an important function in reviewing the latest               findings and discussing future directions.",
