 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rich archaeological record of the central Andes in South               America provides an unparalleled opportunity for the integrated                 study of human biology and culture.  A long history of human                    occupation documents inter-regional population movement and                     interaction, as well as local changes in economic strategies and                a continual restructuring of social organization and group                      identification.  Investigations of this complex history are                     enhanced by the presence of well-defined, extensive mortuary                    sites that hold potential for examining a variety of topics                     important to the interpretation of Andean prehistory: social                    organization, demography, activity patterns and role-related                    behaviors, diet, and nutrition.  Of special relevance in coastal                arid environs is the remarkable preservation of mummified                       tissues, as well as other fragile items rarely encountered in the               archaeological record.  These include textiles, basketry, wooden                objects, and plant and animal tissues.                                               The proposed project focuses on three issues: (1) resource                 production and consumption (2) patterning of genetic                            relationships within and between groups, and (3) status                         distinctions, as represented in interments.  The investigation is               significant in that it will provide data to distinguish between                 the two contrasting models of the interrelationships of                         archaeological sites in the region: the \"horizontality\" model of                Rostworowski, and Murra's \"verticality\" model.",
