 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded under the Special Initiative on Coordination            Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of eleven winners             under that competition.                                                         This research is directed towards integrating concepts from                     artificial intelligence, organization theory, and operations                    research into a single framework.  The research argument is that the            plans, organizations, and schedules studies in these separate fields            can share a common representation, and are simply different                     abstractions of a behavioral specification.  The PI develops a                  hierarchical, multi-dimensional specification for behavior that                 subsumes traditional goal, plan, functional and product hierarchies.            the research outlines a protocol for coordination based on the                  behavioral specification, where intelligent agents incrementally                exchange behavioral information and search through alternative                  behaviors to resolve conflicts and promote cooperation.  The                    research also implements and evaluates this framework both in the               context of cooperative robotics domain, and in the context of an                intelligent systems for scheduling meetings between people.  The                objective is to generate scientific and technological advances using            a novel, interdisciplinary approach to coordination.",
