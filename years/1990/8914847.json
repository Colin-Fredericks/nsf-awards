This proposal plans to examine the                                 microstructures and mechanical properties of aluminum                           base alloys using a series of metallic elements.  It                            addresses an important problem in metallurgy and is a                           valuable line of inquiry which to date has seen little                          research effort.  This study can make significant                               contributions to the understanding of structures and                            mechanical properties of rare earth alloys.  The supply                         of rare earth alloys for this research is to be provided                        by the Chinese P.I., since eighty percent of world                              deposits of these rare alloys are located in China.                             This research can significantly advance our under-                              standing of the whole class of A1-Si alloys, which are                          currently widely used in automotive engines in the U.S.",
