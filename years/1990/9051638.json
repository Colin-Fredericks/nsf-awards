 "awd_abstract_narration": "The institution acquired an Infowindow System to expand and                     improve its learning Center.  This enabled the college to promote               an appreciation and understanding of chemistry in the community                 as well as strengthen the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.                                                                                                   The developed for the system are used for chemical technicians                  employed in area industry, for middle and high school students in               the area, and for curriculum students at the college.                                                                                                           This project extended the educational opportunities to chemists                 working in the industries, allowed middle school and high school                students to come in contact with more elaborate and sophisticated               applications in chemistry, and allowed more interesting and                     challenging laboratory experiences for the college's curriculums                students.  This project also resulted in the development of new                 video programs in chemistry, reduced health hazards, allowed new                experiences for students, and permitted students with                           disabilities to perform some labs that otherwise they would not                 have been able to accomplish.                                                                                                                                   The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
