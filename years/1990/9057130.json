 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Daniel E. Kahne will be supported as a Presidential Young                   Investigator by the Organic Synthesis Program.  He will be                      studying how the attachment of carbohydrates to a peptide                       alters its structure and in so doing modulates the biological                   activity.  New methods of synthesizing glycopeptides will be                    developed in order to facilitate the necessary                                  structure-function studies.                                                                                                                                     The first step involves working out strategies to synthesize                    glycopeptides.  Currently a glycosylation method is being                       developed that can be used to attach sugars to amino acids                      rapidly and in good yield.  Glycopeptides will be incorporated                  using solid phase synthesis.  This will primarily involve                       manipulation of protecting group schemes so that the                            carbohydrate moiety can be deprotected and the glycopeptide                     cleaved from the resin without hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds.                                                                                                  The glycopeptide sequences will have been chosen from                           systemswhere there is evidence that the carbohydrate induces a                  conformational change in the peptide.  Initial studies will be                  confined to peptide sequences of six to eight amino acids.                      Proton NMR will be used to compare the structure of the                         glycopeptide with its nonglycosylated analogue to evaluate the                  effects of the attached carbohydrate.  Assignments and coupling                 constants can be obtained from homonuclear (phase-sensitive)                    and heteronuclear correlation spectroscoyy.  Through-space                      interactions (dipolar coupling) obtained from NOESY or                          spin-locked (transverse) NOE spectroscopy will give information                 about the solution conformations.  Additional information about                 conformational structure and dynamics can be obtained by                        measuring amide exchange rates and relaxation times.  The                       studies should begin to give a better understanding of how                      attached carbohydrates can modulate secondary structure in                      glycosylated regions of proteins.",
