 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program of research is designed to improve our                     understanding of the chemical evolution of seawater during the last             600 m.y. of Earth history.  To accomplish this, we plan to extend               our analytical data base for the chemical composition of brines in              fluid inclusions trapped in halite (NaCl) in marine evaporites.                 Many of these brines are samples of the solutions from which the                salt precipitated.  In marine evaporites these brines are largely               or entirely derived from seawater; their composition therefore                  reflects the composition of seawater at the time of salt                        precipitation.  In many instances the evolution of these brines                 from seawater has been so complicated, that little information                  regarding the composition of the parent seawater can be gained from             the composition of the inclusion fluids.  Fortunately, the                      evolution of the brines in some marine evaporites has been                      sufficiently simple, so that much of the chemistry of the starting              seawater can be reconstructed.  The data accumulated to date                    indicate that the composition of seawater has been surprisingly                 conservative during the past 600 m.y.  At present these data are                still fragmentary.  We propose to extend them considerably, and to              construct a reasonably complete record of the composition of                    seawater during the Phanerozoic Eon.",
