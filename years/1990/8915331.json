 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will support a cultural                      anthropologist who will study a trans-national movement                         (\"Habitat\") that builds homes for low-income people in the USA                  and in India.  The student (a native of India) will conduct                     ethnographic research in the organization's headquarters in                     Georgia as well as in a housing site in Massachusetts and one in                India.  The questions to be dealt with include the nature of the                identification of individuals with the movement, the variation in               the ideology and practice of the movement as expressed in its                   activities in the US and the Indian site, and the dynamic of the                grass-roots nature of the movement as expressed in its day-to-day               administration.                                                                                                                                                 This research is important because trans-national movements are                 of growing significance in the contemporary world.  The analysis                of how this movement deals with homelessness, another issue of                  great contemporary concern, can produce information that can help               us understand similar behavior in other countries.",
