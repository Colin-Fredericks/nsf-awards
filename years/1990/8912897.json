 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Abraham M. Lenhoff of the University of           Delaware for collaborative research with Professor Klaus K. Unger of            the Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry of Johannes                Gutenberg University, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany.  The objective        of their research is to gain a better understanding of the role of              adsorption and desorption kinetics in hydrophobic interaction chroma-           tography (HIC) of proteins.  The information sought is significant for          both analytical and preparative systems.  It sets a fundamental limit           for the speed of microanalytical separations, and it provides rate              information that can be important in optimizing the design and operation        of preparative columns for this form of chromatography.                                                                                                         Two complementary analytic approaches will be used, both involving the          same proteins, surface characteristics and solvent compositions.  The           first involves the use of Total Internal Reflectance Fluorescence (TIRF)        spectroscopy for the direct, real-time measurement of adsorption and            desorption kinetics and equilibria on a flat slide.  The second uses            HIC with a 1.5 micron non-porous stationary phase to examine behavior           in actual column chromatography under conditions where kinetics are             likely to be rate-limiting.  Comparison of the results of the two sets          of experiments will be made possible by the transport and kinetic               modelling of the respective systems.  The planned cooperation combines          the TIRF capability and the modelling strengths of the Delaware group           with the surface synthesis expertise of the Mainz group.",
