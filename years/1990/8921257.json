 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze four separate, but                   related topics dealing with asset markets.  (1) This  part will                 involve time-series modeling of the stock and bond markets and                  their relations to the macro economy.  The correlation between                  returns in the stock and bond markets will be examined to see to                what to extent it is consistent with efficient markets models.                  (2) Markets for single family homes will be modeled and analyzed                in the second part of this project.  The degree to which this                   market may be considered efficient will be better specified.                    (3) Direct study of investor behavior will be undertaken using                  questionnaire-survey experimental methods, with the objective of                learning how institutions can be modified to help serve the                     public better.  For example, the reasons for the failure of the                 CPI futures markets and markets for other indexed instruments                   will be studied.  (4) If and important event occurs in the                      financial markets, like the stock market crash of 1987, data will               immediately be collected and analyzed regarding investor behavior               during the crisis period.  This project is important because it                 will shed important new light on the operations of stock, bond                  and housing markets.",
