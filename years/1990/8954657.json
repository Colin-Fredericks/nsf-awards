 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of the Lawrence Hall of Science (LHS),                             University of California at Berkeley, will develop and                          disseminate a mathematics and science methods course, a                         teacher's science curriculum guide, and a motivational video                    designed for preschool educators.  The project is in response                   to the need for improving the science and mathematics                           knowledge and teaching skills of preschool teachers.  To                        accomplish this goal the project will develop and test a 70                     hour course for early childhood educators.  The inservice                       course will provide teachers with  an introduction to science                   and mathematical concepts through the ecological sciences,                      participation in activity-based lessons, experience in                          adapting and teaching science content and process to                            preschoolers, observation of preschool programs, and                            development of a plan-of-action for the implementation of                       their own preschool science program.  A revised science                         curriculum resulting from the course will be produced as a                      Teacher's Science Curriculum Guide available at the end of                      Year Two.  During the third year, the project's materials                       will be disseminated through conference training sessions for                   an additional 400 preschool educators, and during year four                     the evaluation of the training materials will be completed.                                                                                                     The cost sharing for the project will be thirty-eight percent                   of the NSF award.",
