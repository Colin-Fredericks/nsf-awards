 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this ROW/CAA (Research Opportunities for Women/ Career                  Advancement Award) project, Dr. Linda Strausbaugh at the                        University of Connecticut proposes to study the evolution of the                histone gene family in the Drosophila willistoni species complex.               The histones are a class of proteins universal in living                        organisms which, because of their functional importance in                      chromosomes, have been highly conserved by evolution. Strausbaugh               has found evidence of histone gene variation among closely                      related species of the D. willistoni complex and proposes a                     series of experiments to test theories about the evolution of                   histone genes. Dr. Strausbaugh is a molecular geneticist                        attempting to carry her research into the realm of evolutionary                 biology. Under the ROW/CAA program she will continue her work                   initiated while on sabbatical leave at Yale University during the               1989-90 academic year; specifically, she will \"re-tool\" her                     laboratory for studies in molecular evolution, initiate several                 new projects and complete the projects initiated at Yale.",
