 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate objective of this research is to understand the molecular          mechanisms that determine orderly chromosome segregation during mitosis.        Two aspects of chromosome segregation, sister chromatid disjunction and         spindle elongation, will be studied in vitro using the fission yeast,           Schizosaccharomyces pombe.  We have shown that in permeabilized cells of        the mutant strain nuc2, which are arrested at metaphase, spindle                elongation and chromosome movement can be reactivated in the presence of        ATP and neurotubulin, but sister chromatid disjunction cannot.  We will         extend this in vitro functional analysis to wild type and other mutant          strains arrested at appropriate stages of mitosis.  We will describe the        roles of microtubule sliding and polymerization during anaphase spindle         elongation in vitro, the conditions required for reactivation of sister         chromatid disjunction, and the roles of kinases in regulating these             processes.  In vitro complementation using spindle proteins prepared            from functional permeabilized cell models or specific gene products             produced in E. coli will be used to describe the roles of these proteins        during mitotic events.  Antibodies prepared against known spindle               components or against gene products identified by genetic analysis will         be used to interfere with in vivo mitotic function.  Combined with an           analysis of mutant phenotypes in vivo and localization of proteins by           immunofluorescence, this analysis will be useful for understanding the          role of specific gene products in chromosome segregation.                                                                                                       The development of a functional in vitro model for chromosome                   segregation in a genetically manipulable organism could play a                  pioneering role in the field of mitosis.",
