This project is a comprehensive                  national effort to stimulate and amplify efforts to strengthen                  the mathematical sciences at the undergraduate level.  The                      primary objective of the planning period is to develop and                      disseminate an intellectual agenda for undergraduate mathematics                that can guide the National Science Foundation, the MAA, and the                broader mathematical community.  A secondary objective is to                    initiate a broad-based dialogue about this agenda both within the               mathematics community and with the many external constituencies                 whose own efforts are loosely linked to collegiate mathematics.                      The project's long-term goals are to promote curriculum                    reform; to identify and publicize examples of effective                         innovation; to reshape faculty attitudes; to improve quantitative               literacy; and to align assessment with appropriate curriculum                   objectives.  The MAA will convene a series of focus groups to                   help identify issues and recommendations, will enlist its twenty-               nine regional sections to initiate grass-root discussions, and                  will prepare a report for wide distribution.  The MAA plans to                  extend this project in subsequent years to help promote                         widespread implementation of effective approaches to collegiate                 mathematics.",
