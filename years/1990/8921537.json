 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project extends and completes experimental investigations of               English common value auctions, common value auctions with                       asymmetric (insider) information, and learning processes in                     experimental auction markets.  The project also finishes a case                 study of the bidding process in the Houston construction                        industry.  Under the previous NSF grant the investigators found                 conclusive evidence of a \"winner's curse\" (winning bidders suffer               losses) in English auctions.  This is an important result                       methodologically because it contradicts existing theories of                    bidding and it is important substantively since the English                     common value auction is a widely used mechanism for auctions.                                                                                                   The experiments employed an English clock procedure whereby                     prices start at the lowest possible value for the item and                      increase steadily.  Bidders are active until they signal their                  intention to drop out of the auction, which decision is                         irrevocable for the sale of that item.  The last active bidder                  wins the item, paying the price at which the next to last bidder                dropped out.  The experiments demonstrated that the dropout                     prices of losing bidders reveal information to the other bidders                and reduce but do not eliminate the winner's curse.  Further                    research should provide new and useful insights into institutions               and practices that mitigate or eliminate entirely the winner's                  curse in auctions.                                                                                                                                              The case study of the construction industry in Houston is                       especially interesting.  In order to determine the                              generalizability of the auction market findings, the                            investigators conducted a series of low price, common value offer               auctions in comparing the performance of student subjects with                  experienced professionals from the Houston construction industry.               Qualitatively similar behavior was found across subject pools as                in both cases bidders suffered from the winner's curse, losing                  money as a consequence of winning the item, and increasing the                  number of bidders exacerbated the losses.  These results raised                 an important question: Why are business executives successful in                real world auctions and unsuccessful in laboratory auctions?  The               case study identifies a number of real world institutional                      features and practices that reduce the effects of the winner's                  curse.",
