 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study problems in                          Lorentzian, Riemannian, and pseudo-Riemannian geometry.  He will                build from his earlier work involving a Lorentzian analogue of                  the Cheeger-Gromoll splitting theorem of Riemannian geometry.                   This work will entail an analysis of the existence of timelike                  lines in space-times obeying suitable curvature, causality, and                 completeness conditions.  In another vein, he will use minimal                  surface theory to demonstrate the simplicity of spacial topology                near a black hole.  Lastly, he will investigate as to whether                   compact pseudo-Riemannian manifolds have closed geodesics.                           The principal investigator will study several problems                     related to the geometry of space-time.  Einstein was the first to               suggest that the universe is a four-dimensional dynamic                         hypersurface which both restricts the movement of masses and is                 curved by their gravity.  In this project, mathematics developed                for the study of more general hypersurfaces will be applied to                  the specific hypersurfaces which are used to model our space-                   time.",
