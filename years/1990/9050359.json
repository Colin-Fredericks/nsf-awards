 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project SEED is a 33 month program sponsored by Northeastern                    University to enhance middle level science teachers' use of                     experiments, demonstrations and projects in their classes.                      It is based on the well-established notion that an                              understanding of the basic concepts requires extensive prior                    experience with concrete examples of these projects.  Working                   with an advisory group of science supervisors and                               coordinators from both urban and suburban Boston-area                           schools, a comprehensive program has been developed to train                    teachers to incorporate demonstrations and experiments into                     their individual teaching styles.  The principal component of                   Project SEED is a four-week summer program, held for two                        summers, which involve workshop sessions, seminars and field                    experiences.  Twelve day-long workshop sessions will focus on                   demonstrations and experiments that will give middle-school                     students concrete experience with the basic concepts and                        physical laws that underlie all of science.  Topics covered                     include: length and time; area and volume; mass and density;                    pressure and weather; force, work and energy; motion; earth                     and the solar system; elements and compounds; optics; heat                      and temperature; and electricity and magnetism.  Each                           workshop session will involve a variety of activities that                      can be adapted to a diversity of teaching situations and                        curricula.  Participants will also help build museum-style                      exhibits.  These exhibits will be designed to give the students                 a joyful interaction with science, spark their interest and                     curiosity and to provide them with some hands-on experiences                    which may not otherwise be available.  Aiding the participants                  in the workshop activities and the museum projects will be two                  teacher interns who have been selected from previous summer                     workshop programs.  Arrangements have been made with public                     utilities, private corporations and government laboratories for                 special seminars and tours aimed at connecting curricular                       material to everyday industrial and scientific practice.  There                 will also be seminars and visits to research laboratories at                    Northeastern University. Prior to the summer program, two                       seminars and site visits will be held with the participants to                  assess their individual needs, interests and strengths, and the                 facilities available to them.  After the summer program, the                    participating teachers will meet individually with members of                   the Project staff to develop a set of goals for implementing                    workshop ideas in their classes.  Follow-up seminars and site                   visits will be conducted to help the teachers meet their                        specific goals.     A formative evaluation procedure will be                    used to help the teachers assess how much their teaching                        benefited from the program.  The NSF share of the project is                    $326,169 which is being matched by $206,952 from the                            institution.  This constitutes a match of more than 63%.",
