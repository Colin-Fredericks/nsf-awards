 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collections in the Museum of Geology of the South Dakota               School of Mines (roughly 20,000 specimens, mostly fossil                        vertebrates) is one of the best representations of the richly                   fossiliferous terrains nearby.  New building space has been                     allocated to the collection, providing for many years of                        expansion.  Dr. James Martin, curator of the collections,                       proposes a program of reorganization and improvement, including                 purchase of steel storage cabinets, leading to eventual                         computerization of the collection catalog.   The collection is                  actively used for research, public exhibit, and education.                           The proposed collection improvement program will greatly                   improve the long-term use of these important fossils.  Visiting                 researchers will have greater access to specimens, and new                      research collections will be made available more rapidly than was               previously possible.  The Museum's collections have the potential               to become the nucleus for regional research in vertebrate                       paleontology, and the proposed facility improvement will promote                this potential.",
