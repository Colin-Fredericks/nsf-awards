 "awd_abstract_narration": "The many-body problem in quantum mechanics is well-known for its                complexity, but with the aid of supercomputers it should be                     possible to increase the accuracy of calculations by several                    orders of magnitude.  The use of supercomputers, however,                       presents many problems - new methods and new approaches need to                 be developed.                                                                                                                                                   The long-range goal of this project is to develop parallel                      algorithms for atomic structure calculations, based on the proven               multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock method (MCHF), that execute                     efficiently on vector/concurrent architectures such as the shared               memory Cray Y-MP and the distributed memory Intel iPSC-RX                       hypercube.  The first task is the revision of the finite                        difference methods used by MCHF to spline based methods for which               higher accuracy and better vectorization properties have been                   achieved.                                                                                                                                                       The use of splines in MCHF atomic structure calculations, leads                 to large, sparse, generalized eigenvalue problems for which only                a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors are needed.  Often the problem               is a non-linear, generalized eigenvalue problem.  Another                       frequently occurring problem is the solution of large, sparse,                  structured systems of equations where parts of the matrix are                   dense.  Vector/concurrent algorithms for these problems will be                 developed and incorporated into an atomic structure package based               on the MCHF method.",
