 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discharge of cnidae, the stinging cells of cnidaria, requires               that appropriate and concomitant chemical and mechanical stimuli                be received.  The goals of this research are to elucidate the                   cellular and molecular mechanisms whereby supporting cells in the               tentacles of sea anemones chemosensitize adjacent cnidocytes to                 discharge cnidae in response to triggering mechanical stimuli.                  Experiments have been designed to test critical aspects of a                    comprehensive model of chemosensitization.  The model proposes                  plausible functional relationships among the currently identified               components of the chemosensitizing system of the cnidocyte-                     supporting cell complex.  Essential features of the model are:                  1) Chemoreceptors and sensitizing systems are located on                        supporting cells.  2) The chemosensitizing system primes the                    triggering contact mechanoreceptor by simultaneously elevating                  intracellular levels of calcium and depolarizing the cell                       membrane, and 3) Supporting cells are coupled to adjacent                       cnidocytes.                                                                                                                                                     This study of the mechanisms controlling the discharge of the                   stinging cells of sea anemones will yield valuable insights into                cellular and molecular mechanisms of sensory transduction,                      stimulus-secretion coupling, intracellular sensory integration,                 and intercellular communication in these relatively primitive                   multicellular organisms.  It should, further, provide new                       approaches to studying symbioses between animals of this and                    other groups of animals, and new information about the mechanism                of self recognition in cnidarian species.  In addition, the                     results of this research may suggest ways of protecting humans                  from the stings of sea anemones and jellyfish.",
