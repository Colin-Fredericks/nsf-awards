The dynamics of ecological                   processes as well as impacts from disturbance often are                         measured by changes in vegetation.  Traditional methods of                      vegetation analysis are labor intensive, slow, and as a result,                 they often are confined to small-scale measurements.  Many                      current research topics (i.e. climate change) require analysis                  over very large areas, and although remote sensing from space                   is providing unprecedented information, validation of satellite                 imagery with large-scale vegetation analysis is lacking.                             A new, ground-based methodology has been developed by an                   interdisciplinary group at the University of New Mexico that is                 significantly increasing the ability of scientists to study                     environmental dynamics across a range of scales and allow                       integration with reflectance measurements from satellite                        instruments.  The new technology requires image analysis                        algorithm research and development and the integration of new                   image acquisition hardware.  The resulting system will provide                  near ground level acquisition of stereo images and detailed                     analysis of three dimensional information on a computer                         workstation.  Three dimensional information from reflectance                                                                                                    imagery is currently not available from any source, yet this                                                                                                    information can lead to improved species identification and                                                                                                     quantification of volumes (biomass) instead of just surface                                                                                                     areas.  It represents a major advance in image analysis                                                                                                         technology for ecological studies.                                                                                                                                   A highly qualified team of investigators will address the                                                                                                  problem.  Institutional facilities for image analysis and                                                                                                       remote sensing are excellent.
