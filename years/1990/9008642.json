 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will continue this important line of research on the                  dynamics of wages and unemployment in labor markets characterized               by the disappearance of old jobs and creation of new ones.  This                is a dimension of labor market dynamics that has not received                   much attention in macroeconomics; yet, it is essential to                       analyzing a number of central issues in macroeconomics such as                  inflation and price setting and the dynamics of aggregate                       employment.  The authors have already developed an explicit model               of the flows of workers in labor markets with continual job                     creation and job destruction; derived the implied behavior of the               major aggregates, unemployment, and job vacancies; and begun                    constructing a wage determination model in decentralized markets.               This continued research will extend the theoretical models of                   labor dynamics and will involve additional empirical work using                 Canadian employment data which tends to be of higher quality than               available US data.  The authors will also continue to analyze the               US employment data.  This research is important because it will                 provide a better basis for understanding the persistance of high                unemployment rates which have plagued the US and other developed                economies to various degrees over the past twenty years.",
