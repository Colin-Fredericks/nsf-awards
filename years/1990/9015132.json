 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Susan E. Allan's doctoral-dissertation research is to               study the characteristics of sound signals that are important in                communication.  Such temporal properties as waveform periodicity,               pulse repetition rate, and amplitude modulation are known to be                 important in acoustic communication of anurans (frogs and toads).               Anurans are ideal animals to work with when studying acoustic                   communication.  They communicate with small, well-defined                       repertoires used to attract mates, defend territories, and                      recognize species.                                                                                                                                              Extensive work has been done on the sensitivity of the female                   green treefrog to temporal properties of the male's calls, but                  little experimental work has been done on the detection and                     behavioral responses of the male green treefrog to these same                   signals.  Because males and females of some species are known to                differ in behavioral and neurophysiological responses to a given                signal, it is important to examine the significance of particular               acoustic properties for males and females independently.  Ms.                   Allan's research will focus on the sensitivity of the male green                treefrog to the rate of amplitude modulation in the species'                    calls.  This question will be investigated using three different                experimental methods:  laboratory evoked calling, field playback                experiments, and a psychophysical method, reflex modification.                  Thus, the project will relate both behavioral and psychophysical                results with the behavior of the animal in its natural                          environment.",
