 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Graphics represents a new discipline in engineering curricula          and a significant new tool for Engineering Design and Drafting.  The two        week seminar is incorporating 16 participants with the faculty                  continuing as their mentors both during and after the completion of the         seminar.  The seminar includes presentations, discussions,                      demonstrations and other forms of interaction between participants and          faculty that aid in teaching and research in the area of Engineering and        Computer Graphics.  A follow-up meeting a year later at the annual ASEE         Conference will include presentations of research papers initiated              during the seminar and discussions of the course development efforts            made by participants at their home institutions.  This project attracts,        interests, enlightens and initiates those experienced and promising             undergraduate instructors teaching traditional Engineering Graphics,            needing motivation, background and know-how in developing new  Computer         Graphics laboratories and applying leading-edge technology to the               teaching of modern, CADD-based Engineering Graphics courses.  Also,             participants are motivated in becoming self-reliant in making their own         research contributions to the field of Engineering Education.                                                                                                   The home institutions are contributing the travel costs for their               faculty to attend the meeting.",
