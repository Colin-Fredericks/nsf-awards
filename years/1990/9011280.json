 "awd_abstract_narration": "I/O system performance has become and will remain an important                  research focus as processor speeds continue to improve faster than I/O          system speeds.  Because there presently exists no accurate way to               measure I/O system performance, it is hard to objectively evaluate new          I/O system designs.                                                                                                                                             A measure for I/O performance that simulates measured system workloads          is being developed.  The few studies of I/O system workloads to date            have failed to consider: (i) mixtures of both file system activity and          paging activity, (ii) CPU overhead of I/O system calls, (iii)                   variations of I/O activity across different application domains (e.g.           business vs. scientific applications), and (iv) interarrival timings            of I/O requests.  Detailed measurements of these factors in I/O system          performance, will be made and used to construct a comprehensive                 measure of I/O system performance.  This measure can be used to                 compare I/O system designs and to balance processor performance with            I/O system performance.  Preliminary measurements indicate that a good          balance between processor and I/O performance is currently rarely               achieved.  Results for these studies will make it possible to analyze           performance tradeoffs for new I/O system designs.",
