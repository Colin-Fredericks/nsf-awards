 "awd_abstract_narration": "An essential criterion for assessing fruitful areas of science and              engineering cooperation between U.S. and foreign investigators is               the probability that long-term relationships beneficial to the                  U.S. communities can be established.  A key provision in the                    Mexican government's science policy is to support the development               of a few key fields in science and technology, one of which is                  plant biotechnology.  Moreover, the existence of species in                     Mexico that are not indigenous to the United States can provide                 unique research opportunities for U.S. scientists.                                                                                                              Dr. Arntzen's plan to make an in-depth assessment of the                        capabilities at existing Mexican centers of research in this                    field will be of considerable value in advancing scientific                     cooperation in an important and unique area that Mexico has                     targeted for support.  He will lead a team comprised of three                   other U.S. plant biotechnologists to three research sites in the                country to meet with Mexican investigators and to determine the                 feasibility of research cooperation on specific projects.  They                 may also begin to develop detailed plans for cooperative research               if they determine that such plans would be in the best interests                of U.S. research efforts in plant biotechnology.  Following the                 visit, Dr. Artnzen will prepare a written assessment of Mexican                 capabilities in the field that will be made available to the                    relevant research community in the United States in the expectation             that that report will provide a broader basis for planning                      cooperative research projects with Mexico.",
