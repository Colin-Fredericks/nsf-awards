 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funding for instrumentation to further                   develop a comprehensive and integrated core facility for the                    structural characterization of peptides, proteins and nucleic                   acids and their organic synthesis for use as reagents.  The PIs                 propose to purchase an automated DNA sequencing instrument to                   facilitate the analysis of DNA sequences.  In addition to the                   major users of DNA sequencing, the PIs have a relatively large                  number of users who sequence a few KB of DNA per year that could                benefit from this instrument.                                                                                                                                   Currently one of the major services of the existing core                        facilities is in the synthesis of oligopeptides and                             oligonucleotides.  Demand for synthetic peptides is increasing                  for use as  models of protein structure and function and the                    production of anti-peptide antibodies.  Anti-peptide antibodies                 are useful reagents for identifying gene products and probing the               relationships between protein structure and function.  The rate                 limiting step in the production of synthetic peptides has become                the purification of the desired product by HPLC as most of the                  users do not have their own chromatography instrumentation.                     Funding for critical supporting instruments such as liquid                      chromatographs to purify synthetic peptides and capillary                       electrophoresis equipment to assess purity is also requested.                   Chromatography equipment is requested for the isolation of                      proteins prior to sequencing.",
