 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased co2 will have major impacts on plants---                         including increased photosynthesis, increased growth, decreased                 water use, and decreased tissue nitrogen.  These changes will be                even more intense in legumes which have symbiotic nitrogen-fixing               bacteria.  Rates of nitrogen fixation are often determined by                   available photosynthate or size of nodules.  The impact of                      increased co2 on two species of lupines (Lupinus) will be                       investigated at the Duke Phytotron.  These plants have nitrogen-                fixing nodules and thus are likely to have increased rates of                   fixation as co2 concentrations increase.  In addition, lupines                  have alkaloids as their anti-herbivore defense compounds.  Since                alkaloids contain nitrogen, increased co2 is very likely to                     impact on alkaloid concentration as well.  To study this                        interaction, lupines will be grown under three different                        concentrations of co2 and three different levels of foliage                     damage.  Foliage from these plants will be analyzed for changes                 in chemical composition, and will be fed to a native species of                 herbivore, Orgyia vetusta.  This research is the first to                       investigate a three-level interaction between a plant, its                      nitrogen-fixing symbiont, and herbivore.  Results will be of                    great interest to those studying atmosheric gases and global                    change issues.",
