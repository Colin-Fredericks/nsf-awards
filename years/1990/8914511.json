 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of a group of US                      mathematicians to attend a joint US-French seminar on the topic of              representation theory and harmonic analysis of p-adics group, to                be held in Marseilles, France in June 1990.  The US organizer is                Dr. Phillip Kutzko, University of Iowa.  The French organizer is                Professor Guy Henniart, University of Paris XI.                                                                                                                 The representation theory and harmonic analysis of reductive p-                 adic groups has gained great significance over the past two                     decades, both because of its intrinsic interest to non-abelian                  harmonic analysts and because of its relationship to number theory              and the study of automorphic forms through what has become to be                known as the Langlands program.  Work in this area has been marked              in particular by close collaboration between US and French                      mathematicians.  The proposed seminar will bring together leading               US and French specialists and will focus on the following topics:               1) the admissable dual 2) Howe duality 3) local harmonic analysis               with applications to the trace formula and 4) local factors.                    This seminar will provide a timely opportunity to review recent                 developments in this area and to further future cooperative                     research.",
