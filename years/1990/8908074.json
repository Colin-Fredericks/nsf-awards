 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to examine some of the processes by which blood               pressure is regulated.  Normally, the brain sends messages to                   arteries and veins through nerves.  Activation of these nerves                  causes the blood vessels to contract by releasing a chemical                    messenger, norepinephrine.  The receptor molecules for                          norepinephrine which are on the surface of the muscle cells in                  the blood vessels will be studied.  Dr. Minneman has previously                 shown that there are several different types of such receptors,                 which are affected differently by various drugs.  He will now                   study the molecular mechanisms by which these different receptor                types cause the blood vessels to contract.  He is particularly                  interested in whether these receptors are acting through                        different mechanisms to cause contraction, as is suggested by                   preliminary results.  Identification of these different                         mechanisms will be important in understanding more about how                    blood pressure is regulated, and in helping to identify ways to                 selectively control blood pressure. //",
