The U.S. organizer                          is Lane Hirabayashi of San Francisco State                                      University.  His counterpart is Teofilo Altamirano of                           the Catholic University of Peru.  The workshop will                             focus on how migrants draw upon values and forms of                             social organization from their areas of origin to                               facilitate adaptation to urban life.  The participants                          consist of ten scholars who have carried out                                    first-hand field work in large Latin American cities,                           who have a strong interest in comparative analysis,                             who have not had a chance to work together or                                   coordinate their research results and who have                                  emphasized countries where there is clear evidence of                           ethnic identification on the part of rural-urban                                migrants.  These countries are Bolivia, Ecuador,                                Mexico and Peru and there is a representative from                              each one among the workshop participants.                                                                                                                       All of these scientists and the U.S. experts have                               published extensively on urban adaptation and each                              will write a specially commissioned paper on the                                regional culture in the Latin American city of their                            expertise to reflect the dynamics of rural-urban                                linkages.  Because of the impact such studies have on                           understanding the growing problem of urban migration                            in developing countries, this workshop is a timely and                          important one for the Science in Developing Countries                           program.",
