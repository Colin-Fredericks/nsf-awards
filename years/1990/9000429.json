 "awd_abstract_narration": "Argonne National Laboratory along with the University of                      Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, Northwestern                    University, and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory propose                   that an NSFNET NSS be located at the Argonne main facility in                   Chicago.  The Argonne National Laboratory is a large,                           multiprogram facility owned by the U.S. Government and operated                 by the University of Chicago under contract with the U.S.                       Department of Energy.                                                                                                                                           This proposal will provide a major access point to NSFNET, to                   CICnet, and to the National Research and Education Network.  It                 will provide access to national resources by the academic,                      government, and industrial research enterprises in the Chicago                  area and provide access to major research resources located in                  the area by scientists throughout the nation.  These resources                  will be made even more accessible by establishing an interagency                gateway at Argonne between NSFNET, ESnet, MILNET, and the NASA                  Science Network.                                                                                                                                                Furthermore, Argonne and its four partners in this proposal are                 committed to provide whatever support may be needed to ensure the               success of the node in providing excellent NSFNET access service                in the Chicago area for inbound and outbound network traffic.***",
