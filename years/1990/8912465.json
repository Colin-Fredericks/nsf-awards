Castillo, Division of Marine Geology and Geophysics,                            University of Miami,  to pursue with Dr. Raymundo S.                            Punongbayan, Philippine Institute of Volcanology and                            Seismology, for a period of 24 months, a program of                             cooperative research on the arc magmas from Camiguin                            Island, southern Philippines.  The main objectives of this                      study are to (1) investigate the apparently regular cycle                       of vulcanism on Camiguin Island, (2) identify the most                          probable differentiation mechanisms responsible for this                        pattern of igneous activity, (3) constrain the source                           composition of magmas erupted from Camiguin and Balatukan                       (on nearby Mindanao Island) volcanoes, (4) compare and                          contrast the magma source composition of Camiguin and                           Balatukan with those of volcanic centers in the eastern and                     western arcs of northern Philippines, and (5) model the                         long-term history of the suprasubduction mantle beneath the                     Philippines to determine whether it was mid-ocean ridge                         basalt, ocean island basalt, or sub-continental type.                                                                                                           The collaborators expect the results of this project to                         lead to a better understanding of the nature of Camiguin                        volcanoes and, hopefully, to predict future volcanic                            activity on the island.  In addition, results of the                            project will help earth scientists gain a comprehensive                         understanding of the source of island arc magmatism.  The                       present project will allow these highly respected                               scientists to combine their talents and interests for                           mutual benefit.  This project is relevant to the objectives                     of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks                      to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.                               scientists and engineers and their counterparts in                              developing countries through the exchange of scientific                         information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
