 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project makes important methodological and                        substantive contributions to our understanding of business                      regulation.  Methodologically, most of the sizable literature on                regulatory behavior assumes that the regulator is a \"first-mover\"               in the regulatory setting and is able to commit to incentive                    mechanisms which induce the regulated firm to truthfully reveal                 its private information or undertake costly hidden actions.  This               project examines regulatory price and standard setting where                    regulators are often unwilling or unable to make credible                       commitments to specific regulatory actions or policies.                         Substantively, the research provides new insights into                          technology-forcing standards.  Technology-forcing regulations are               those in which the agency writes a standard that is costly, or                  even impossible to meet using current technology.  This is an                   important and interesting class of problems because technology-                 forcing standard setting is used in environmental regulation,                   regulation of product and occupational safety, and regulation of                product efficacy and durability.                                                                                                                                The project focuses on the effects of limited regulatory                        commitment on sequential equilibrium pricing and investment                     strategies by regulated firms.  First technology-forcing                        regulation is studied in a standard setting context.  The                       incentives for the firm to invest in new compliance technologies                and the intertemporal evolution of standards are emphasized.                    Second, the project considers a model of price regulation in                    which the regulator determines the firm's rate structure after it               has made its investment in capital.  Third, the effects of                      regulatory commitment on the quality of service are studied.",
