 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of oncogene-containing retroviruses will be examined for               their ability to infect fetal thymocytes.  The infected cells                   will be introduced into lymphocyte-depleted fetal thymus                        rudiments which are known to supply all of the factors necessary                for thymocyte proliferation and differentiation.  Infection will                be assayed by the ability of virus-infected cells to induce foci                or drug-resistant colonies in NIH 3T3 cells.  The criterion for                 successful infection will be the establishment of persistently                  infected lymphocyte populations which can proliferate within                    rudiments and which have the phenotypic properties known to be                  associated with thymocyte progenitors.  This strategy will                      identify candidate oncogene-containing retroviruses which can be                used in attempts to establish temperature-sensitive progenitor                  cell lines.                                                                                                                                                     T-lymphocytes are one of the major cell lineages that comprise                  the cells of the imune system.  There are two major difficulties                that currently impede study of T-lymphocyte differentiation:  1)                the relevant progenitors are minor constituents of a                            heterogeneous population of cells, and 2) there is no simple in                 vitro system that permits the clonal expression of thymocyte                    progenitors in quantity.  This project, if successful, will                     develop a cell culture system that would permit isolation of                    cloned populations of thymocyte progenitors in quantity and the                 study of their differentiation into mature thymocytes.  Although                at present this research must be regarded as \"high risk\", the                   potential for the use of such a system in basic studies                         of T-cell development is very great.",
