 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dennis Lichtenberger is funded by the Experimental                    Physical Chemistry program of the NSF.  His work includes                       studies on new metal compounds of gas samples as well as thin                   films by irradiation of samples with high energy light and the                  observation of the thin film samples by electron microscopy.                                                                                                    This work by Professor Lichtenberger focuses on the features of                 metal-metal interactions in a wide range of chemical                            environments such as strongly bound ligands, weakly bound                       molecules and coordinated surfaces. Knowledge of these                          interactions contributes to the understanding of important                      fundamental chemical, catalytic and physical processes                          involving metals. One of the primary goals of this work is to                   come to a better comprehension of chemical bond making and                      breaking. The longer range goals of the project include an                      understanding of the relationship between the structure,                        bonding and reactivity of transition metal compounds.",
