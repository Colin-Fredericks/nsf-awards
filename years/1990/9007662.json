 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in the Turkana Basin of northern Kenya are currently               yielding important evidence of the development of early humans in               East Africa.  Few localities are as ideally suited to answer some               of the major questions being asked in paleoanthropology today.                  This is largely due to the extent of our knowledge of the                       detailed stratigraphic relations, chronology and environmental                  significance of the deposits which enclose the fossils and                      artifacts there.  Expanding the geographic range of that                        knowledge to peripheral areas of the basin holds considerable                   promise, as recently discovered deposits there represent habits                 thus far poorly known.  This proposal is for continued study of                 the tephrostratigraphy of the Turkana Basin sequence and of other               distal deposits (including the Awash Valley, Baringo Basin and                  Lake Albert Rift) erupted from the same sources in order to allow               temporal integration of these widespread localities.  In                        addition, continued study of the detailed stratigraphy and                      paleoenvironmental context of the Turkana Basin deposits will                   further refine our understanding of the context from which one of               the richest record of early humans has been recovered.",
