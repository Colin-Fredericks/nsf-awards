 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new program of research will be initiated in the                         dynamical evolution of strong gravity systems in cosmology and                  astrophysics.  This will involve the study of effects of                        quantum matter near the end point of a stellar gravitational                    collapse  including backreaction effects in spherically                         symmetric spacetimes.  The quantum behavior of the early                        universe will also be investigated by study of the boundary                     condition of its wave function in an alternate approach.  The                   universe will be described by a density matrix consistent with                  some partial knowledge, in the same manner as any other                         ordinary quantum systems.                                                            The goal of this research is to: 1) explore the                            limitations to the presently known laws of physics, and 2)                      uncover the need for possible modification to extend them                       outside of their known range of validity.",
