 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this project is to elucidate                         mechanisms of development in early mammalian embryos through the                period of gastrulation. TGF-beta2, a mammalian peptide growth                   factor having a variety of effects on different cells, can induce               mesoderm in animal pole cells of the amphibian embryos in a                     process resembling normal induction. The related factor, TGF-                   beta1, may play a subsidiary role in this process. Expression of                the mRNAs for these two factors in peri-implantation mouse                      embryos (blastocyst to 101/2 day embryos), placentae, and uterine               decidua will be sought by in situ hybridization and Northern                    blotting. As a subsidiary goal, expression in ovaries,                          particularly in relation to the developing oocyte,, will also be                followed. The homologous probe for TGF-beta1 is currently in use                in the laboratory, and if possible, a mouse cDNA for TGF-beta2                  will be obtained using a simian cDNA probe to screen appropriate                cDNA libraries.                                                                 %%%                                                                             TGF-beta was a growth factor originally discovered as a secreted                factor that stimulated differentiated cells to a state where they               proliferate in culture. This and related growth factors have                    recently been detected in early embryos. The current study is to                determine the levels and subcellular locations of two related                   factors during early mammalian embryogenesis.",
