 "awd_abstract_narration": "To study thermodynamic properties of multilayer films of various                adsorbates on uniform surfaces of graphite and other substrates.                The technique, currently used by them and by one group in                       Germany, combines ellipsometric measurement of coverage with                    vapor pressure measurement by conventional capacitance manometers               or by modified manometers operating at low temperature adjacent                 to the sample.  Among the phenomena which will be studied are                   surface roughening and surface melting behavior of krypton,                     xenon, and methane films on graphite, including detailed                        examination of the layer critical points and inverse critical                   points which occur in fourth and higher layers, at least for                    krypton; exploration of the phase diagrams of neon and hydrogen                 in the same thickness range; and wetting and layering behavior of               other interesting systems, such as carbon monoxide on graphite.                 Other substrates will be examined besides graphite, including                   TiS2, TaSe2, and other layered dichalcogenides, cleaved surfaces                of ionic crystals such as LiF and MgO, and gold films evaporated                on mica.  A number of improvements in the experimental apparatus                will allow better precision in coverage and pressure measurement.",
