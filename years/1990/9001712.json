 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is the analysis of classes of                      holomorphic functions of several complex variables.  The                        regularity of holomorphic functions defined in a domain becomes                 less definite as the independent variable approaches the boundary               of the domain.  This boundary behavior is the main thrust of this               activity.                                                                            Boundary properties of functions defined in a disc in one                  complex dimension are well understood.  A natural analogue in                   several dimensions is the ball.  Even in this case, information                 is far from complete.  In the study of holomorphic Sobolev and                  Besov spaces, it can be shown that functions have unique limits                 on approach to the boundary provided certain exceptional sets are               avoided.  Some progress has been made in characterizing                         exceptional sets in terms of their capacity.  Further effort will               be devoted to refining these results.  A related line of study                  will consider the complex tangential derivative of functions in                 Lipschitz classes.  It appeared that when the Lipschitz constant                is equal to one-half, the tangential derivatives in the class are               p-th power integrable for all values of the parameter. This                     turned out to be false, leading to a reconsideration of how                     functions in this class behave near the boundary.  Work will be                 done on the question.                                                                A second line of investigation concerns the restriction of                 holomorphic Sobolev spaces to complex tangential manifolds.                     There is ample evidence to suggest that the restricted classes                  are exactly the real Besov spaces.  Work will continue on the                   problem of determining when a function in such a Besov space can                be extended to a holomorphic function of the same type.",
