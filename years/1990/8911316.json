 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ciliated protozoa are widely recognized as an important component               of planktonic communities and are believed to play a pivotal role               in marine microbial food webs.  The importance of ciliates as                   consumers of phytoplankton and, to a lesser extent,                             bacterioplankton has been well studied and is now generally                     accepted.  Larger zooplankton are usually viewed as the                         predominant consumers of ciliates, yet there is little evidence                 that grazing by metazoa has a substantial impact on ciliate                     populations.  Recent studies of the parastiic dinoflagellate                    Duboscquella cachoni and its tintinnine host Eutintinnus pectinis               in Chesapeake Bay indicate that parasitism can have a significant               impact on host abundance in coastal environments where E.                       pectinis densities are sufficiently high to support epizootic                   infections.  Whether parasitism has a strong influence on other                 estuarine species or on ciliates in the open ocean where host                   densities are considerably lower is uncertain.  The importance of               parasitism to the fate of the ciliate protozooplankton in                       Chesapeake Bay will be evaluated through a combination of field                 studies to determine host-parasite abundance, species                           composition, parasite life histories and generation times.",
