 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is part of a joint project at Cornell and Duke Universities                to continue the successful research on custom hardware for solid                modelling.  Duke is extending and improving the hardware itself,                while Cornell is building software for constructive solid geometry              (CSG), integrating the resulting system with applications, and                  conducting field tests.  The initial 8-processor system is being                upgraded to 256 processors, to allow parallel processing of more                complex objects.  At the same time, the numerical precision of the              hardware is being increased, and a tag system is included to allow              the processors to keep track of software-specified properties of                parts of objects.  The software and applications are being extended             not only to use these hardware changes, but also to include                     algorithmic improvements.  Among the improvements foreseen are                  enhanced ability to translate from other representations, such as               nurbs (non-uniform recursive B-splines) and boundary                            representations, into the CSG trees that are used by this system.",
