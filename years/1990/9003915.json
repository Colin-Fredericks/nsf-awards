 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trace and minor element distributions have played a major role in               interpreting carbonate mineral formation and diagenesis in                      sedimentary environments.  Sorption and coprecipitation processes               involving carbonates also figure importantly in controlling trace               metal concentrations in near-surface waters.  However, major                    limitations in efforts to model such processes quantitatively                   result from a poor understanding of factors that influence                      partitioning of elements between aqueous solutions and carbonate                minerals, especially the abundant mineral calcite.                              Findings that surface crystal structure, and particularly the                   geometry and structure of growth steps, exert strong influences                 on selective element incorporation, offer a means by which to                   examine the very surface mechanisms that cause such selectivity                 in partitioning.  By correlating surface structural features                    imaged by differential interference contrast microscopy with                    quantitative trends of selective enrichment for various elements                over a range of conditions, the relative influences of growth                   rate and surface structure on element partitioning will be                      evaluated.                                                                      The present research project will provide insight to the most                   fundamental mechanisms operating during crystal growth,                         specifically those factors that influence trace and minor element               distribution.  In addition, this research  will lead to a                       capability of predicting differential partitioning trends that                  are element specific and their associated crystal growth rate                   effects.",
