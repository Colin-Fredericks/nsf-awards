 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the construction of a greenhouse             and for the refurbishment or acquisition of other equipnment needed             for the growth and experimental manipulation of plants.  The                    equipment will facillitate the undertaking of long term experiments             that require the growth of plants or (plant) tissue cultures under              well-defined conditions of temperature and light.                                    The recent development of techniques that permit studies of                the structure and regulation of genes at the molecular level has                stimulated renewed interest in studies of plant gene regulation and             plant development, and has added a new dimension to the study of                plant genetics.  Frequently, a crucial element in such studies is               the ability to grow large numbers of plants under highly controlled             conditions of light and temperature.  Furthermore, the use of plant             tissue cultures in such studies requires not only well controlled               growth facilities but, in addition, the use of aseptic work areas               that permit innoculation and transfer of cultures without the risk              of cantamination by bacteria and fungi.  The greenhouse and related             equipment purchased through this award will satisfy these                       requirments for a group of outstanding plant scientists at Yale                 University.",
