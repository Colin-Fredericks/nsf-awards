The goal of this investigator's                         research is to increase her understanding of biological                         treatment processes used in treatment of wastewater as                          components of ecosystems.  This approach will be used by                        her to study the interactions of chemical, physical and                         biological processes including interactions of involved                         microorganisms with each other and with the environment.                        Examples include extending her work on the role of pH                           variations in algal biofilms to nitrification,                                  denitrification and methanogenesis in wastewater treatment                      processes.                                                                                                                                                      Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                           engineering design of processes and systems for removal of                      contaminants from wastewater.  The results may be useful                        in determining how nitrogen can be removed from wastewater                      by use of a single biofilm that includes both aerobic and                       anaerobic processes within it.",
