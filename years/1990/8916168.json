 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is for continued research on a                                     general purpose, optimization-based computer-                                   aided-design methodology which will supplement                                  and eventually displace many currently used                                     heuristic techniques which form part of the                                     engineering design cycle.  Such a methodology                                   is possible because (i) a large variety of                                      engineering design problems can be transcribed                                  into the form of a very small number of                                         standard, semi-infinite optimization problems,                                  and (ii) new system theoretic results                                           facilitate the use of optimization in                                           engineering design.                                                                                                                                             The research is in three interrelated parts.                                    The first part deals with topics in                                             optimization algorithms for engineering design                                  and optimal control: (i) optimal                                                discretization procedures, (ii) superlinearly                                   converging algorithms, (iii) global techniques                                  for finding designs satisfying specifications,                                  and (iv) optimal control algorithms for                                         distributed parameter systems.  The second                                      part deals with topics in optimization-                                         oriented system theory: (i) nonlinear system                                    stabilization via moving horizon optimal                                        control, and (ii) integrated design of                                          flexible structures and their control systems.                                  The third part deals with the development of                                    an interactive software system which provides                                   an appropriate environment for optimization-                                    based computer-aided design.",
