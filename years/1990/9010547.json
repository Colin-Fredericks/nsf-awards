 "awd_abstract_narration": "As large-scale, distributed systems are used in safety-critical                 applications, the fault tolerance of these systems becomes a crucial            issue.  This research focuses on the fundamental problems of diagnosis          and fault-tolerant routing.  This work will, for the first time,                consider the coordination of these important tasks, by making use of            diagnostic information to increase routing efficiency and system                throughput.  The work will target systems possessing a relatively               sparse interconnection structure such as grids, meshes, and hypercubes          which constitute a large fraction of existing systems and are                   expected to dominate future applications.  The proposed research will           involve the integrated design of algorithms for diagnosis and routing,          along with evaluations of algorithm performance that are both                   theoretical and experimental in nature.  The theoretical work will              utilize probabilistic analysis techniques in order to evaluate                  performance under recently proposed probabilistic models as well as to          examine performance limits for these systems.  The experimental work            will involve the implementation and testing of the proposed algorithms          on 32-node Intel IPSC/2 hypercube. A product of this research should be         efficient algorithms for these fundamental problems in distributed              fault tolerance that can be used in a wide range of                             multiprocessor/multicomputer systems.",
