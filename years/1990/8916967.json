 "awd_abstract_narration": "Female northern elephant seals have a distinctive diving pattern.  They         dive deeper than other marine mammals (maximum depth of 1250 m), spend          brief periods on the surface between dives (less than 3 minutes), and           dive continuously for three months at sea.  The present studies will            determine whether a cross section of adults, juveniles and pups exhibit         the same pattern, test for the effects of pregnancy on diving                   performance, delineate the bioenergetic consequences of extreme sexual          dimorphism on foraging, and provide vital information on the                    development of diving.  Hypotheses concerning metabolism, energy                expenditure, and foraging strategies will be tested by measuring swim           velocities, matching these to other dive characteristics, and relating          surface interval duration to diving effort.  Six different diving               instruments will be used to record dive depth, dive duration, surface           interval duration and swim speed.  Changes in physiological variables           associated with the development of diving performance (e.g., blood              volume, myoglobin concentration, hematocrit and oxygen utilization)             will be monitored in pups and yearlings in the field and in diving              tanks in the laboratory.  Prolonged, continuous deep diving is unusual          and challenges several long held interpretations of diving performance.         The present studies will clarify diving adaptations in pelagic seals.           These studies have important implications for how seals partition               oxygen stores during foraging, manage anaerobic metabolites, and cope           with compression effects.",
