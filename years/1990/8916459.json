 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peroxisomes are nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells and                    have essential functions in respiration and lipid metabolism.                   Peroxisomal proteins are nuclear-encoded and are synthesized on                 free polyribosomes, then imported into pre-existing peroxisomes                 post-translationally.  Peroxisomal proteins, unlike many                        mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins, are synthesized at their                mature size and lack cleavable transit peptides.  The long term                 objective of this project is to understand the mechanism of                     peroxisome assembly.  The aims of this proposal are to identify                 topogenic sequences that act to direct peroxisomal proteins to                  yeast peroxisomes.  Previously, this laboratory determined                      conditions for measuring the in vitro import of peroxisomal                     proteins to peroxisomes from the yeast Candida tropicalis, and                  identified topogenic sequences in one peroxosomal protein                       (aceyl-CoA oxidase) that are capable of direction this protein to               peroxisomes.  Nothing is known regarding the targeting and                      insertion of peroxisomal integral membrane proteins.  The plan is               to clone and sequence a matrix and membrane protein from C.                     tropicalis peroxisomes.  Using the established in vitro assay and               by an in vivo import assay, peroxisomal targetting signals will                 be investigated and compared.  Also, the gene encloding                         peroxisomal citrate synthase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is in                hand; this will be expressed and, using the above methods, it                   will be determined whether signal sequences are conserved in                    peroxisomal proteins from C. tropicalis and S. cerevisiae.                                                                                                         By these means, it is hoped to gain a better understanding of                the mechanism by which peroxisomes are assembled.",
