 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America will conduct a four-year project        titled, \"Building Multimedia Instructional Materials to Nationally              Promote the Use of Calculator Technology in  Mathematics Classes\".  The         proposal is included in the special  solicitation, \"Projects to Promote         the Effective Use of Technology in the Teaching of Science and                  Mathematics\".  Each kit will feature a 20-minute videotape on the use of        graphing or symbol manipulating calculators to teach principles and             techniques of mathematics.  Two school districts in Texas will                  participate to become models in the use of calculators in implementing          the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Standards.  The          NCTM will provide expertise in reviewing the products in the development        stage.  The project team produced the successful video, \"Math: You Can          Count on It\", and features a number of prominent figures in mathematics         education.  This project has the potential for great  significance,             since it represents a key step in the drive for national acceptance of          calculators in mathematics education. The  Mathematical Association of          America, Texas Instruments, and the two participating school districts          are contributing an amount  equal to 42% of the National Science                Foundation request.",
