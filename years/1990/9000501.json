 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Mario Gerla of the University                 of California at Los Angeles in a research collaboration with                   Professor Luigi Fratta of the Politechnical University,                         Milan, Italy.  The proposers intend to focus on the design of                   high speed networks.  The advances in fiber optics, signal                      processing and switching technologies, the proliferation of                     microcomputers and workstations and the increasing sophistica-                  tion of the end user offer new opportunities for the                            introduction of enhanced communications services to business                    and residences.  The following main directions of research                      are proposed: design and evaluation of Metropolitan Area                        Network (MAN) architectures; performance evaluation and                         topology configuration of Broadband ISDNs; interconnection of                   LANs, MANs and B-ISDNs.                                                                                                                                         Novel metropolitan network architectures based on tree                          topologies and wavelength division multiplexing will be                         investigated, with the goal of achieving much higher speeds                     (in the Gigabit range) than available from existing MAN                         products.  Network control and management techniques for high                   speed, wide area networks will be developed to guarantee                        efficiency and to prevent congestion.",
