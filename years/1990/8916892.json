 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between James Natland of Scripps                Institution, and Fred Frey of MIT.  It is an integrated textural,               mineralogical, and geochemical study of ultramafic xenoliths and                their host lavas from the Samoan, Society, and Marquesas Islands                in the southwest Pacific.  The xenoliths are in existing                        collections, and preliminary mineralogical and isotopic work                    demonstrates that they are related to processed of partial                      melting and magmatic differentiation beneath these volcanoes.                   The island chains contain some of the most enriched basaltic                    lavas in the ocean basins, which are hypothesized to be related                 to a regionally widespread, perhaps hemispheric, geochemical                    anomaly in the mantle.  Xenoliths should provide complementary                  information on the compositions of mantle sources, the action of                metasomatic processes in influencing or modifying source                        compositions, and the processes of melt extraction and magmatic                 differentiation in and near the source regions of ocean-island                  basalts.  Studies so far indicate that both residual (Type 1) and               \"cumulate\" (Type 2) xenoliths are present in all three island                   chains, and that substantial degrees of partial melting produced                possible tholeiitic magmas which crystallized olivine-spinel-                   pyroxene assemblages en route from the mantle.  Such lavas may                  comprise much  of the voluminous, submerged, but still unsamples                portions of these volcanoes                                                     Principal techniques to be applied to the xenoliths will be 1)                  petrography; 2) electron-probe microanalysis of mineral phases;                 3) ion-probe analysis of trace-element abundances in minerals,                  and 4) a combination of mass spectrometry (conventional solid-                  source and ICP-MS), XRF, and instrumental neutron-activation                    analysis for whole-rocks and mineral separates.  Steps 1 and 2                  will be used to select the appropriate range of samples for                     detailed ion-probe, isotope, and trace-element studies.  Bulk                   chemical, trace-element, and isotopic measurements will be made                 on host lavas and these related to temporal successions on the                  islands, which are already known.  Comparisons will also be made                to published information on continental and Hawaiian xenolith                   suites.",
