 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing Research is a very young research area.  In the past few              years it has become clear that computation is joining experimentation           and mathematical analysis, providing a basic new scientific paradigm            for how science gets done.  In such a new and rapidly changing field,           communication among researchers is particularly important.  But the             conference structure in computer science and engineering is highly              fragmented and works against such communication.  Important new                 research results are seldom presented at broad based national                   meetings.  Consequently, broad based meetings are seldom attended by            active researchers.                                                                                                                                             A Federated Computing Research Conference is planned to address this            problem.  This conference will retain the advantages of smaller                 specialized meetings while at the same time facilitating communication          among researchers in different subfields.  Additional benefits of this          meeting include:  (1) economies of scale, (2) providing an educational          function for the public, (3) stimulating new research.  Planning for            this conference will consist of developing discussions and consensus            within the computing research community as well as careful planning of          site selection and other arrangements.  Most of the administrative              effort in this planning will be carried out by a steering committee of          prominent members of the research community.",
