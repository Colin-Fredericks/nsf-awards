 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant renews support for an ambitious and productive project               on economies with uncertainty and with private information.  This               phase of the project studies the presence or absence of insurance,              credit, and risk reduction arrangements in poor high risk                       economies.  It develops and makes tractable economic models with                private information, limited communication, and spatial separation.             It measures which of these impediments are important in practice                and determines what information-communication structures prevail                in poor high risk villages.                                                                                                                                     More specifically, the research contains the following:                         (1)  Empirical tests of full insurance for three villages surveyed              by the International Crops Research for the Semi-Arid Tropics                   (ICRISAT) in India from 1975-1984;                                              (2)  The development of general equilibrium prototypes with                     particular emphasis on private information to explain dispersed                 land holdings, modeled from historical material for medieval                    England, but applicable with modifications to India and Thailand;               and (3)  The evaluation of survey questionnaires administered to                villagers in northern Thailand to quantify which, if any, risk                  reduction arrangements are used and to measure the nature and type              of information impediments.                                                                                                                                     A variety of important policy issues turn on whether or not there               are private information problems or impediments to trade in poor                high risk villages and whether or not risk reduction devices are                available.  For example, rice banks in Thailand are run like                    standard text-book banks, not respecting the erratic nature of crop             yields.  This project should show whether or not rice banks are                 needed and, if needed, how they might be improved.  But the major               contribution of this project is methodological.  Standard economic              theory relies on a paradigm of full insurance and complete markets.             The poor agrarian villages studied in this project are used as                  natural laboratories in which to evaluate full insurance models.                Alternatives to full insurance models exist but they are                        unrealistic or so complex that they can not be estimated                        empirically.  This project for the first time merges three                      different strands of theoretical research with actual applied                   research.",
