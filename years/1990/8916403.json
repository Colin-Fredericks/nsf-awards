 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the mechanism of bacterial resistance                 to defensin peptide antibiotics.  The experimental approach                     includes biochemical studies on the interaction of defensins with               phoP and phoP Salmonella.  PhoP is a genetic regulatory locus                   that controls the expression of genes encoding factors that                     protect Salmonella from the bactericidal action of cationic                     proteins or peptides derived from neutrophils or macrophages.                   The defensins are cationic peptides that have antibacterial                     action.  Transport studies with isotopically-labelled chloride                  are to be conducted with intact cells, membrane vesicle                         preparations and liposomes in order to ascertain what functional                changes accompany the loss of phoP function in the presence and                 absence of defensins.  PhoP-regulated constituents determining                  sensitivity to defensins are being characterized with the aid of                transport assays to determine sensitivity to defensins as a                     prelude to characterizing and purifying these proteins.  The                    project further involves the production and investigation of                    mutants that affect senitivity to defensins.                                                                                                                    Mammals are often able to fight off invading pathogens through                  the production of natural antibiotic agents, and some amphibians                and insects also seem able to do this.  Certain bacteria have                   evolved strategies to survive the antibiotic effects of these                   natural microbicidal agents, but how they do this is not                        currently known.  Dr. Groisman's research provides fundamental                  information that is essential for understanding how bacteria are                affected, or not affected, by antibiotics.  This type of basic                  knowledge provides a foundation that may provide a basis for the                development of improved antibiotics.  This is an important goal                 because bacteria of the genus Salmonella currently cause a                      variety of disease conditions in animals and humans that are                    estimated to cost the U.S. national economy about fifty million                 dollars annually.",
