 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical research on computational group theory will be                carried out by six students in this Research Experiences for                    Undergraduates project.  Students will learn to apply the high                  level programming language CAYLEY in their investigations into                  group structure.  This language is designed around algebraic                    concepts of structure, set and mapping.  It contains an extensive               data base of group theoretic and geometric information.  Students               define structures and then extract information about the                        structure.  For example, a small finitely presented group (of                   order less than 20,000) can be completely analyzed by CAYLEY:                   conjugacy classes, subgroup lattice, normal subgroups and                       automorphism group.                                                                  Work will focus on two areas, typical values and counting in               groups.  The former concept arises in probability when studying                 random samples.  The sample means for subsamples may form groups                with respect to symmetric differences.  If the subsample means,                 or typical values, do form a group, then the intervals formed by                the means contain the true mean with a known probability.  The                  commutativity of group elements. This is a concept not usually                  accessible to researchers using CAYLEY.  Questions such as                      counting the number of group elements which commute and                         calculating the probability that two elements commute will be                   taken up.                                                                            Follow-up will provide encouragement and assistance to help                students with publication and presentation of their results.                    Most will participate in the annual Rose-Hulman Undergraduate                   Mathematics Conference, begun in 1984.//",
