 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support shipboard scientific support equipment                for the research vessel ENDEAVOR, an NSF.owned ship operated by                 University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography and                 dedicated to use in support of ocean science research.                                                                                                          The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Directors, John F. Bash and James J. Griffin are                    fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable                  experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of                    shipboard equipment.                                                                                                                                            This project will allow the institution to replace an old                       andoutdated radio and radar, obtain slip rings for three                        winches,and replace an obsolete computer.",
