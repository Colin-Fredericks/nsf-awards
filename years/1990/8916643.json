 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metalliferous deposits prescipitate along mid-ocean ridges when                 hot hydrothermal fluids contact cold seawater. Three classes of                 models have been developed to explain this process: 1)                          qualitative models describing sulfide chimney formation, based                  on petrologic studies of hot spring deposits at several                         locations; 2) quantitative chemical models, based on what                       isknown of the fluids at 21N on the East Pacific Rise,                          describing fluid/rock interactions but failing to account for                   the changes in these interactions through time; and 3)                          laboratory experiments of sulfide precipaitation, which to date                 have not duplicated truly in situ temperatures and pressures.                   The PIs seek funds to continue Tivey's previous work on a                       transfer-reaction model of chmney growth, and to validate it                    against information obtained at several existing vent sites.                    Her model is unique in its incorporation of both the physical                   aspects of an active chimney (flow rates, fluid temperatures,                   porosity of the chimney walls, cross-sectional area and shape                   of the chimney, etc.) and the chemistry of the fluids and                       precipitates. By allowing each of these parameters to change in                 both time and space, the PIs contend they, more than any other                  modelers, will be able to characterize many features of the                     whole hydrothermal vent system.",
