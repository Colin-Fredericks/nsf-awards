 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a continuing research program it is proposed to develop an                   improved fundamental understanding of the equilibrium and                       dynamic behavior of oil-water-surfactant systems and to assess                  the implications of the results to current challenges in                        detergency.  Phase behavior experiments and observations of                     dynamic behavior using videomicroscopy will be carried out                      with model systems consisting of pure components.  However,                     emphasis shall ultimately be on systems containing mixtures of                  pure surfactant and/or soils since mixtures are the rule in                     practice.  Strong interaction with industrial research groups                   investigates detergency will continue to be a significant part                  of this work.                                                                                                                                                   One major emphasis of the research will be to determine the                     limiting conditions in mixed soil or mixed surfactant systems                   when surfactant-rich intermediate phases just start to form                     upon contact of surfactant solution and soil.  Early results                    suggest that detergency improves significantly when such                        phases occur, whatever the details of the phase behavior.                       Thus, this approach offers the promise of being of general use                  to identify conditions where good detergency can be expected                    for a wide variety of systems of general widespread interest.",
