 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI seeks to investigate culture-based reactions of Native                   Americans to technological innovations.  The argument, well based               on fact, is that Native Americans have not adapted to our highly                technological society as have other citizens of this country.  The              question is, Why not?  The investigator will also examine whether               cultural and social differences among tribes help account for                   differences between them in their success at integrating                        technology into existing ways of life.  Another important question              is why some technologies fit Native American cultures while others              do not.                                                                                                                                                         In this planning grant the investigator will conduct a thorough                 literature review, discuss the proposed research with selected                  Native American community leaders and scientists, and conduct a                 pilot project based on questionaires to test attitudes towards                  technology.",
