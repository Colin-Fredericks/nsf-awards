 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopes and optic illuminators are being purchased for use by               undergraduate students in an archaeology laboratory studying                    microscopic wear patterns on stone artifacts. The objective is to               enable students to discriminate different functional uses of stone              tools based on microwear polish and striations found on artifact                working edges. The acquisition of this equipment upgrades previously            available instruments, and provides students with the means to                  undertake comparative analyses of microscopic wear patterns on                  artifacts used in the same task. The equipment is also used to study            under magnification marks made on bone to differentiate those caused by         natural agencies, such as trampling or gnawing, from those caused by            stone artifacts in the process of butchering. The university will               contribute an amount equal to the award.",
