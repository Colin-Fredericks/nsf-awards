 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this fellowship will be to advance knowledge of                the ecological role of Neotropical Chrysomelidae through field                  studies concentrating on identifying hostplants and on larval                   studies.  This research will be performed in Guanacaste National                Park, Costa Rica, because it has a rich and easily accessible                   fauna and because Costa Rica is an international center for the                 study of tropical biodiversity.  The research will be done in                   cooperation with local scientists at the Costa rican National                   Institute of Biodiversity and made available through the                        Institute to the international scientific community and to Costa                Rican institutions.                                                                  The Chrysomelidae are the second largest family of beetles                 and are particularly diverse in the American tropics.  Almost all               are plant feeders and many are crop pests.   Their role in wild                 tropical ecosystems is largely unstudied and hostplant and life                 history information is available for only a small minority of                   Neotropical species.  By concentrating field work at Guanacaste                 National Park, the PI will be able to take advantage of a large                 body of accumulated botanical and ecological knowledge of the                   Park; at the same time,the diversity of habitats in the park                    will make findings from this project relevant to many other areas               of Central America.",
