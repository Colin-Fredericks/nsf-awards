 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project, Enhanced Macromolecular Chemistry and Engineering                  Undergraduate Education in the 1990's and Beyond, is being held as a            two-week course for thirty undergraduate faculty. The course is                 organized as a joint venture between the American Chemical Society              (ACS), the member Divisions of Polymer Chemistry and Polymeric                  Materials:  Science and Engineering, and the staff of the Education             Division and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.  The          program provides undergraduate educators with an in-depth exposure to           modern theories and experimental techniques of polymer science and              engineering in order that these topics can be incorporated more widely          and deeply into undergraduate chemistry and engineering curricula, in           major universities, small colleges, and among predominantly minority            institutions.  This course is in support of the new ACS Committee on            Professional Training Guidelines for approval of polymer chemistry              programs.  It includes outreach program activities at ACS national and          regional meetings.                                                                                                                                              The American Chemical Society and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute            and State University are contributing and additional 30% of the costs           of the total program.",
