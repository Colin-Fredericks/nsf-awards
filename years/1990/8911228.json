 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the great explosive eruptions of Tambora in Indonesia as                 up to 30 km3 of pyroclastic flows may have entered the ocean                    during the 1815 event. Similarly, pyroclastic or debris flows                   of unknown character formed up to 30 m thick submarine deposits                 up to 15km from the Krakatau volcano in the 1883 event. The                     nature of the interaction between subaerial pyroclastic flows                   and the sea is poorly understood but is critical to competing                   models of volcanogenic tsunami generation and of the formation                  of co-ignimbrite ash. The PIs will study the submarine deposits                 from tambora (1815) and Krakatau (1883) by using a suite of                     existing piston and gravity cores from the Tambora area and by                  collection of new cores from the shallow seas around Krakatau.                  The results of the study will be used to 1) test existing                       models for the generation of tsunamis and co-ignimbrite ash                     fall during the Tambora and Krakatau eruptions, 2) develop                      general models for the interaction of pyroclastic flows and                     seawater, and 3) characterize the nature of subaqueous deposits                 formed by such interactions. These results will be significant                  in terms of understanding the eruptive processes of these                       events and providing modern analogues of volcaniclastic                         sedimentation that can be applied to ancient convergent margin                  sequences in the geologic record. The project is being co-                      funded with National Geographic Society.",
