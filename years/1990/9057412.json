 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of heat transfer in a single blood vessel is well                                                                                                   understood because of its similarity to the case of duct flow.                                                                                                  But the collective effects of the entire vasculature are not                                                                                                    easily modeled.  The primary difficulties arise from the large                                                                                                  number of vessels, their wide range of sizes, their                             complicated, tree-like geometry and the time dependence of the                                                                                                  blood flow due to thermoregulation.  Most existing models are                                                                                                   based on some sort of volume average of the energy equation                     that yields an effective medium theory.  Typically, the blood                                                                                                   is assumed to act as a distributed heat sink or an enhancement                                                                                                  to the thermal conductivity of the tissue.  But there has been                                                                                                  considerable debate over the proper form of such models with                    the earlier work of the author suggesting that no single model                                                                                                  is valid under all circumstances.  In fact, effective medium                    theories may need to be discarded entirely in some cases.                       The aim of this research is to explore new ways of modeling                     heat transfer in tissue.  As one approach to this                               problem, concepts from fractal geometry will be used to                         represent various vascular architectures.  Another approach                     will be based on a recent proof of the author that blood                        vessels often act like conductive fibers.  A new concept of                     bioheat transfer results:  the tissue and vasculature may be                    viewed as a composite of conductive materials.  The                             implications of this model have yet to be fully explored.                       Finally, a control systems approach will be used to                             investigate the role of thermoregulation on tissue-level heat                                                                                                   transfer.  This will extend existing studies of                                 thermoregulation that emphasize the whole body or regional                      response.  An experimental program is also planned to                           supplement the analytical and numerical studies.                                                                                                                The outcome of this research will be immediately valuable to                                                                                                    the designers of clinical equipment.  A reliable underlying                     theory is essential to the intelligent design of heating                        applicators and thermal sensors.  New technologies that                         improve safety and comfort in thermally stressful environments                                                                                                  may also result.",
