 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonsteady state performance of chemical reactors are difficult                  to predict and analyze.  Many industrial reactors exhibit such                  behavior and the result is that the large and unexpected                        swings in performance mandate their operation far from                          productivity maxima. This also has the potential to cause                       serious accidents.  By understanding the mechanisms and                         manifestations of reactor dynamics, existing processes can be                   improved, reactor safety can be increased, and new modes of                     reactor operation may become feasible.                                                                                                                          The PIs plan to focus on the dynamic behavior of a class of                     nonlinear systems:  catalytic reactors.  They are planning a                    program designed to characterize catalytic reactions and                        reactors experimentally and theoretically in order to develop                   a more fundamental understanding of these systems and an                        improved ability to control them.  Experiments will probe the                   dynamics of oscillatory and multiple steady states by                           monitoring spatial and temporal variations of spontaneous                       catalytic oscillators and of systems perturbed between states.                  Systems studied will primarily be fast reactions on noble                       metals where heat effects and nonlinear kinetics combine to                     produce these behaviors.  In particular, the selectivities of                   endothermic decomposition reactions and exothermic oxidation                    reactions on Pt and Rh surfaces in single crystal, wire, foil,                  monolith, and supported forms will be studied.  Models will be                  developed to simulate spatial and temporal dynamics in these                    systems, to determine the types of behavior which may occur,                    and to develop more efficient algorithms to solve nonlinear                     reactor problems.  Effects of strong attractive adsorbate                       interactions, multiple surface phases, and surface diffusion                    limitations on reaction systems will be modelled.  New                          computational methods such as inertial manifold theory will                     also be applied to these problem.  ***//",
