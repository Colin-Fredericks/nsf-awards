 "awd_abstract_narration": "Progress made in the fabrication of high-speed                                  devices and the increasing demand for a higher level                            of integration in digital circuits have led to several                          important changes in the design of networks and                                 computers, and in their interconnections, both on-chip                          and off.  At present, with the faster rise times,                               shorter delays and higher frequencies involved simple                           analysis and straightforward simulation of the                                  networks are involved and no longer possible using                              the old tools.                                                                  It is essential to develop more complex and more                                sophisticated models and analysis tools for simulating                          the interconnecting circuits between components of                              the network.  Computer-aided design (CAD) tools                                 play an essential role in helping this analysis, in both                        the design and the simulation of the interconnects.                             Measurement techniques play an active role in                                   determining the accuracy of the design methods                                  as well as the feasibility of the design considered.                            Laboratory simulations allow a comparison with                                  computer simulations and verification of the accuracy                           of the simulation techniques.  Finally, new                                     interconnect schemes must be devised and analyzed                               to replace older methodologies.  The object of the                              proposed research is to provide a better                                        understanding of the behavior and performance of                                interconnections in microelectronics packaging and                              high-speed digital network applications.  Three                                 important aspects can be distinguished in the study:                            1) development of accurate models and analysis of                               signal propagation in interconnects; 2) experimental                            characterization of interconnections; and 3)                                    implementation of an interconnect-based                                         computer-aided design simulation program.",
