Secondary               objectives include the creation of an electronically acessible                  data-base which can serve a variety of purposes (studies of sound               change in particular daughter languages, statistical studies of                 reconstructed forms, etc.).  Data will be drawn from about 120                  attested languages, all of which have been used by the PI in past               publications.  For reasons of time the project will be largely                  limited to integrating about 220 pages of unpublished pilot study               material with various scattered publications and a critical                     reassessment of the material in Otto Dempwolff, Vergleichende                   Lautlehre des austronesischen Wortschatzes (1938).  The published               result will contain well over twice the number of entries in                    Dempwolff (1938) in an up-to-date orthography, a reverse English-               Austronesian Index, and the following features which are not                    found in Dempwolff: 1. affixed forms, 2. an explicit indication                 of relative time-depth for all etyma, 3. detailed semantic                      reconstructions, 4. annotations to the reconstructions, 5. an                   appendix of submorphemic roots.  It is anticipated that the                     results will be of great and lasting value not only to                          Austronesian specialists, but also to long-range comparativists                 and to social anthropologists and prehistorians interested in                   island Southeast Asia and the Pacific.",
