The structural analysis will be done primarily with a site                 directed photoaffinity agent placed at a series of specific sites               in the 16S rRNA.  Psoralen and UV crosslinking will also be used                to monitor the overall configuration of the 16S rRNA.  These                    experiments will provide new information about the three                        dimensional configuration of the RNA segments close to the                      decoding site at greater resolution than is presently available                 and will also provide a sensitive method to detect structural                   changes.  It is expected that this information will help clarify                the mode of the action of the 30S subunit during tRNA binding and               protein synthesis.",
