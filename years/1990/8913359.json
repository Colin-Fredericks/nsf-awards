 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel of 25 U.S.                           scientists to participate in the 12th conference of the                         International Association of Energy Economics planned to be                     held in New Delhi, India in January 1990.  The themes for the                   conference is Energy, Enviroment and Development.  Typically                    these IAEE conferences draw attendance of 300 of which about                    half are from the Host country.  It is expected that this                       project would support half the U.S. participants, those who do                  not have access to travel funds from other sources.  The                        format and content of the meeting is designed to maximize the                   effective exchange of research results and information.  Most                   of the panels will be devoted to questions of direct interest                   to both U.S. and Indian investigators.  The discussions are                     expected to indentify specific areas for future joint                           research.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  Both India and the U.S. share certain concerns in                       dealing with energy production and utilization including the                    enviromental effects, and the economic impacts.  The oil                        imports are a major part of the foreign trade in the two                        countries.  The impact in India and other developing countries                  of the cost of oil is likely to grow as quantities and prices                   increase.  The rural energy situtation in developing countries                  has hardly been improved by the recent drop in oil prices.                      The conference will benefit participants from developed and                     developing countries by allowing exchange of relevant                           information on problems  and potential solutions that may also                  alleviate the deterioration of the enviroment.  The Indian                      coorganizer Dr. R.K.  Pachauri is the current president of                      IAEE and director of the Tata Energy Research Institute which                   is a relatively young but very active and respected research                    organization.  It is likely that this meeting will produce                      significant results in terms of publications, exchanges of                      information and developments of joint research.",
