 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Martha Rees of Baylor University              in a research collaboration with Professor Ana Paula de Teresa of               the Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana de Iztapalapa, Mexico.                   The investigators intend to address the issue of how do peasant                 households reproduce themselves, not only biologically, but                     economically and socially as well, in the fact of adverse                       conditions posed by the expansion of the market.  Data collected                in the Central Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico will permit a diachronic                and a synchronic analysis of the effect of external factors (e.g.,              market) on internal household structure and organization--the                   reverse of Chayanov's model in which internal needs determine                   peasant production.  Data include genealogies and work and                      reproductive histories to be summed in matrices by chronological                year and household age.  Results will show changes in consumer/                 worker ratio, division of labor, expulsion or retention of                      household members (via marriage or migration), changing productive              and subsistence activities, and demographic behavior.                                                                                                           The collaborators have experience with the field training of                    graduate and undergraduate students in Anthropology. Such training              will be an integral part of this research as much of the data                   collecting and analysis will be performed by graduate and                       undergraduate students in Mexico and the United States.",
