 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a combination of whole watershed discharge                    measurements, observations of nutrient fluxes within riparian                   forests, and landscape modeling to study the effects of                         geochemistry, land use distributions, and weather on watershed                  discharges of nitrogen and phosphorus to Chesapeake Bay.                                                                                                        Comparisons of discharges from watersheds in the three                          geological provinces of the Chesapeake watershed (Appalachian,                  Piedmont, and Coastal Plain) will examine the importance of                     regional geochemistry.  Within each province, a comparison of                   discharges from watersheds with contrasting distribution patterns               of cropland and forest will be made in order to quantify the                    variability of discharges within a province and to test the                     generality of the nutrient-filtering ability of cropside                        riparian forests previously observed on coastal plain watersheds.               Multi-year data would be collected to gain insight into effects                 of weather variation.  Fluxes of nutrients moving through                       cropside riparian forests will be measured and determine the                    spatial pattern of nutrient retention (particularly nitrate)                    within those forests.  The importance of factors such as                        geochemistry, forest age, slope, and forest width will be                       evaluated.                                                                                                                                                      Landscape models of nitrate discharge from cropland/forest                      systems will be developed and used to predict landscape                         discharges by combining data on retention within forests with                   detailed information on the spatial distribution of forest                      relative to cropland, developed with the aid of a computer-based                geographic information system (ARC/INFO).  Model predictions will               be compared with spatial data at different levels of resolution                 in order to evaluate model performance and develop                              recommendations for regional efforts to model discharges to the                 Chesapeake.  The investigators are well qualified to do this type               of research, and the institutional support is excellent.",
