 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in environmental                 engineering between Dr. Joan Rose, University of South Florida                  and Dr. Jeni Colbourne, Thames Water Authority, New River Head                  Laboratories, London, England.  The objectives of the project                   are to develop strategies for assessing the occurence and                       concentrations of enteric protozoa in potable water supplies,                   and then to apply risk assessment models for the development of                 control approaches for water engineers in the US and UK.                                                                                                        Recently, two large waterborne outbreaks of Cryptosporidium have                occured in the US and the UK in water systems which treat the                   water by coagulation, filtration and disinfection in the absence                of any violation of standards.  The proposed research will                      evaluate protozoan contamination (Cryptosporidium in particular)                of the Thames Water Authority's catchment basin, comparing gene                 probe technology to immunofluorescent techniques.  Specifically,                the investigators will:  1) compare gene probes for rapid                       detection of cysts to the immunofluorescent techniques currently                used for water samples collected during a survey of catchment                   basin, 2)  evaluate the capability of the various treatments to                 remove Cryptosporidium  cysts and Giardia cysts, and 3) apply a                 risk assessment model based on cyst concentrations in source                    waters and potential treatment to define the health impact.                     The results of this research will promote communication on a                    common problem facing the water industry, assist in developing                  and standardizing procedures for assessing environmental                        protozoan contamination and define appropriate treatment                        approaches which will help eliminate waterborne                                 Cryptosporidisis.  The project will benefir from the complementary              expertise of the two, investigators:  Dr. Rose has had significant              involvement with surveys for Cryptosporidium and Giardia in                     water, as well as with the development of immunoflourescent                     techniques.  Dr. Colbourne has developed standardized procedures                for parasite recovery and detection.",
