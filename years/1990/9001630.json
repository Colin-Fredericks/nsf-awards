 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first NSF funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates                    (REU) program was in the summer of 1989 at the Center for                       Astrophysics and Space Astronomy (CASA).  The program will                      continue in the summers of 1990 and 1991.  The students,                        half drawn from the University of Colorado (CU) and half                        drawn from other institutions in Colorado or adjacent                           states, will spend ten weeks in a program designed to                           maximize both their educational and research experience.                        Students will be matched with a research project and faculty                    mentor prior to their arrival.  The ten-week program begins                     with an intensive, one-week training period in which                            students are given a thorough overview of the facilities and                    research tools available at CASA, and develop a detailed                        research proposal to serve as a plan of action for the                          remaining nine weeks.  Throughout the ten-week program                          students meet daily in a 3 credit course entitled \"APAS                         4010, Astrophysical Research Seminar\".  The course was                          designed expressly for the purpose of the CASA REU program;                     it presents students with a theoretical framework in                            relevant astrophysical topics, provides a wide survey of the                    astrophysical research at CASA, and offers advice and                           guidance on graduate school or future careers in                                astrophysics.  Students are expected to present both oral                       and written Final Reports on their research at the end of                       the ten-week program.                                                                                                                                           The program anticipates a progressive pattern of student                        activities.  Students begin by participating in our summer                      program, in which they will develop the background and                          skills needed for continued research success.  Following the                    summer program, it is hoped that students will continue with                    independent support to the development of a senior thesis in                    astrophysics, which in turn can lead into a successful                          graduate experience and career.",
