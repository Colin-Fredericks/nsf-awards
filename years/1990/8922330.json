 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several approaches to making automated reasoning systems more                   effective will be investigated.                                                      The Prolog Technology Theorem Prover (PTTP) has been developed as          a logically and search-space complete extension of Prolog with an               exceptionally high inference rate that permits it to solve shallow              theorem-proving problems very rapidly.  The use of PTTP in a                    subordinate role in conventional resolution theorem provers will be             explored.  PTTP can be used to implement the theory resolution or               linked inference principle procedures, fast refutation checks for               newly derived clauses, E-unification, and sort reasoning.                             A Prolog-like abductive reasoning system has been developed in            PTTP and has been used for pragmatic processing of sentences in a               system for text understanding.  More abstract formulations of the               PTTP's abductive reasoning method will be developed and studied with            the objective of improving the performance of the system and enabling           it to make better choices about which abductive explanation is best.                 Ohlbach's approach to modal reasoning is compatible with                   conventional resolution theorem provers, since it transforms modal              formulas to classical formulas with extra world-path arguments that             denote the modal prefix.  Special unification algorithms for world              paths, which depend on the modal accessibility relation, are then               used.  A partial implementation of this approach has been developed             and will be refined and investigated.  The approach promises to                 preserve the investment of developing resolution systems while proving          theorems in modal logic.                                                             A case-splitting rule for resolution will be developed.  For non-          Horn problems with some derived ground literals, it will combine the            generality of the resolution procedure and the case-splitting behavior          and performance of the Davis-Putnam procedure on propositional                  problems.",
