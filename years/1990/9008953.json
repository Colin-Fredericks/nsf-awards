 "awd_abstract_narration": "A procedure will be developed for the analysis of dynamic response              and noise transmission of large structural systems of finite length             which are composed of discretely periodic units.  The method is a               combination of finite elements, transfer matrices and waved                     propagation.  The response is treated as superposition of wave                  motions using wave reflection (due to changes in the construction               pattern) and transmission matrices.  This enables the computations              to proceed in the direction of wave propagation only, so that the               results are always numerically stable.  The new method can treat                long piece-wise periodic stiffened structures of finite length,                 which is not possible with traditional transfer matrices, because               of numerical difficulties.  The method can use the finite element               formulation for the periodic units to treat systems of complicated              geometries and is expected to be much faster than the finite                    elements because the degrees of freedom are reduced.  The method                will be used for the prediction of the structure-borne noise                    transmission of large flexible structures.  Finally, the method                 will be used with the stochastic finite element formulation to                  reduce computational time, which is an evident problems in                      stochastic response as the number of elements increases.                                                                                                         //",
