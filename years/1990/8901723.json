 "awd_abstract_narration": "They have developed a theory for the universal onset of global                  superconductivity in granular superconductors which is in good                  agreement with recent measurements.  Quantitative predictions                   have also been made for the critical current and the kinetic                    inductance in the broken symmetry state.  Theoretical                           investigations of single junctions have ranged from the                         examination of such fundamental issues as the requirements                      imposed by causality and by Anderson`s theorem to the development               of a variational scheme as a practical computational aid.  They                 will continue their work on Josephson phase fluctuations by                     studying the full quantum mechanical implications of the phase-                 dependent quasi-particle capacitance and the influence of thermal               fluctuations, magnetic fields, and disorder on global two-                      dimensional coherence.  Proposed investigations of critical                     phenomena in restricted geometries include that of the Kapitza                  resistance of liquid helium.",
