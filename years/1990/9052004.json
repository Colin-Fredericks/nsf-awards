The project is providing a bridge                between the discipline gaps in biochemistry, organic chemistry                  physical chemistry and polymer chemistry by incorporating a High                Resolution Fourier Transform Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (FT-NMR)                Spectrometer into the Chemistry Department.  FT-NMR is an                       important instrumental technique which is widely used in all                    areas of chemistry, materials science, biology and medicine.                    This instrument is being used routinely for teaching purposes in                sophomore, junior and senior courses, where modern NMR                          experiments can be incorporated into the curricula to educate                   students, develop their powers of critical thinking, and                        encourage them to pursue careers in science.  The instrument is                 also enabling undergraduate student to carry out meaningful                     individual research projects with faculty advisors in each of the               above mentioned areas.  The project is having a major impact on                 the vitality and productivity of the Chemistry Department.                                                                                                      The University is contributing in excess of 300% of the NSF                     funds.",
