 "awd_abstract_narration": "The understanding and meaning of ethical judgements are of                 greatest importance to all citizens.  Questions of particular                   interest to the scientific community, however are whether there                 is a relation between ethics and evolution and whether a system                 of evolutionary ethics is a legitimate subject of analysis.                          These questions, initiated by Herber Spencer's work in the                 1870's, have been answered in the past either in the positive, or               vehemently opposed.  Evolutionary ethics blossomed as Social                    Darwinism in the later part of the nineteenth and the beginnings                of the twentieth centuries.  Now, probably strengthened by                      sociobiology and the associated controversies, there is a renewed               interest in, and a reexamination of, the possibilities of                       evolutionary ethics.  Presently a rigorous (and emotional)                      rethinking of evolutionary ethics cuts across political and                     feminist positions.  On the one hand there exists an                            evolutionary, conservative political view based on evolutionary                 biology which lends itself to support the conservative views of                 sociobiology, and on the other hand sociologists and even                       communists have claimed an evolutionary moral ground.                                The symposium will analyze the position taken on                           evolutionary ethics, point out the difficulties with all                        interpretations, and argue for and against the legitimacy of                    ethical analysis of evolutionary ethics.",
