 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the development of a standardized workstation             to assist students in the electrical engineering laboratories.  Each            workstation is centered around the NeXT computer coupled with                   automated test equipment and permits the students to make                       computations (numerical models), perform automated electrical                   measurements, acquire data, perform simulation and test designs from            one integrated workstation.  By unifying all of the above activities            via one standard computer interface (taught early in the junior                 year), the student is able to concentrate on the engineering concepts           being taught throughout the rest of the laboratory courses.                     Workstation development concentrates on three specific applications.            Two areas deal with continuous and discrete signals and systems and             makes use of the GPIB equipment and storage oscilloscope and spectrum           analyzer software.  Theoretical and simulation results are easily               compared and contrasted with experimental measurements.  The third              area deals with development of innovative computer-mentored                     experimentation with microprocessor systems using logic analyzers.              These applications are intended to demonstrate the effectiveness of             the integrated workstation approach and lay a foundation for further            work. The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                    principal investigator's institution.",
