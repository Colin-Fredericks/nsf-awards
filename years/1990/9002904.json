 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project will concentrate on problems arising in               the analysis of algebras generated by holomorphic or harmonic                   functions (function algebras).  A metric is used to measure the                 distance between any two functions consisting of the maximum of                 the function value differences, often referred to as the uniform                norm.  The underlying theme of the work concerns algebras of                    functions which lie between familiar algebras.  On a compact set                in the plane one considers the effect of adjoining a function to                a given function algebra (of holomorphic functions) and then                    completing the new collection into a larger algebra.  A                         fundamental question is whether or not the new algebra consists                 of all continuous functions if the additional function was                      harmonic.  This is resolved in a recent work if the harmonic                    function is real-valued.  A clarification of the situation when                 it is complex-valued remains to be done.                                             Some progress has also been made in the setting of several                 complex variables, where the same basic questions can be raised.                At the present time, the domains are restricted to balls and the                functions adjoined to the ball algebra of continuous holomorphic                functions must have continuous first derivatives.  A second goal                of this work will be to relax the differentiability condition                   which appears to be unnecessary.",
