 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design is a knowledge-intensive and experience-intensive task.                  For the most part designers create new designs by adapting a                    combining previous designs.  While much research in the past few                years has gone into investigating the processes involved in                     routine design, almost none has addressed issues related to                     creative or non-routine design.  We propose to investigate the                  processes involved in creative design and to build experimental                 systems that do creative design in the domains of meal planning,                architecture (office design), and mechanical design.  This                      investigation will capitalize on previous work in design, and                   will look at the ways in which routine problem solving processes                can be used or extended to create novel solutions to problems.                  It will also extend previous work on case-based reasoning,                      looking at how previous cases can be used in novel ways.  The                   work will concentrate in four areas:  design specification                      restructuring, exploration of design alternatives, merging of                   several design alternatives, and non-routine adaptation.  The                   first two are necessary for what engineers call conceptual                      design, a design stage in which the design specification itself                 is defined.  The last two look at the ways fixes or patches to                  partial designs can be done in novel ways.  An understanding of                 design processes will enable the creation of the right kinds of                 design tools to help designers with their tasks and will help to                build the kinds of tools and to develop the kinds of curricula                  that can best be used to train designers of the future.",
