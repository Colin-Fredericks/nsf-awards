 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many countries have experienced difficulties managing commodity                 export booms and fail to follow a savings path that is consistent               with the life cycle-permanent income hypothesis.  Having                        estimated the size of the booms and busts and then using these                  estimates to test the life cycle hypothesis for Botswana and                    Kenya, it appears that Botswana saves boom income, which is                     consistent with the life-cycle hypothesis, while Kenya does not.                Among the questions suggested by these findings are: (1) Is there               a precautionary demand for savings in Botswana, and can the                     findings for Botswana be explained by a precautionary demand for                savings?  (2) Can the results for Kenya be explained by liquidity               constraints or by myopic behavior?  The purpose of this research                is to provide answers to these questions.  Models will be refined               and tested empirically in order to address these issues.  The                   research is important because it will provide a clearer                         understanding of why countries respond to boom times the way they               do and how public policy might mitigate the effects of commodity                induced booms and busts in developing countries.",
