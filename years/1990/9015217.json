 "awd_abstract_narration": "The floating-zone process is an important method for growing                    single crystals of electronic, optical and high-Tc oxide                        superconducting materials.  The shape of the melt/gas                           interface, i.e., the free surface of the melt zone, can                         significantly affect zone stability, which is critical to the                   successful operation of the process.  The shape of the                          melt/crystal interface, as well as the solute and temperature                   distributions in the growing crystal, can significantly affect                  the crystal quality.  These interface shapes and distributions                  are governed by transport processes such as heat transfer,                      mass transfer and fluid flow during crystal growth.  In this                    project, analysis of the interfacial stability problem will be                  undertaken simultaneously with the study of heat and mass                       transport during crystal growth.  It is expected that this                      integrated approach will contribute to the manufacture of                       larger single crystals and of purer and larger samples in zone                  refining.                                                                                                                                                       The research consists of three parts:  1. crystal growth and                    zone-stability improvement,  2. flow observation and                            segregation analysis, and  3. computer simulation.  The study                   is unique in that the interaction between convection in the                     melt zone and the shapes of the melt/solid interfaces will be                   clearly demonstrated through direct observations of a                           transparent melt zone during actual crystal simulation.",
