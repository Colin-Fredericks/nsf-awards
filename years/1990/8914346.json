 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even though theoreticians agree that supernova explosions derive                their energy from the collapse of the progenitor star's core, they              have found it very difficult to confirm this theory numerically.                Recently, J. Wilson has succeeded in modelling SN ejection by the               \"delayed supernova explosion mechanism.\"  According to this                     mechanism, energy from the progenitor star's core collapse is                   transferred to the envelope by neutrinos in a delayed fashion.                                                                                                  The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate the                     viability and necessary conditions of Wilson's mechanism.  The PI               will use a one-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic computer                   code, originally developed by Myra et al.                                                                                                                       The PI's specific focus will be on how the explosion, the                       resulting neutron star, and the neutrino emission spectrum are                  dependent upon the progenitor star's mass and structure.                        Furthermore, he will calculate theoretical neutrino burst                       signatures, simulate the star's mantle convection two-                          dimensionally, and investigate the evolution of X-ray and gamma-                ray emissions.  The 2-D code has been developed, debugged, and                  tested by Fryxell.                                                                                                                                              As a final topic, unrelated to SN, the PI proposes to continue                  with his evolutionary calculations of brown dwarfs and very low                 mass stars.",
