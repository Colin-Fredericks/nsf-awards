 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program addresses a ground                                        failure phenomenon known as liquefaction that                                   can result when certain soil deposits, such                                     as loose saturated sands, are subjected to                                      the strong ground motions induced by                                            earthquakes.  Structures built in or on                                         ground that liquefies are very prone to                                         failure.                                                                                                                                                        Most of the laboratory research on                                              liquefaction has involved experiments on                                        saturated clean sands, whereas most of the                                      natural deposits susceptible to liquefaction                                    range from silty sands to sandy silts.  There                                   is, therefore, a need to address in the                                         controlled environment of the laboratory the                                    more difficult problem of the liquefaction of                                   silty soils.                                                                                                                                                    The objective of this research program is to                                    understand the liquefaction characteristics                                     of silty soils.  One of the main goals is to                                    establish threshold limits for the                                              liquefaction potential of silty soils in                                        terms or grain size and soil plasticity: the                                    motivation is to improve the understanding of                                   the liquefaction characteristics of these                                       soils, as well as their use in remedial                                         measures to improve the resistance to                                           liquefaction at a particular site.  The post-                                   cyclic (that is, post-earthquake) behavior is                                   also being investigated: it determines the                                      ability of the soil deposit to function                                         satisfactorily as a foundation material after                                   the ground shaking and resulting liquefaction                                   has subsided.                                                                                                                                                   The results obtained from this research                                         project will provide the basis for a                                            reasonable estimate of the dynamic stability                                    of a wider range of naturally occurring soil                                    deposits.  The post-cyclic studies should                                       provide insights into the phenomenon of                                         delayed failure and permanent deformations of                                   soil deposits subjected to earthquake                                           shaking.",
