Dr. Blasius's project is to complete the construction of               Galois representations for Maass forms of Galois type by                        extending to coherent cohomology certain methods of interpre-                   tation that have been established for holomorphic forms; to                     stabilize the Trace Formula for GSp(4), beginning with the                      Fundamental Lemma; and to study certain lifting problems                        involving Abelian varieties, in the setting of Shimura varieties,               applying his work on p-adic properties of Hodge classes.                             Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
