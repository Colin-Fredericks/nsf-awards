The research projects include: (1) Microwave Acoustic             Materials and Devices; (2) Robotics and Computer Vision; (3)                    Semiconductor Material and Device Property Measurements; (4) Motion             Control; (5) Application Specific Computer Architectures; (6)                   Environmental Radio Noise Measurements; and (7) VLSI-Based Neuron               Models.                                                                         At least six students will come from institutions where research                opportunities are limited and at least three students will be women,            handicapped or minorities.  Students chosen for the program will have           displayed a high degree of initiative and independence of thought in            both laboratories and coursework.  Student research projects are                chosen to match the student's interest and educational level.  In               addition to extensive facilities, students will also have access to             facilities at various nearby industries such as Bangor Hydroelectric            and Central Maine Power Companies, James River, Champion and Scott              Paper Companies, Digital Equipment Corporation and National                     Semiconductor.  At the Program culmination a written report and an              oral seminar are expected from the student.  Three academic credits             are awarded to the student upon satisfactory completion of the                  program.",
