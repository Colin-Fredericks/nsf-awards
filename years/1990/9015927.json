 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the basic purposes of the ERC program is to improve the             education of engineering undergraduate and graduate students.                   Because of the improved educational environment and opportunities               offered by the ERC, its graduates should be better engineering                  problem solvers and well versed in the systems aspect of                        engineering practice.                                                                                                                                           The proposed research would lay the foundation for evaluating the               success of the ERCs in training engineers.  The project would                   define outcome criteria and establish statistically valid sampling              procedures.  The focus would be on Industry's satisfaction with ERC             graduates as employees.  This preliminary study would include a                 pilot survey to test the methods developed and to lay a baseline                for continuing evaluation of the educational effectiveness of the               ERC concept.                                                                                                                                                    The subject population of this pilot study would be 90 industry                 supervisors of ERC graduates and 90 supervisors of similar                      graduates from a non-ERC university that is comparable to the ERC               school.  A conference/workshop, including selected ERC and industry             representatives, would reach a consensus regarding the                          definition(s) of educational success as related to ERC graduates                and to refine the outcome statements.  The pilot study would focus              on the graduates of two of the ERCs that were established prior to              1987.                                                                                                                                                           The report would be distributed to NSF staff, ERC Directors, and                the ECD Advisory Committee.  The results will be useful to NSF in               monitoring the ERCs and to the ERCs themselves to improve their                 educational programs.",
