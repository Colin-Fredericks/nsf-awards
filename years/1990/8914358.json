 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protein phosphorylation in bacteria has only recently been                      demonstrated.  The first report was in E. coli, where an NADP-                  specific isocitrate dehydrogenase was identified as a substrate                 for the protein kinase.  More recently, the phosphorylation of                  isocitrate lyase and enolase in E. coli has been reported.  This                project supports research to:  1) further characterize the                      phosphorylated forms of isocitrate lyase and enolase; 2) further                purify and characterize protein kinases and phosphatases                        catlyzing the reversible phosphorylation of these two enzymes; 3)               elucidate the regulation of cellular metabolism as it is affected               by the post-translational modification of these two enzymes; 4)                 determine the factors which regulate the synthesis and expression               of these activities; 5) investigate the unique regulation of                    isocitrate dehydrogenase activity in Acinetobacter calcoaceticus;               and 6) investigate the role of prokaryotic protein kinases and                  other endogenous proteins in the regulation of eukaryotic                       metabolism.                                                                                                                                                     The reversible phosphorylation of regulatory enzymes and proteins               is known to be an important mechanism for the metabolic control                 of a wide variety of cellular functions in many higher organisms,               and in some viruses.  Only recently has protein phosphorylation                 been demonstrated to occur in bacteria.  It is now generally                    accepted that protein phosphorylation represents an important                   regulatory mechanism for a variety of physiological processes in                many species of microorganisms.  This research will examine the                 phosphorylation of bacterial enzymes, providing a better                        understanding of how bacterial metabolism is controlled.  It will               also provide insight into how this phosphorylation system                       interacts with that of higher organisms, and whether this might                 have any relationship to the process of infection.",
