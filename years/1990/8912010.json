 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two techniques used to study the gravity signature of                  slow-spreading give conflicting results. The admittance                         function technique compares observed spectra of gravity and                     topography with the sprecta predicted from isostatic models.                    This technique suggests that the topography at slow spreading                   ridges is supported by an elastic plate 8-10 km thick. When                     gravity and topography profiles are stacked, however, the                       admittance values increase apparently due to noise and                          structural variations. The residual gravity technique                           incrementally strips the observed gravity anomaly of its                        components calculated from simple assumptions of crust and                      mantle structure; the result is impterpreted in terms of                        deviations from the assumptions. This method fails to predict                   observed thinning of the crust near fracture zones suggesting                   that the method is not sensitive to crustal structure.                               The principal investigator will determine the limitations                  of the two techniques and effects of along axis structural                      variability and the dimensionality of the topography on the                     results. Both techniques will then be applies to a dense                        bathymetric and gravity data set between 45 and 47 N on the                     Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The following questions will be addressed                   in this analysis. (1) What is the crustal structure of the                      axial rift valley of a slow spreading ridge? (2) Is this                        crustal structure supported locally, regionally, or                             dynamically? (3) Are the along axis variations in axial                         morophology reflected in changes in the crustal structure and                   isostatic state?",
