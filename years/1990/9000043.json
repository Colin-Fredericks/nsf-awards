 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Chisholm will investigate fundamental aspects of                       growth regulation and dynamics of marine plankton in the                        fluctuating environments that are typical of oceanic regimes.                   This understanding is essential for modelling and designing                     studies of marine productivity and food web dynamics.                           Specifically, they will:                                                                                                                                        *    Study the diatom life cycle, to better understand what                          environmental and genetic factors control the switch from                       vegetative to sexual reproduction;                                                                                                                         *    Investigate the cell cycle in cyanobacteria and marine                          bacteria, to better understand how their DNA cycle is                           regulated under changing growth conditions, and why aspects                     of the cycle deviate from the classic E. coli model;                                                                                                       *    Develop a multichannel, high-sensitivity (and relatively                        inexpensive) flow cytometer, which will facilitate the study                    small picoplankton and marine bacteria.                                                                                                                         The results of this work will augment our understanding of                 microbial growth rates in the sea and phytoplankton population                  genetics; it should also contribute methodological advances for                 the study of marine bacteria at sea.  Moreover, it could enhance                our fundamental understanding of microbial physiology by                        revealing features of marine organisms which deviate from                       classical paradigms.",
