 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test the idea that a distinctive fauna of               ancient, endemic, specialized invertebrates lives in the                        groundwaters of unglaciated Mesozoic terrain in eastern North                   America.  The existence of such a fauna is to be expected based                 on the distribution of the faunas of caves and surface waters in                eastern North America.  This idea will be tested by analyzing the               invertebrate communities of shallow groundwater (the hyporheic                  zone) at 15-20 sites between the Canadian border and the Gulf of                Mexico.  The results of this research will help to answer                       questions about several important topics, including:  (i) the                   zoogeography and evolution of the groundwater fauna; (ii) the                   ecological structure and function of groundwater communities of                 different evolutionary ages;  (iii) interactions between epigean                generalists and hypogean specialists in groundwater communities;                (iv) predicting the response of groundwater communities to global               climate change; (v) predicting the response of groundwater                      communities to catastrophic disturbance; and (vi) elucidating the               evolutionary and physiological ecology of groundwater                           invertebrates.  The project will contribute to the basic ecology                of groundwater communities, an area of major interest among                     ecologists, and will add to the knowledge base useful for applied               science.",
