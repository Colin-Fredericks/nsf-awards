Underlying this research is the general question of how the past                wavefront set of a solution of a differential equation influences               the wavefront set in the future.                                                     In the first project, work will be done investigating the                  propagation of conormal singularities of solutions to the Cauchy                problem for second order strictly hyperbolic equations in three                 space dimensions. The initial data is assumed to be conormal to                 the smooth part of a characteristic hypersurface with a                         swallowtail singularity. One object of this study will be to                    show that there is at most a cone of anomalous singularities                    propagating from the swallowtail point.                                              In the second project, the propagation of conormal                         singularities for semilinear hyperbolic mixed problems with                     Dirichlet conditions on domains with diffractive boundaries will                be considered. Here, the object will be to show that there is at                most a cone of anomalous singularities propagating from the                     glancing points.",
