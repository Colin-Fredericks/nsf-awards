 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scott V. Edwards, working under Allan C. Wilson in the                     Department of Biochemistry and James L. Patton in the Museum of                 Vertebrate Zoology, Department of Integrative Biology, will                     employ new molecular techniques to study patterns and causes of                 geographic variation in a social songbird.  The species to be                   studied, the Grey-crowned Babbler (Pomatostomus temporalis), is                 found throughout the northern portions of Australia and in                      southern New Guinea.  It is well known for its conspicuous social               system called \"cooperative breeding\" in which several, often                    related, individuals forsake breeding on their own to assist the                main breeding pair in building nests, guarding territories and                  raising young.  Evolutionary biologists have been intrigued by                  such systems because they may result in genetic differences                     between local populations due to inbreeding within populations;                 on the other hand, geographic differences among populations may                 be due more to extrinsic factors such as topographic or                         environmental barriers that serve to isolate populations from one               another.  Each scenario predicts different patterns of genetic                  diversity and relatedness at the family-group, population, and                  regional levels.                                                                     The recently devised polymerase chain reaction (PCR)                       provides a method whereby high resolution genetic data can be                   obtained simply and rapidly from large numbers of individuals of                a species.  Edwards will collect blood samples from babbler                     populations throughout its range with the goal of obtaining                     adequate numbers of individuals within families, populations, and               biogeographic regions.  The genetic research will focus on an                   extremely variable region of a maternally inherited molecule                    found in the mitochondria of all higher organisms--mitochondrial                DNA.  The PCR when applied to this region will highlight the                    genetic differences among individuals within an among family                    groups as well as geographic populations, and will provide a                    means whereby the contribution of social and/or historical                      factors determine genetic structure in the Grey-crowned Babbler.",
