 "awd_abstract_narration": "Commercial exploitation over the past two hundred years drove                   the great Mysticete whales to near extinction.  Variation in                    the sizes of populations prior to exploitation, minimal                         population size during exploitation and current population                      sizes permit analyses of the effects of differing levels of                     exploitation on species with different biogeographical                          distributions and life-history characteristics.  Dr. Stephen                    Palumbi at the University of Hawaii will study the genetic                      population structure of three whale species in this context,                    the Humpback Whale, the Gray Whale and the Bowhead Whale.  The                  effect of demographic history will be determined by comparing                   the genetic structure of the three species.  Additional studies                 will be carried out on the Humpback Whale.  The humpback has a                  world-wide distribution, but the Atlantic and Pacific                           populations of the northern hemisphere appear to be discrete                    populations, as is the population of the southern hemispheric                   oceans.  Each of these oceanic populations may be further                       subdivided into smaller isolates, each with its own migratory                   pattern and somewhat distinct gene pool.  This study will                       provide information on the level of genetic isolation among                     populations and the levels of gene flow and genealogical                        relationships among populations.  This detailed genetic                         information will facilitate international policy decisions                      regarding the conservation and management of these magnificent                  mammals.",
