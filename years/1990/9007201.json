 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physical                      chemistry between Dr. Glenn Evans, Oregon State University                      and two British scientists:  Dr. Paul Madden, Oxford University                 and Dr. Michael Allen, University of Bristol.                                                                                                                   Dr. Evans will carry out research in two closely related                        areas involving the theory of structural and dynamic properties                 of molecular liquids.  Molecules in a liquid phase undergo                      extremely frequent encounters and collision induced phenomena                   arise directly as a consequence of these encounters.  In the                    first part of this collaborative study, Dr. Evans and Dr.                       Madden will address what type of molecular information is                       learned from the study of collision induced depolarized light                   scattering, vibrational energy transfer and infrared spectra.                   The second part of the collaborative study with Dr. Allen                       will deal with the way in which we envision the collisions to                   take place in liquids comprised of nonspherical molecules.                      The investigators will examine the question of whether the                      collisions are correlated or uncorrelated.  That is, does a                     specific pair of molecules undergo frequent recollisions or                     does this pair once having collided never recollide?  The                       answer to and the consequences of this question, which is                       also reflected in collision induced scattering, will be                         determined by the analysis of liquid properties, such as the                    viscosity, thermal conductivity, and rates of molecular                         rotation and translation.  Analytical theory and computer                       simulation, together with experimental data, will be employed                   to interpret the findings.  The project will benefit from the                   complementary expertise of the three investigators.  Dr.                        Evans is one of a few world class theoreticians in the                          statistical mechanical treatment of fluids.  Dr. Madden is an                   international leader in the interpretation of collision                         induced phenomena.  Dr. Allen is an acknowledged expert in the                  simulation of properties of fluids of nonspherical bodies.",
