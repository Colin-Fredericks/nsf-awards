 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interrelationships among politics, ideology, and the economics         of industrial organization have direct relevance to focal issues in             industrial geography:  the spatial location of industrial enterprise,           the constraints on decision making imposed by various ownership                 patterns, and decisions about the introduction of new technology.               Within the country of Israel, a remarkable diversity of production              structures coexists.  Production structures are characterized by the            way in which the labor process is organized and by the distinct                 political and ideological structures that regulate the production               process.  This doctoral dissertation project will apply recent                  theoretical insights in the field of industrial geography to                    compare the organization of production and the location of industry in          four distinct production structures--the kibbutz, Histadrut (labor              federation), government, and private industry.  This research will              relate the industrial restructuring taking place at the level of the            firm in Israel to the distinct economic, political, and ideological             characteristics of each production structure and to the economic,               political, and ideological restructuring taking place at the national           level.  The doctoral student will conduct twenty firm-level analyses,           five for each production structure, and the validity of the findings            from the individual firm-level analyses will be tested and compared to          empirical findings of the contribution of each production structure to          the Israeli economy in general over the last thirty years.                                                                                                           This project will contribute to our understanding of the extent to         which organization and location of industry in these production                 structures is constrained and motivated by political and ideological            elements in the use of space, labor supply and demand, the application          of technology, organizational structure, and the availability of                capital.  It will expand our understanding of location theory as it             applies to capitalist economic development, and it will add the                 dimension of space to the study of industrial restructuring.  The               project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising              young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
