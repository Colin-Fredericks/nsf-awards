 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with a selection of theoretical and                     numerical aspects for certain classes of parabolic partial                      differential equations.  Determination of surface temperature and               heat flux from a finite set of interior temperature                             measurements, stable under noisy data will be investigated.                     Theoretical and numerical analysis of methods involving                         eigenfunction expansions of initial data and Whittaker Cardinal                 expansions of initial and boundary data will be studied.  In this               part of the work, the investigator will employ more standard                    regularization techniques for recovering the Fourier coefficients               of initial data.  However, the stability of the numerical                       inversion based on Whittaker Cardinal expansions is novel.  In                  this approach, the problem of choosing a regularizing parameter                 as in standard  approaches no longer exists.  However, the                      \"regularizing\" necessary for this method takes the form of an                   appropriate choice of the number of spatial sensors and the                     sampling time, both of  which have been completely determined in                recent work for special cases.  A further regularization is                     obtained by a suitable apriori restriction of the class of                      initial data appropriate to Sinc Expansions.",
