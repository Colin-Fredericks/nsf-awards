 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Douglas Price, Mr. Joseph Ezzo will                  conduct doctoral dissertation research.  He will carry out                      chemical analysis on the approximately 270 human skeletons from                 the archaeological site of Grasshopper Pueblo, located in                       Arizona.  He will reconstruct changes in the inhabitant's diet                  over time.  To do this he will determine concentrations of trace                elements such as strontium and calcium which reflect the relative               amount of meat consumed.  Analysis of carbon isotopic ratios will               provide insight into the importance of plants such as maize in                  the diet.                                                                                                                                                       The Grasshopper site is important for several reasons.  First                   occupied ca. A.D. 1295, it grew into a major prehistoric                        settlement but was suddenly abandoned about A.D. 1400.  This same               trend in mirrored in other sites in the region, and it is unclear               to archaeologists what underlying process is responsible.  Mr.                  Ezzo postulates that examining change in diet may shed light on                 this issue, because non-chemical analyses of human skeletal                     material suggest that subsistence related stresses may have grown               severe as population density increased.  Chemical analysis                      provides a new and complimentary approach to this question.                     Because Grasshopper is one of the best-known sites in North                     America - research has been conducted there for 27 consecutive                  field seasons - the comparative data base is excellent.                                                                                                         Several benefits will result from this research.  New light will                be shed on a major prehistoric site, and our understanding of the               mechanisms which govern the growth and decline of technologically               simple populations will be increased.  The project will also                    provide a test of the utility of such chemical based approaches                 and, finally, will assist in the training of a promising young                  scientist.",
