 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the general area of main-group                          chemistry and in the specific area of boron hydride chemistry.                  Boron-hydrogen compounds are of considerable practical interest                 as starting materials for the synthesis of new materials or for                 improved syntheses of known materials, such as metal borides.                                                                                                   The goal of this project is to develop new synthetic strategies                 to facilitate high yield selective transformations in boron                     hydride chemistry. Of especial interest is the use of                           transition metals to catalyze transformations of polyhedral                     boranes and carboranes. The use of ruthenium carbonyl compounds                 to catalyze the insertion of alkynes into polyhedral carboranes                 will be investigated. Metal-catalyzed alkyne and olefin                         addition and coupling reactions will be used for the synthesis                  of alkenyl- and alkyl-boranes. Late transition elements will be                 investigated as catalysts for isomerizations of carborane                       cages. Transition metals, particularly Pt(II), will be                          investigated also as catalysts for dehydro-coupling,                            -condensation, -cyclization and -cage growth reactions of                       boranes. In a second major sub-project the syntheses and                        chemical and structural properties of hybrid polyhedral                         boranes, such as hypho-dithiaborane clusters,  will be                          investigated.",
