 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is a renewal award for DMR-8521834, which was                   highly productive: development of new analytical techniques to                  study the fundamental phase transformations and chemical                        reactions between two different oxide ceramics at near atomic                   resolution, development of the use of Rutherford backscattering                 spectroscopy to determine the kinetics of reactions in these                    systems, and confirmation that topotaxial and epitaxial growth in               these materials occurs in layers of several unit cells at a time                rather than one atomic layer at a time, as previously believed.                 The emphasis of this work is to use these new analytical                        techniques to understand the effect of the structure and                        chemistry at the phase boundary upon the movement of the                        interface between two oxides of different crystal structure.                    Analytical techniques being used include:  all aspects of                       transmission electron microscopy will be used (e.g., chemical                   analysis, atomic lattice imaging. converging beam electron                      diffraction), electron microprobe, visible light microscopy,                    Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction.                  Materials if interest include:  nickel-aluminum oxide spinels,                  magnesium-aluminum oxide spinels, magnesium-chromium-aluminum                   oxide speinels, and iron-aluminum oxide spinels.  The research                  has two main objectives:  geometry of the interface, and to                     understand how the morphology and the chemistry of the interface                affect the kinetics with which the interface develops.",
