 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demonstration of a major advance from a Labradorean dispersal               center flowing essentially at right angles to regional topographic              features, and that overtopped Loks Land despite an unconstrained                margin facing the open ocean to the SE, provides strong evidence                that the flux of ice during this advance must have been great.  The             cross-sectional area for that portion of the ice facing the                     Labrador Sea is ca. 300 km2.  Assuming a velocity between that of               Jacobshavn Glacier, an outlet glacier draining the Greenland Ice                Sheet (8 km a-1), and the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica (1 km a-1)                 yields an annual flux of 300 to 2400 km3 a-1.  This is about the same           fresh-water flux entering the North Atlantic when the St Lawrence               outlet was opened by the retreating Laurentide Ice Sheet 11,000                 years ago (30,000 m3 sec-1 or 1000 km3 a-1; Teller, 1988).                      Recognizing the importance of ice-sheet/ocean interactions in the               global climate system, we are proposing a research campaign to                  include a new field effort to define more precisely the spatial                 limits of this newly recognized advance, and the timing of its                  onset and retreat, and to model the ice dynamics based on the field             evidence.  Specifically, we intend to address five objectives:  1)              Defining the maximum limits of the Labradorean advance; 2)                      Deciphering the interaction between the Foxe outlet glacier the                 flowed out Frobisher Bay and the Labradorean ice sheet backfilling              the bay; 3) Determining whether all of Meta Incognita Peninsula was             over-ridden by Labradorean ice; 4) Defining the temporal limits of              these advances; and using the field evidence on the limits and                  timing of ice sheet advance and retreat as input to glaciological               models to provide realistic ice limits, and ice velocities.                     Accurate reconstructions of the overall configuration of the                    Laurentide Ice Sheet and the pattern of its flow are necessary to               understand the climate and general circulation during a glaciation,             the response of the earth's crust to loading, and contribute to our             understanding of ice dynamics.",
