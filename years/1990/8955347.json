 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Educational Research Association (AERA) is                    conducting a research and training program with joint support                   from the National Science Foundation and the National Center                    for Education Statistics. The purpose of the program is to                      foster policy and practice relevant research in the general                     area of math and science education using the rich data bases                    available at NCES.                                                                                                                                                   The Program has four components: (1) a fellows program;                    (2) a small grants competition to stimulate policy and                          practice relevant research using NCES math and science data                     sets; (3) a series of training opportunities for educational                    researchers in the use of NCES data sets, especially those                      related to math and science; and (4) an internship program in                   NCES for advanced graduate students. The fellows program will                   facilitate collaboration and consultation among academic                        scholars and NCES scientists in their endeavors to improve                      the quality of education indicators. The small grants                           competition, the training program, and the graduate                             internships will foster more systemic and sustained analyses                    of math and science education data and also help build the                      educational research infrastructure and increase the number                     of scholars conducting policy and practice-related research                     with NCES' data sets.                                                                                                                                                The training program, the fellows program, the graduate                    internship program, and the small grants competition will be                    administered  by AERA and guided by an Advisory Board                           composed of prominent scholars.",
