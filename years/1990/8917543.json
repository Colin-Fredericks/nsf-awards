 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Paul Dagdigian and Prof. Millard Alexander (U. of                         Maryland) are supported by a grant from The Experimental                        Physical Chemistry Program to study electrical and rotational                   inelastic collisions in diatomic molecules. These measurements                  will allow us to obtain valuable insight into the fundamental                   processes that govern chemical reactions in very simple systems                 that model the difficult problems found in more complex                         molecules.                                                                                                                                                      The grant contains components from both experiment (Dagdigian)                  and theory (Alexander) for such molecular entities as CN, OH,                   NH and the very difficult H + C2 reactive system. The                           experimental component will involve the measurement of                          state-resolved inelastic cross sections both in crossed                         molecular beam and in optical-optical double resonance (OODR)                   studies using a discharge-flow system. In the former,                           collsional excitation of cold free radical beams will be                        investigated. The theoretical component will involve both the                   ab initio determination of accurate potential energy surfaces                   for the ground and low-lying electronically excited states of                   three and four atom systems as well as quantum scattering                       studies based on these potential surfaces. Particular attention                 will be devoted to the determination of the crucial                             non-adiabatic coupling matrix elements.",
