 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory is being established for advanced cognitive                        modeling.  In recent years, large-scale computer models have                    revolutionized the techniques of theory construction in cognitive               science.  The undergraduate who has been exposed only to                        traditional qualitative conceptual models and tractable                         mathematical or formal models can no longer be said to know how                 contemporary research in cognitive science is done.  Computer                   modeling has been greatly accelerated by the introduction of                    powerful computer workstations and associated software.  The new                laboratory has a network of four workstations that have enough                  computing power and memory capacity to handle both large scale                  symbolic models, such as rule-based problem solving models and                  natural language processing models, and large-scale connectionist               or neural network models for cognitive processes, such as word                  recognition and low-level vision.  The laboratory is stocked with               a number of running models and tools for model development, which               are employed in two advanced courses on cognitive modeling, and                 intermediate course in experimental cognitive psychology, and in                undergraduate thesis projects.  The models are also used for                    demonstrations throughout the cognitive science curriculum.  The                college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
