 "awd_abstract_narration": "The treatment of satellite fields-of-view in the                           International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) permits               only two descriptive categories: either free of or contaminated                 by clouds.  For the cloud-contaminated cases, a single-layer                    \"effective\" cloud model is then used to derive the radiative                    properties of the cloud, which is presumed to be spatially                      homogeneous plane-parallel with fixed scattering properties.  An                ability to distinguish either broken or uniform clouds has                      profound consequences for computing radiative fluxes at the                     surface and top of the atmosphere.  The \"spatial coherence                      method\" (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) is designed to address                   this problem by taking advantage of the \"structure\" amongst the                 pixels to retrieve percentage cloud cover.                                           Using the 4 km AVHRR data, Dr. Coakley will derive empirical               estimates of cloud cover and radiative properties for the Pacific               and Atlantic Ocean basins from 50 degrees South to 50 degrees                   North.  He will determine the effect of cloud geometry on its                   reflectivity, and assess the opacity of clouds at IR wavelengths                and possible bias of the spatial coherence method.  Dr. Coakley                 will also collaborate with ISCCP scientists to compare and                      contrast the results from two different approaches.",
