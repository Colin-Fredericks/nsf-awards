 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this US-Czechoslovak cooperative research              project between Dr. Irving Epstein of Brandeis University and                   Dr. Milos Marek of the Prague Institute of Chemical Technology is to            examine basic qualities of inorganic chemical and biochemical                   systems consisting of units that can display oscillatory or                     excitable behavior.  When coupled together, these units may exhibit             unusual and important properties such as growth or cessation of                 oscillatory behavior or chaotic phenomena.  Both theorectical and               experimental studies will be undertaken.  Results should provide                insight into the new phenomena that can arise when nonlinear                    reaction dynamics are coupled with concentration gradients and the              effects of diffusion.  Knowledge of this phenomenon of excitability             and its influences may lead to an ability to predict the behavior               of a periodically forced oscillator or pair of coupled oscillators              which would be of considerable interest to chemists and biologists              studying coupled dynamical systems.                                                                                                                             This project in inorganic and bioinorganic chemistry fulfills the               program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                 leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine              complementary talents and pool research resources in areas of                   strong mutual interest and competence.",
