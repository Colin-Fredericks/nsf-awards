 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study seeks to increase the fundamental                            understanding of the local effects of shear and                                 turbulence on cell growth and productivity.  The                                experimental technique will involve measurement of fluid                        velocity, shear stress, and turbulent intensity in                              standard Bellco bioreactors with a Laser-Dappler                                Anemometry (LDA) system.  Velocity and turbulence                               mappings as a function of vessel height and radial                              distance will be determined over a wide range of                                operating conditions and vessel sizes.  LDA measurements                        will be done in reactors containing a medium analogue                           fluid that simulates the fluid environment of cultured                          cells.  Effects of hydrodynamic forces on the cells will                        be evaluated using standard cell loading, cell growth                           rate, oxygen uptake and product concentration                                   measurements.  Data collected will then be used to                              develop a quantitiative model correlating hydrodynamic                          properties with cell growth, metabolism and                                     productivity.  LDA measurements, as proposed in this                            study, are thought to allow for more accurate                                   correlations to be made in bioreactors where a high                             degree of non- uniform turbulence occurs.",
