 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in high energy                   theoretical physics between Dr. John Ralston, University of                     Kansas, and Dr. Bernard Pire, Center for Theoretical Physics,                   Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France.                                                                                                                         The investigators, who have a long history of fruitful collabora-               tion, propose a new area for applying the fundamental theory of                 strong interaction physics, Quantum Chromodynamics, to high energy              collisions with nuclei.  The goal of such research is to learn                  from the comparison of theory with experiment, as well as to make               theoretical predictions and suggestions for future experiments.                 Their method will extend their work on the phenomenon called color              transparency, where they showed that Quantum Chromodynamics may in              some cases be more cleanly tested and applied in a nuclear medium               than with isolated particles.  A parallel project involves the                  possible phases of nuclear matter in QCD.  The investigators will               propose a percolation-theoretic viewpoint, arguing that a color-                conducting, but chirally-broken phase may have been observed in                 recent relativistic heavy-ion experiments.                                                                                                                      These studies in theoretical physics will benefit from the                      complementary expertise of the two investigators and should make a              continuing contribution to this important field of research.",
