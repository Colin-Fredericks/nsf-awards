 "awd_abstract_narration": "When computers are used as a tool in teaching, rather than as the               major object of instruction, their use should be driven by the                  specific pedagogical aims of the course, and should require very                little instructional overhead.  This is not the case for many of                the software systems available for use in introductory computer                 science and mathematics courses.  \"Principles of Computer Science,\"             a course taught on a limited basis for the first time in the Fall               of 1989, is designed to teach some of the foundational ideas of                 computer science at an introductory level.  It does not teach                   computer programming or computer literacy.  An important part of                this course is a series of microcomputer experiments that are                   designed to illustrate principles being taught in the course while              requiring no class time for instruction on the programs used in the             laboratory.  Twenty one IBM microcomputers are necessary for the                full implementation of this project.  Future efforts will expand                and refine the scope of the material coverage.  The award is being              matched by an equal amount from the principal investigator's                    institution.",
