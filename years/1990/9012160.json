 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alice Walters, doctoral student: Dissertation, \"Tools of                        Enlightenment:  Scientific Texts and Instruments and the                        Dissemination of Ideas in Eighteenth-Century Britain.\"                          During the 18th century, scientific books and instruments--                     tangible objects designed to communicate knowledge about the                    natural world--acted both as media and merchandise, and did                     so in remarkably similar ways.  Ms. Walters, working under the                  direction of Professor John Heilbron, is exploiting this fact                   in her dissertation research which seeks to elucidate the role                  of both in the dissemination of ideas in 18th century Britain.                  Ms. Walters distinguishes four functions of books and                           instruments as media, defined as measuring, modeling,                           magnifying, and manufacturing, which correspond to four                         different conceptions of mankind's ability to act on nature.                    Special emphasis is placed on the active functions,                             magnification and manufacture.  As commodities, books and                       instruments were produced, advertised, sold, and consumed,                      frequently by the same individuals for the same reasons.                        These market activities are examined, with particular                           attention focused on the many individuals with professional                     or commercial interests in both books and instruments.                          Finally, the conceptual and commercial functions of books and                   instruments are tied together through consideration of the                      impact of the various commercial activities on the ideas                        communicated by these objects and their presentation.",
