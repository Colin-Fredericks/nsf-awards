 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twenty videotaped instructional units, each about fifteen minutes, with         accompanying print materials will be designed and produced to introduce         general middle and secondary school students to important topics in             statistics and probability.  These video units will draw on footage from        the new television series \"Against All Odds:  Inside Statistics.\"               Students will profit from viewing instruction that makes use of specific        applications shot on location.  The many and varied applications will           demonstrate the wide usefulness of statistics and probability.  The             animated computer graphics will capture student attention and convey            concepts in a manner hard to duplicate in the classroom.                                                                                                        COMAP will distribute the package at cost to insure widespread                  distribution.  Both Woodrow Wilson and Quantitative Literacy workshops          have agreed to pilot materials under development and to use final               materials to assist in dissemination.",
