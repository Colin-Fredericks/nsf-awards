 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to enhance the introductory biology labs              at Texas A&M University by upgrading laboratory instrumentation,                so students can use state-of-the-art equipment to design and                    perform their own experiments in both formal and less structured                laboratory exercises.  Biotechnology is being incorporated into the             laboratory curriculum to complement lecture topics in molecular                 biology.  The purchased equipment is necessary for students to have             hands-on experience with electrophoresis and restriction enzyme                 analysis -- two techniques widely used by researchers in molecular              biology.  Computers will be purchased to interface with laboratory              equipment so that students can design and perform experiments with              more costly equipment.  Students will use these in conjunction with             existing equipment to design their own experiments, analyzing data              and write a report.  Because of the versatility and affordability               of the new teaching technology students can be involved directly                in data acquisition and analysis and rely less on demonstrations.               The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
