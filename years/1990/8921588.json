 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under its previous NSF grant,  the National Center for Health              Statistics (NCHS) expanded its Questionaire Design Research Laboratory          and associated activities into  a national laboratory and program of            research on cognition and survey measurement.  These developmental              efforts were conducted in close collaboration with university                   scientists working both at their home facilities and on-site at NCHS.           In addition to its central leadership role,  NCHS will prepare in the           next two years to assume fiscal responsibility for the entire project.          NSF,  which in turn will be phasing out its support,  will direct its           funding primarily to the Visiting Scientist Program.  The contributions         which the latter already has made to the advancement of survey                  research,  augurs well for its continuing influence as the project              enters its post-developmental stage.",
