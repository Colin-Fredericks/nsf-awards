 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Benfer and                 his colleagues conducted multi-year excavations at the site of                  Paloma, located on the desert coastal plain of Peru.  The site                  dates from the pre-ceramic period and documents the emergence of                the earliest sedentary communities in this region of the world.                 The inhabitants, although they relied on hunted and gathered                    foods, were able to develop a secure enough subsistence base to                 maintain what appear to be permanent settlements.  In the course                of excavation, Dr. Benfer and colleagues opened large areas and                 uncovered both full storage pits and house remains.  These proved               extremely rich in both floral and faunal materials.  They also                  uncovered large numbers of well preserved - often mummified -                   burials.  Because of the extreme desertic conditions which                      resulted in this excellent preservation, the Paloma site provides               unique insight not only into the subsistence adaptations of the                 inhabitants but also into their biological response.  Through                   excavation at other sites, the team has also been able to set                   Paloma into a broader geographic and chronological context.                                                                                                     Dr. Benfer will now conduct analyses and limited fieldwork to                   allow final publication of the results.  A brief field season                   will permit additional - and necessary - stratigraphic                          correlation.  Faunal and floral samples will be analyzed and                    radiocarbon dates obtained.                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  It will allow                  the final and definitive publication of an extremely important                  archaeological site.  It will provide insight into the process                  which led to the sedentization of previously mobile hunting and                 gathering groups and, thus, shed light on the process which led                 to the development of complex societies.  Finally, because of                   graduate student involvement, it will assist in the training of a               young scientist.",
