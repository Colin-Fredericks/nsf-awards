 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical work into qualitative                  and quantitative properties of special functions.  Although any                 class of functions can be termed special, those of interest are                 those that appear as the solutions of certain important problems.               They arise as solutions of differential equations, matrix                       elements of representations of quantum groups, tools in the                     analysis of birth and death processes and as basic ingredients in               approximation theory.  Special functions have different forms.                  Among the earliest studied are those represented by series:                     polynomials for finite series and hypergeometric functions                      occurring as infinite series.  Perhaps the most outstanding                     mathematical question of the day concerns the location of the                   roots of a particular special function, the Riemann zeta                        function.  In addition, the work of one of the world's most                     remarkable mathematicians, Srinivasa Ramanujan, centered almost                 exclusively on special functions.                                                    Work will be done combining advanced techniques of computer                graphics with past work on hypergeometric functions to seek out                 new and unexpected properties which have been missed.  Some                     progress has been made in this direction through the observation                that the maximum modulus of Legendre polynomials increases with                 the degree of the polynomial.  Further work will concentrate on                 monotonicity properties of special functions as the degree or                   other parameters change.  These properties suggest other                        applications such as area under curves and behavior of roots.                   One result of this type contributed the key to resolving the                    famous Bieberbach conjecture several years ago.",
