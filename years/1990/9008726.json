 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable Dr. Philip D. Laird of the NASA Ames                     Research Center to conduct collaborative research for six months                with Dr. Taisuke Sato of the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL)                  Tsukuba, Japan.  They will conduct research in the area of machine              learning.  In artificial intelligence applications, analytical                  learning algorithms are meant to find ways to avoid unproductive                steps by assessing the performance of a machine program as it                   runs.  This project will experimentally evaluate problem-specific               analytical learning algorithms.  Techniques for implementing the                analytical learning component will be explored.  A model for                    designing the utility component of the learning element, so that                the changes proposed by the analytical learning algorithms can be               evaluated and intergrated into the program, will be developed.                                                                                                  Research in the area of analytical learning remains largely                     theoretical.  Dr. Sato's research group at ETL, working on logical              inference and knowledge representation and acquisition, will be                 able to provide effective testbeds for concepts developed by the                P.I.",
