 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research is planned to make new advances in                                     mm-and sub-mm wave sources, as well as their                                    applications.  This work will be based on prior                                 experience in developing mm-wave Free                                           Electron Laser devices at reduced beam voltages                                 (both high power 0.5-1.0 MV FEL oscillators                                     and 50 kV harmonic \"ubitron\" amplifiers).  The                                  new directions, however, will emphasize studies                                 of compact, \"low\" voltage (< 100 kV), and                                       moderate power (0.1-100 kW) devices to be                                       compatible with commercially practical civilian                                 and government applications.  To accomplish                                     new developments in this field, research                                        innovations in electron beam generation and                                     focusing techniques, small-scale radiation cavities                             and periodic structures, and nonlinear efficiency                               enhancement and mode control techniques will                                    be carried out.  Also research on compact                                       periodic structures as an opportunity to research,                              develop, and perform (scaled) testing of new                                    insertion devices for high energy electron                                      storage rings will be performed.  Such insertion                                devices should extend the capabilities of U.S.                                  storage ring facilities as high brightness IR,                                  VUV, and x-ray light source facilities for                                      spectroscopic, materials science, lithographic,                                 and biomedical applications.  Finally, in addition                              to the ceramic sintering process, there are                                     several new applications for moderate power                                     mm-wave sources such as, mm-wave heating of                                     a compact, high density, mirror plasma to                                       efficiently generate soft x-rays for lithography                                and materials processing applications.  Another                                 interest is to study the use of mm-waves for                                    improved thermal processing of dielectric                                       coatings.  A third area of interest would be the                                previously mentioned use of coherent sub-mm                                     sources, (i.e., wavelengths between 0.01-1.0 mm)                                for spectroscopy of various chemical chain                                      reactions and solid-state semi-conductor                                        phenomena.",
