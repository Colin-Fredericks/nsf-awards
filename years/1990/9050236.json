The 3,500-square-foot exhibition will provide                  a broad public with accurate, balanced scientific information                   about global warming and insight into its economic and social                   context.  In so doing, it will help to spark interest in                        science and mathematics among the many young museum visitors                    who are concerned about the future of our environment.                                                                                                               Approximately 2,000,000 citizens will visit the exhibition                 during its two-year tour of 11 U.S. science museums.  Workshops                 conducted at each site before the exhibition arrives and                        educational materials to supplement program planning will                       assist host museums in broadening the exhibition's impact.                                                                                                           ASTC and the Franklin Institute have a history of highly                   successful collaborative traveling exhibition projects.  We                     will be assisted by a group of eminent advisors, a leading                      developer of hands-on science exhibits, and the Museum's                        experienced team of exhibit evaluators.  The exhibition may                     serve as a model for other museums that are now developing                      permanent exhibitions about environmental issues and other                      topic issues in science.",
