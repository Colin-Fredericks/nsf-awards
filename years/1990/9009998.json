 "awd_abstract_narration": "In some flow regimes, the Navier-Stokes equations yield poor                    approximations to the physics of gas dynamics.  For example,                    plasma dynamic flows, low-density flows, flows with large                       Knudsen numbers, or within a few mean free paths of a surface.                  Basically when the flows involve thermodynamic or chemical                      nonequilibrium, one must often resort to the kinetic theory of                  gases.  The governing equation for monatomic molecules and binary               collisions is the Boltzmann equation.  The Boltzmann equation is                at least an order of magnitude more difficult to solve than the                 full Navier-Stokes equations and has eluded most attempts to                    numerically solve it.  When one also considers chemical (in                     addition to translational) nonequilibrium, the problem becomes                  almost completely intractable.                                                                                                                                  The most effective algorithm for solving nonequilibrium gas                     dynamics is the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DMSC) method (1).                However, this algorithm uses a number of phenomenological models                that must be developed further and carefully compared to                        experiment.  This research project will investigate how the DMSC                algorithm can be improved and mapped onto a massively parallel                  computer (the Connection Machine).  Since the algorithm is very                 difficult to vectorize, it operates very inefficiently on most                  traditional supercomputers.  Consequently it is usually run on                  minicomputers for extended periods of time (up to weeks for a                   single problem).  However, portions of the method are highly                    suited to massively parallel computers due to its                               nearest-neighbor characteristics.  In particular, SIMD machines                 such as the Connection nachine are highly suited to these                       problems.",
