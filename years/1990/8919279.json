 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is in the area of organometallic chemistry                    and is concerned with how transition metal oxo complexes are                    formed and how they react. Metal oxides and oxo compounds are                   widely used as catalysts and as reagents for selective                          transformations of organic compounds, but little is known about                 the mechanisms of most of these important processes.                                                                                                            A major focus of the project is the interconversion of alkoxide                 and oxo-alkyl complexes. This 1,2-migration will be explored in                 a number of systems in order to understand the magnitude and                    origin of the kinetic barriers and to determine the migratory                   aptitudes of hydride, alkyl, phenyl, allyl and other groups. In                 a second subproject studies of oxygen atom transfer will probe                  the wide range of stability and reactivity of metal-oxygen                      multiple bonds. Oxygen atom transfer reactions will be used to                  address how multiple bond strengths vary with the nature of                     the metal, its oxidation state, and the ancillary ligands. This                 thermodynamic understanding of oxygen atom transfer will be                     coupled with mechanistic studies, with an emphasis on                           understanding the (often sizeable) kinetic barriers to atom                     transfer. Also to be explored is how oxo complexes are formed                   from dioxygen and related molecules, with special emphasis on                   the possibility of four-electron oxidative addition reactions.",
