 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the genetic architecture of                the MSP (major sperm protein) gene family in Caenorhabditis                     elegans and related nematodes.  Gene families appear to be                      adaptive solutions to the demand that cells produce certain kinds               of proteins in great abundance, and the MSP gene complex is a                   paradigm for this evolutionary mode.  MSP in C. elegans is coded                by 40-50 genes that occur in four clusters on two chromosomes.                  Genes within clusters are more similar in sequence than are genes               residing in different clusters.  Hypothetical mechanisms for the                evolution of gene families include the \"radiation\" of duplicate                 genes within a cluster from an ancestral gene (in which case                    similarity is by descent) and gene conversion in which sequence                 information is homogenized within a cluster by unequal crossing                 over or some comparable mechanism.                                                    The investigator will test these and other hypotheses by                  comparing the architecture of the MSP complex between various                   strains of C. elegans and other species in the same genus.  The                 mechanisms of gene family evolution are formulated in terms of                  population genetics but the comparative methodology, to include                 stimating phylogenies for gene families, draws heavily on the                   principles of systematic biology, whereas a major goal is to                    understand the structure of this important class of eukaryotic                  genes; thus, this research is truly interdisciplinary.",
