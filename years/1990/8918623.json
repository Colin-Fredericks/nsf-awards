 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Pople is supported by a grant from The                           Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 research in the application of molecular orbital theory to a                    wide range of chemically important problems.  The molecular                     orbital theory, as implemented through Pople's series of                        Gaussian computer programs, has had a very significant impact                   on all ares of research in the field of Chemistry, and has                      contributed to the fact that Pople is one of the most widely                    cited scientists in the world today.                                                                                                                            Pople plans to continue his algorithm development and research                  in the following three areas: 1) the development of additional                  new approximations to deal with the electron correlation                        problem which are aimed at providing more accurate descriptions                 of energies, potential surfaces and other physical properties                   of molecules; 2) the improvement of computational efficiency of                 the well-established Hartree-Fock and Moller-Plesset theories                   with particular attention being paid to opportunities raised by                 recent developments in computer hardware; and 3) the                            application of molecular orbital theory to problems of current                  chemical interest where traditional experimental approaches are                 difficult to apply.",
