 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phloem is the conducting system for distribution of photosynthetic              assimilates in vascular plants and also a pathway by which systemic             viral infection can be spread.  The movement of solutes out of phloem           conducting cells is a crucial regulation point for the distribution of          phloem-mobile substances in the plant.  Little is known, however, about         the mechanisms or controls involved.  An experimental approach to               understanding these mechanisms would be to introduce labelled compounds         that have a range of solute sizes and chemical structures into the              phloem and follow the movement of these compounds.  However, this has           been precluded because the phloem cells are pressurized and present             means of introducing material into the phloem also produces significant         artifacts.                                                                                                                                                      An aphid naturally removes sugars from phloem by selectively inserting          a stylet into the conducting cell.  The exploratory work proposed here          would attempt to overcome the problem of introduced artifacts by                developing a method for solute injection directly into the phloem               conducting cells via severed aphid stylets, an approach suggested by            earlier measurements of turgor pressure in phloem conducting cells.             An injection system will be constructed that will utilize thermal               expansion to generate pressure.  Precise pressure control in this               injection system should be possible with a precisely-regulated                  thermoelectric device that has a pressure transducer incorporated into          the injector.  Development of this system should allow injection of             tracer material into phloem cells by a slight and precisely controlled          over pressurization.",
