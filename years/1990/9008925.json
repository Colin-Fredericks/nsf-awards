 "awd_abstract_narration": "Objectives:  This project allows Dr. Sethu Raman of the                         Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, North Carolina                    State University, Raleigh, and Dr. M.P. Singh, Center of                        Atmospheric Sciences, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi,                India, to continue collaboration in the study of numerical                      weather prediction and air pollution.  Work will continue on 1.                 development of a regional weather prediction model to predict                   short range monsoon events, 2. storm surge prediction, 3. monsoon               boundary layer processes and 4. air pollution.  Emphasis in this                research will be on atomospheric turbulence and diffusion.                      Improved parameterization schemes for boundary layer physics and                cumulus heating will be incorporated into the regional scale                    model along with a dynamics initialization scheme.                                                                                                              Scope:  The two teams have been collaborating in the field of                   numerical weather prediction for several years with considerable                benefit to both countries and with significant publications                     published in international journals.  The two scientists have                   strong backing in India for conducting experiments and obtaining                important data that may not be readily available otherwise, thus                the research is likely to be of benefit to the scientists in the                U.S.                                                                                                                                                            Funding:  This project is being supported under two grants:                                                                                                      1.
