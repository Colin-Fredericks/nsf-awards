 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Herpetology Collection (amphibians and reptiles) of the                Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences is a mid-sized                         collection (roughly 30,000 specimens) that contains many types                  and early collections from the New World.  Dr. John Cadle,                      Curator in charge of the collection, proposes to improve the                    collection through a general inventory, reorganization, updating                of identifications, and implementation of a computer database.                  The database program chosen for this project, MUSE, is in wide                  use in other herpetology and fish collections.                                       The proposed collection upgrade and computerization project                will have substantial impact both within and beyond the                         herpetology research community.  Important primary type specimens               will be located and made accessible for systematic research.                    Early collections will give ecologists and biogeographers                       invaluable insight into the effects that several centuries of                   human occupation have had on the region's biodiversity.  The                    renovated collections will be a long-term asset in research,                    public education, and the professional development of young                     herpetologists.",
