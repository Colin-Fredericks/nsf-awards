 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introduction to Molecular Biology is being offered to 24 faculty                members to improve the level of undergraduate molecular biology                 instruction.  Participants receive up-to-date information, hands-on             training in scientific methods, continued support to facilitate the             incorporation of information into undergraduate courses and an                  opportunity to conduct research.  The discipline of molecular biology           is at the forefront of medical research, in agricultural production and         in solving criminal investigations.  However, undergraduate faculty at          community colleges are unable to disseminate the most current                   information and laboratory techniques to their students because they            have had little direct discipline renewal, and cannot keep abreast with         the rapid advances in this vital field.  An intensive one-week                  lecture/laboratory course in molecular biology is addressing this               problem with on-site follow-up support at targeted institutions and             opportunities for research internships.  The project is being                   evaluated through a combination of pre- and post tests, participant             surveys and reports provided for on-site visits and internships.",
