 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work attempts to understand conduction, aging, degradation, and            breakdown mechanisms in high field stressed gaseous, liquid, and solid          dielectrics using new modern optical, electronic, and computer                  instrumentation to see charge transport effects inside materials that           could not be seen before.  Insulating dielectrics used in power                 apparatus, such as transformers and cables, and in pulse power                  technology, such as Marx generators and pulse forming lines, have               their performance affected by injected space charge.  The space charge          distorts the electric field distribution and introduces the charge              migration time between electrodes as an additional time constant over           the usual dielectric relaxation and fluid transport times.  Charge              injection from high voltage stressed electrodes is measured by Kerr             electro-optic field and charge mapping measurements.  Such optical              measurements have been performed for highly purified water,                     water/ethylene glycol mixtures, transformer oil, silicon oil, liquid            and gaseous SF6, liquid nitrogen, and high voltage stressed and                 electron beam irradiated polymethylmethacrylate.  In highly purified            water, Kerr electro-optic measurements, voltage-current terminal                measurements, and electrical breakdown tests have shown that the                magnitude and polarity of injected charge and the electrical breakdown          strength depend strongly on electrode material combinations and                 voltage polarity.  Particular tasks are:  (1) Kerr effect measurements          including low-voltage prestressing of dielectrics; (2) electron beam            irradiation of solids; (3) fractal mathematical modeling of electrical          breakdown trees; and (4) electrokinetic pumping using traveling wave            high voltages.",
