 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite more than a decade of research into parallel computing                  systems, the development of such systems remains a difficult and                error-prone undertaking, owing to the subtle interactions in which              simultaneously executing components may engage.  One way to ensure              that such systems behave correctly is to verify them formally; this,            however, can be an extremely complex task, and even the development of          automated tools has not permitted very large systems to be proved               correct.  Using the framework of process algebra, the broad goal of             this project is to develop automated techniques that enable the                 verification of large concurrent systems.  The project will work along          three lines.                                                                                                                                                      Methodologies will be developed that exploit the structure of                   concurrent systems and their specifications to reduce the                       verification process to a collection of more manageable subproblems             that may be solved using existing techniques.                                                                                                                   Automated tools that support these methodologies will be built on               top of an existing tool, the Concurrency Workbench, which provides              the basic support needed for the proposed techniques.                                                                                                           The utility of the methodologies and associated tools will be                   evaluated by applying them to the verification of existing \"real                world\" communications protocols.",
