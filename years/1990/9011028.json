 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular genetic analyses of mutations in retinal development in               Drosophila have led to the discovery of many important genes                    controlling neural development and interactions.  The principal                 investigator will use this paradigm to isolate genes important in               the development of the sensory innervation of Drosophila wing.                  The research will lead to genes that control aspects of                         development that are not operative during retinal development,                  e.g., guidance of axons over long distances.  A behavioral assay                has been developed that will quickly detect mutations in sensory                innvervation.  Mutant lines will be obtained primarily from a                   large scale P-element insertion mutagenesis carried out in the                  laboratory of Dr. Allan Spradling.  The insects carry a reporter                gene (bacterial B-galactosidase) that provides an immediate                     picture of the distribution of putative gene activity.  These                   constructs greatly facilitate the subsequent cloning of genes of                major interest.  A number of the wing's mechanoreceptors are                    characterized at the single cell level, and much is known about                 their normal development.  Thus, the system is advantageous for                 the kind of developmental genetic approach that has been so                     fruitful in the case of the Drosophila eye.",
