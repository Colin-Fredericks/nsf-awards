 "awd_abstract_narration": "Improving Physical Science Instruction in the Elementary Classroom is           the theme of this conference organized by the Division of Chemical              Education of the American Chemical Society, through its committee of            Pre-High School science and by the American Association of Physics              Teachers.  The conference will take a critical look at the physical             science content and activities presently used at the elementary level.          The conference's two-part design will allow participants to review the          key aspects of learning theory as it applies to the teaching of                 scientific concepts at the elementary levels, formulate an effective            model for obtaining physical science content and activities currently in        use, reviewing these materials, and formulating directions for future           development.  Participants have been chosen based on their knowledge of         physical science education at the elementary level. The conference will         consist of a one-day pre-conference meeting, in January, l990; a four-          day session in May, l990; and a three-day session in February, l991.  To        achieve the specific conference goals and objectives, conference                participants will be organized into Task Groups that will work                  independently between the conferences.  When these task groups have             finished their work and have coordinated their individual reports with          the work of the larger group, the conference will issue a conference            report which will include: the original goals and objectives,                   procedures, findings and recommendations.  At a time when so many school        districts are considering changing their elementary science curriculum          it is critical for them to have this type of advice from the scientific         community.                                                                                                                                                      The cost sharing for the conference will be three hundred percent of the        National Science Foundation portion.",
