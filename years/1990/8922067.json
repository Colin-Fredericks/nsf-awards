 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and                             Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Harry B.                  Gray of California Institute of Technology will conduct                         systematic studies on long-range electron transfer between an                   iridium core and pyridinium acceptors connected to the core by                  rigid spacers.  The spacers will be built from both saturated                   and unsaturated carbon units.  The work is expected to yield                    fundamental information that will be helpful in developing                      molecular approaches to solar energy conversion and information                 storage.                                                                                                                                                        Extensive measurements of electron transfer rates through                       various rigid spacers will enable the relationships                             betweenelectronic coupling and spacer length and electronic                     structure to be determined.  The iridium core consists of an                    Iridium (I) dimer, which serves as the electron donor.  The                     acceptors are N-alkylpyridinium groups bound to phosphinite                     ligands in the molecule selected for study.  The iridium atoms                  are bridged by 3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl and are also bound to                      carbonyl ligands.  This molecule contains a pronounced inverted                 region so that singlet and triplet metal to ligand electron                     transfer and thermal ligand to metal back transfer can be                       investigated.  The results will be of interest to chemists in a                 variety of fields, including spectroscopy, surface catalysis,                   and chacterization of metalloproteins.",
