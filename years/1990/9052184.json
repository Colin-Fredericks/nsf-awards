 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benedictine College is introducing a series of new laboratories in              optics which allow students to study the nature of light with                   equipment similar to what they will find in industry and research.              While investigating such standard optical phenomena as diffraction,             blackbody radiation, and image formation they are learning both the             physics behind several types of detectors (photomultiplier tubes,               photodiode arrays, CCDs), lasers, and fiber optics, and they are                becoming familiar with tools that they are likely to encounter in               graduate school or in industry.  Experiments using these                        instruments are being introduced into the Optics Laboratory course,             which is required of all physics and astronomy majors.  The Optics              lecture course, taken simultaneously, is being changed to include               extensive discussion of these objects and their underlying physics.             Some of the equipment is also being used in upper-division                      astronomy laboratory exercises.  All this equipment is being used               by physics, astronomy, and biology students in undergraduate                    research projects.  Such research efforts are graduation                        requirements for majors in these three areas, and these detectors               are in almost continual demand.  The college is matching the award              with an equal amount of funds.//",
