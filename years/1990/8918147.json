 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to elucidate mechanisms that               regulate genetic expression at the levels of transcription, RNA                 processing, RNA turnover and translation.  Attention is focused on              the mouse genes encoding ribosomal structural proteins (rp's) and               immunoglobulins (ig's).  For the rp genes, we are (i) analyzing                 their distinctive equipotent promoters, (ii) studying the                       importance of introns for stabilization and intracellular transport             of mRNA, and (iii) studying the translational control of rp mRNA.               Future studies of these genes will include a characterization of                rp transcription factors and the genes encoding them, elucidation               of the roles of the oligopyrimidine cap sequence and the internal               promoter elements, studies of the interactions between the various              promoter elements, an analysis of the intranuclear turnover of                  intronless transcripts, and definition of the structural features               that limit the capacity of rp mRNAs to bind ribosomes.  For the ig              genes, we are (i) studying the regulation of heavy chain mRNA                   production by alternative RNA processing, (ii) characterzing the                interplay between elements of kappa gene promoters, and (iii)                   defining the role of the kappa enhancer and chromatin restructuring             in the developmental regulation of kappa gene expression.  Future               studies of these genes will include a comparison of overall                     cleavage-polyadenylation and splicing efficiencies in early and                 late stage lymphocytes, a search for the parameters that determine              the relative efficiencies of JH-Cmu and JH-Cdelta splicing,                     characterization of a novel kappa promoter element and its protein              ligand, cloning of the gene encoding this ligand, and localization              of the genetic segment that confers enchancer-independent                       expression of the kappa gene.  The results of these studies should              not only increase knowledge of how rp and ig genes work, but should             also reveal general principles that apply to other genes with                   similar properties.                                                                                                                                             The experiments performed will continue to follow the processes                 needed to get a gene expressed as a functional protein.  These                  processes are fundamental for most organisms.  The results will aid             in our understanding of gene expression and be applicable to a wide             range of biological problems.",
