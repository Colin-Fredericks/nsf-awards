 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Willard W.                           Harrison, Department of Chemistry, University of Florida,                       and Dr. Tong Soo Loong, Department of Chemistry, University                     of Malaya, to pursue, for a period of 24 months,                                cooperative research on the elemental analysis of                               geological materials by glow discharge methods.  They will                      study the glow discharge as an atomization, excitation, and                     ionization source for the elemental analysis of solids by                       mass spectroscopy and atomic emission.  The research will                       center on the examination of geological materials by                            compacting them with a variety of host matrices.  They will                     study sample preparation procedures and the effect of                           getter agents as matrix and plasma modifiers to scavenge                        reactive gases.  Comparisons will be made of spectral                           interferences, and alternative discharge gases will be                          compared to determine any resultant advantages to their use                     in glow discharge sources.                                                                                                                                      Several important analytical techniques can advantageously                      utilize the characteristics of a glow discharge.  Solid                         samples can be handled directly without the need for sample                     dissolution.  The glow discharge, in general, is a simple                       two-electrode device, filled with a rare gas, usually                           argon, at low pressure.  The sample to be analyzed forms                        the cathode.  When an electric current is passed through                        the device, argon ions are formed, impact upon the sample,                      and sputter atoms into the plasma.  Collision processes                         subsequently excite and ionize fractions of the sputtered                       neutral atoms.  The ionized matter may then be studied by                       various spectrometric techniques.  In their research, the                       collaborators will address several problems encountered in                      using the glow discharge to analyze geological samples.                         The collaborators are highly respected scientists whose                         past association has been productive.  This project is                          relevant to the objectives of the Science in Developing                         Countries Program which seeks to increase the level of                          cooperation between U.S. scientists and engineers and their                     counterparts in developing countries through the exchange                       of scientific information, ideas, skills, and techniques                        and through collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
