 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Objectivity\" has surely always been the goal of scientific                     research.  Yet recent history, philosophy, and sociology of science             studies challenge the very foundations of the assertions of                     objectivity in science.  Professor Daston, under this grant, is                 examining not the contemporary debate about objectivity in science,             but the historical development of our modern view of objectivity.               She is preparing an examination of the history of the ideals and                practices of objectivity in the natural sciences from the rise of               modern science in the 17th century to about 1925 with the                       development of quantum theory with its \"uncertainty principle.\"                 Her study will trace the historical transformation of scientific                objectivity, revealing the range of alternative meanings it has                 taken on since 1600.  Each of these alternatives is rooted in the               daily workings of science--experimental techniques, metaphysical                assumptions about determinism and variability in nature, patterns               of professional sociability, theoretically grounded rules of                    evidence, division of scientific labor, a carefully cultivated                  sensibility that spans impartiality to self-effacement.  Not only               the attitudes but also the objects of objectivity evolve, creating              sharply contrasting prototypes of what counts as a fact in science.             The concept and conduct of objectivity are specific to discipline               as well as to historical period: astronomy, natural history, the                physics of electricity, and experimental physiology all evolved                 distinctive brands of objectivity in the 18th and 19th centuries.               By showing that objectivity itself has a history, Professor Daston              hopes to illuminate our own confused usage of the term which refers             to metaphysics, methods, and morals.",
