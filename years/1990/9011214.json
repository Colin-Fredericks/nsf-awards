 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the design of efficient parallel                 algorithms for solving various graph problems arising from disparate            areas in Computer Science.  These problems can be roughly divided into          three categories: graph layout problems, some fundamental problems for          planar graphs, and optimization problems for a class of special graphs          including permutation graphs, comparability graphs, and cographs.               Because of their broad applications in a variety of applied science             disciplines, sequential algorithms for these problems have been                 extensively studied.  But it appears difficult to solve them in                 parallel.  Either no fast parallel algorithms for solving them are              known; or parallel algorithms exist, but require a very large number            of processors.  The properties of these graphs and intrinsic                    structures of these problems will be investigated, and new parallel             algorithms for solving them will be developed (or the efficiency of             existing parallel algorithms will be improved).  A main concern of              this project is to identify common characteristics and to find                  algorithmic tools for the problems in each category.  The results               produced from this study will provide not only efficient parallel               algorithms for individual problems, but also new understanding of               these special graphs and new techniques for designing parallel                  algorithms.",
