 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flint (a microcrystalline quartz rock) is highly resistant to                   weathering and fractures to produce a sharp, durable cutting                    edge.  It was utilized by prehistoric peoples to manufacture                    tools for the processing of plant and animal materials.  Its                    availability was directly linked to the survival of many                        prehistoric human populations, and it was widely exchanged in                   prehistoric economic systems.  However, the patterning of this                  exchange is poorly understood largely because existing methods of               sourcing flint are unreliable.  Under the direction of Drs.                     Richard Yerkes and Gunter Faure, Mr. James Foradas, a graduate                  student at Ohio State University, will develop sourcing criteria                from samples derived from Vanport flint which is exposed in a                   number of Ohio outcrops.  The project will consist of four main                 stages.  Mr. Foradas will first collect specimens from a series                 of outcrops.  He will then conduct analyzes to characterize each.               These will include trace element determinations using X-ray                     fluorescence, petrographic, and SEM analysis.  On this basis he                 will then examine flints recovered in archaeological context from               a number of Scioto River Valley Hopewell culture sites.  Finally,               he will use these data to reconstruct Hopewell exchange patterns.                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  It will serve to               develop a non-destructive analytic technique for the analysis of                chert which can be used, hopefully, in a wide range of                          archaeological situations.  This should prove a valuable tool.                  Archaeologists are interested in how complex societies evolve,                  and the Hopewell culture marks one of the earliest manifestations               of such a large scale development in North America.  It has been                postulated that the regulation of trade in such valuable objects                as high grade flint served as an integrating mechanism, and Mr.                 Foradas' work will allow testing of this hypothesis.  Finally,                  this project will assist in the training of an extremely                        promising young scientist.",
