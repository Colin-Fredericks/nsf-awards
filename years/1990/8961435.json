 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will develop a family of novel optical devices                       based on optically addressed spatial light modulators                           employing polarization selective reflectors.  These devices can                 exhibit optical bistability at very low light levels, hence should              be useful for a wide variety of optical processing applications,                including memory.  The proposed devices will combine our                        already demonstrated high performance spatial light                             modulators with reflectors made from circularly dichroic thin                   films of cholesteric liquid crystal polymer.  The cholesteric                   liquid crystal polymer is intensely circularly dichroic,                        potentially cheap, and durable enough to make readily                           formed free-standing films.  Furthermore its optical                            properties are virtually temperature insensitive.  In phase I                   of our proposed SBIR work, we will synthesize a previously                      demonstrated cholesteric liquid crystal polymer and form a                      circularly dichroic thin film reflector.  In phase II our                       proposed work, we will modify a Displaytech optically                           addressed spatial light modulator by sandwiching the circular                   dichroic reflector between photosensing layer and the                           refractive layer.  We will also develop the cholesteric liquid                  crystal polymer into a useful optical material for optical                      material for optical isolators, durable laser blocking filters,                 and dichroic mirror coatings.",
