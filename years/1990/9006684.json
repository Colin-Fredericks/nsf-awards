 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Organic Dynamics Program,                         Professor Cynthia J. Burrows of the Chemistry Department at                     State University of New York at Stony Brook will study                          \"Biomimetic Oxidation Chemistry\".  Biological mechanisms of                     hydrocarbon oxidation and halogenation will provide the basis                   for the design of new transition metal catalysts for these                      processes.  The oxidation of organic substrates using metal                     catalysts is of great importance to the petrochemical industry,                 especially since oxygen-containing compounds (primarily ethers)                 will have great impact on the gasoline industry.                                                                                                                Mechanistic studies are underway in order to characterize the                   roles of nickel and the ligand in the catalytic epoxidation of                  alkenes with a terminal oxidant.  New macrocyclic ligands will                  allow the investigation of asymmetric induction in reactions                    with alkenes.  These experiments will seek to  distinguish                      between the intermediacy of metal oxo species versus electron                   transfer mechanisms.  Mechanistic information will be applied                   to the design of new oxidative transformations based on radical                 cyclization or ring opening reactions.  Related group transfer                  reactions such as aziridination and cyclopropanation will be                    investigated, as well as other metal complexes.",
