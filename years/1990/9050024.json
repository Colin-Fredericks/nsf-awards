 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to radically modify the                          introductory science courses offered at Mississippi State                       University to non-technical students.  A three semester                         sequence of courses to include content in biology, astronomy,                   physics, chemistry, and geology will be offered.  The major                     objective of the proposal is to provide preservice teachers                     with solid content in the disciplines while preparing them to                   teach science in the elementary school with an emphasis on                      the teaching of hands-on science.  Special laboratory                           sections will be developed for the preservice teachers which                    focus on application of content, use of guided-discovery                        methods, and the development of process skills.                                                                                                                 Prior to teaching of the revised courses, Arts and Sciences                     faculty will attend seminars focusing on current science                        education research, methods of teaching by discovery, and                       newly developed curriculum materials for the elementary and                     middle school student.                                                                                                                                          The preservice teachers, upon completion of the three-term                      sequence, will apply content knowledge and laboratory skills                    to the elementary education science methods course by                           planning lessons with increased science content and will                        translate laboratory activities into activities that are                        appropriate and meaningful to children.  During their student                   teaching experience. students will be placed with teachers                      who have been educated in a three weeks summer workshop to                      serve as mentors to insure that students are in classrooms                      where good science is being taught.  These mentors will be                      able to provide the encouragement and support that the                          perservice teachers need to teach science as they have been                     taught.                                                                                                                                                         The project evaluation will include following the students                      through student teaching and the first year of full time                        teaching.                                                                                                                                                       In the latter years of the project, there will be workshops                     and conferences to reach out to the other teacher education                     institutions in the state of Mississippi to share the course                    development and evaluation on a state wide basis.  Of                           Particular interest is the inclusion of the community                           colleges in the target for outreach.                                                                                                                            The cost sharing by Mississippi State is 58% of the amount                      requested from NSF.",
