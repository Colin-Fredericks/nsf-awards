 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout this decade our expertise in gas chromatography/mass                 spectroscopy (GC/MS) has greatly increased and, as a result, so                 has interest in, and anticipated utilization of this powerful                   instrumentation.  This project enabled the Chemistry Department                 to purchase a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer to replace                    unreliable instruments that no longer met the department's                      growing demands.  The acquisition gave the Department a modern,                 expanded GC/MS capability and has enabled the faculty to                        significantly improve the research and basic laboratory                         experiences of students in the following courses:  Organic                      Chemistry Lab, Integrated Organic-Inorganic Lab, Instrumental                   Analysis, Introduction to Research, Problems in Chemistry, and                  Undergraduate Chemical Research.  Non-majors enrolled in the                    introductory organic laboratory also gain exposure to GC/MS.                    Chemistry majors have extensive hands-on experience with state-                 of-the-art instrumentation enabling them to investigate,                        characterize and identify compounds related to their courses and                research.  The project also allows the department to include                    GC/MS in a new continuing education program which brings to                     campus high school chemistry teachers.  In summary, all of the                  capabilities of the instrument are utilized to provide the best                 possible educational experience, on several levels, for students.                                                                                               The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to the            NSF funds.",
