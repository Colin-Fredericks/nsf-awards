 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important factor in estimating a tsunami                                     hazard from a particular source is knowledge                                    of what previous tsunamis from that general                                     region have done.  The record of these                                          effects is far from complete for the U.S.                                       West Coast.  Given a return rate of 100 to                                      200 years for many great Pacific earthquakes,                                   and the changes in the population density,                                      coastal development, and coastal area usage                                     since the 19th Century, the hazard from a                                       repeat of these events is significantly                                         increased.  Of the 13 tsunamis with                                             amplitudes of 1 meter or more which occurred                                    on the West Coast, only the latest two, 1960                                    and 1964, caused damage of more than a few                                      thousand dollars.  These waves would not have                                   been particularly noteworthy had they                                           occurred in the 19th Century or early 20th                                      Century; reports of their effects would be                                      limited to local sources.  Conversely,                                          tsunamis which did occur in the 18th Century                                    without causing significant damage could be                                     destructive if they are repeated in the                                         future.  Automatic recording tide gages were                                    installed at San Diego and San Francisco,                                       California, and Astoria, Oregon in 1854, the                                    earliest operated in the Pacific.  The                                          publication of newspapers on the West Coast                                     began at a somewhat earlier date.  Using                                        contemporary records, extant tide gage                                          records, and a tide prediction computer                                         program, this project will improve the                                          quality of the historical record by adding                                      new descriptive and quantitative data,                                          correcting errors in existing knowledge, and                                    reducing the uncertainty of the source and                                      effects of reports of early tsunamis.                                           Analyses of the resulting improved data base                                    will show the unique features of the hazard.                                    This information is essential to the design                                     of effective tsunami warning systems and                                        other counter measures.",
