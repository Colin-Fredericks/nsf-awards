 "awd_abstract_narration": "The function of the nervous system depends on the proper                        connections between individual and groups of nerve cells.  Nerve                cells communicate with each other and with muscle cells through                 the release of chemical transmitters at close contact points                    called synapse.  While much is known about the structure of these               \"synaptic' connections, far less is understood about how these                  connections adjust to changes by drugs or endogenous chemical                   substances like hormones.  How the communication between nerve                  cells is changed or \"modulated\" in both the short and the long                  term is important to our understanding of the nervous system                    under normal conditions and those produced by disease.                          \"Neuromodulation\" may also be a consideration in the development                of new therapeutic approaches.                                                                                                                                  The chemical transmitters used by nerve cells to signal to each                 other are released from specialized areas called \"active zones.\"                The release process is dependent on the movement of calcium into                the nerve cell through channels which are clustered at these                    active zone regions.  Since the release of chemical transmitters                is dependent on calcium, any modulation of the movement of                      calcium through its channels can drastically affect the                         communication between nerve cells and from nerve cells to muscle.               This research project will study calcium movement in frog nerves                and in specialized cultured cells which may possess nerve-type                  calcium channels.  Unlike other preparations, these may provide                 direct access to nerve cell calcium channels in order to study                  neuromodulation.  In this way it is possible to understand the                  factors which control communication in the central and peripheral               nervous systems.",
