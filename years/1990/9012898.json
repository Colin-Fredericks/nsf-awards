 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will enable the investigator to complete the final                   chapters of a book in progress, \"Engineering Birth:  Science,                   Technology and the 'Perfect Child'\".  The central thesis is that                the new reproductive technologies interact with values and beliefs              about human perfectibility, to set norms for the \"perfect child.\"               Thus these developments recall, transformed, an old ideology.                   Parts I and II of the book set the historic and conceptual                      framework and explore the interaction of the ideology of human                  perfectibility and the new reproductive technologies today.  Part               III is the current project and poses the following question:  Why,              even while invoking the possibility of creating new or improved                 human beings, does much of the bioethics and feminist literature                fail to discuss how standards are being set, the criteria                       themselves, and what the meaning might be for the future direction              and use of such reproductive research?  The current research                    examines the bioethics and feminist critiques, situating them in                their milieus outside the medical arena, and compares them with                 values, norms and standards being set in medical contexts.  The                 chapters in Part III will show how the different cultures in which              the critiques are embedded inhibit analysis of the ways technology              and values interact to shape standards of human perfectibility and              the \"perfect child.\"  These differences inhibit dialogue as well                as attempts to influence or change the direction of research.  Some             of the feminist literature, however, provides ways to bridge these              divides.  Drawing on an experiential methodology that links theory              and practice, this work suggests integrative models for evaluating              procreative norms, and thus a means to link ethics, research and                practice.  The project calls attention to the positive role                     feminist perspectives can play in integrating ethical perspectives              and in setting frameworks for meaningful dialogue between persons               making ethical judgments and those involved in scientific and                   technological research.  The book manuscript that will result is                scheduled for publication in a new series on the philosophy of                  technology at a university press.                                                                                                                               This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional               support is very good; the research plan is sensible; the budget is              very modest.  Support is highly recommended.",
