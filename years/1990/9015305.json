 "awd_abstract_narration": "A training and research plan is described for the continued                     development and application of an already existing two-                         dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code to                        problems in astrophysics. Applications will be performed for                    three important problems: accretion disk dynamics, molecular                    cloud collapse during star formation, and the dynamics of the                   solar corona.  Planned improvements to the treatment of the                     microphysics in the code is expected to produce more realistic                  results.  Utilizing the already implemented algorithm for                       solving the radiation transfer equation in two-dimensions,                      self- consistent radiation intensity maps will be computed                      during the course of these simulations for direct comparison                    with observations, forming the basis of an interactive                          \"numerical observatory\".  The code will be implemented on a                     variety of machines at the NCSA to benchmark the performance                    of different architectures on the algorithms for MHD and                        radiation transfer. IN particular, the code will be implemented                 on the massively parallel Connection Machine.",
