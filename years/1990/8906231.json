 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within recent  years there has been increasing interest in                 the concept that some genetic elements may be \"selfish\" or                      \"parasitic\", i.e. they may have no function other than their own                propagation within a species.  Research here concerns the most                  extreme example of a parasitic element known, the psr (paternal                 sex ratio) chromosome in Nasonia vitripennis.  Psr is transmitted               normally, but then causes loss of the paternal chromosomes.                     Because males are normally haploid and females diploid in this                  insect, the effect of psr is to convert diploid female eggs into                haploid male eggs (which carry psr) by totally destroying the                   paternal genome.  Psr gains a transmission advantage from this                  phenotype because it has a high transmission through males and a                poor transmission through females.                                                   This is an excellent system for studying the evolution of                  parasitic genetic elements.  Research will be undertaken to                     answer the following specific questions, (a) What is the                        distribution of psr in natural populations?, (b) How does                       population structure affect frequency of psr? and (c) What is the               origin of the psr chromosome?  These questions can be answered                  because recombinant clones can be used to characterize the                      chromosome and for population studies.  In addition, procedures                 are established for population genetic studies of psr in both the               laboratory and field.  Genetic, cytogenetic and molecular                       studies will determine the structure of the psr chromosome.                     Field studies will determine the distribution of psr in North                   American wasp populations of 3 closely related Nasonia species.                 Laboratory population experiments will examine psr population                   dynamics under different population structures.  Finally the                    possible origin of sequences on the psr chromosome will be                      determined by comparing patterns in the 3 wasp species.                              Besides providing basic insight into the genetics and                      evolution of \"selfish \" DNA, the psr chromosome could be a                      tractable system for studying the genetic basis of chromosome                   imprinting.  Psr also has significant potential as a biological                 control agent of pest insects.",
