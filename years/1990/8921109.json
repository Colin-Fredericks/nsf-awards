 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth and change in federal domestic programs has proceeded at a               rapid pace over the last quarter century, producing a large and                 increasingly complicated maze of federal domestic spending programs.            In this research, the investigators examine the evolution of these              programs from 1965-1990 with the purpose of addressing basic                    questions about the inception and development of domestic spending              programs.  What are the typical characteristics of newly created                programs?  Why are some programs repeatedly reauthorized while other            programs are terminated shortly after adoption?  How do domestic                programs change over time?  Do the structural characteristics of                programs affect their longevity or how monies are distributed to                groups of recipients?  Compared to conventional research on these               topics, this project goes beyond examining spending levels, and asks            how these programs are organized and who receives benefits.                                                                                                     The approach taken in this project is based on a rethinking of the              legislative norm of universalism.  This norm suggests that members of           Congress prefer to support domestic spending programs that provide              \"something for everyone.\"  In its original conceptualization, the               norm of universalism suggested that all programs, both new and old,             provide benefits, albeit of varying levels, to every congressional              district.  In reality, this condition does not hold.  The researchers           suggest that domestic spending programs begin as fiscally modest                project grants, bestowing benefits to relatively few congressional              districts.  To survive successive legislative reauthorizations, these           narrow purpose grants must evolve by shedding their high application            costs, lowering eligibility standards, and distributing monies to an            increasing number of congressional districts.  Programs which fail to           conform to this pattern of change are expected to decline in size and           to become candidates for termination.  Hence only some programs are             expected to be universalized.  Among this select group, universalism            will tend to occur only through time.                                                                                                                           In order to undertake this investigation the researchers are                    developing a new data base.  The Catalog of Federal Domestic                    Assistance chronicles the changes in domestic spending since 1965 and           provides a rich source of information on which to base a systematic             investigation of the evolution of domestic programs.  A major part of           this investigation will involve extracting data from these catalogs             and compiling a data base on the population of domestic programs                over the past quarter century.  When complete, this data base will              contain annual information for each program including appropriation             levels, the type of program (e.g., formula grant, project grant,                direct loans, non-financial assistance, etc.), the functional policy            area served by the program, the categories of organizations and                 individuals eligible to apply and receive benefits, matching                    requirements, and other information.",
