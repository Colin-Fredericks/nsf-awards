 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information on litter turnover (leaf and fine root), plant-                soil interactions, nutrient cycling and soil organic matter                     dynamics is required to understand ecosystems managed for high                  biomass output such as agro-forest systems.  In the first                       hypothesis for this project the processes regulating nutrient                   cycling and soil organic matter formation are addressed.  This                  hypothesis will be tested by determining the contribution of leaf               and fine root litters to microbial growth, nutrient cycling and                 soil organic matter accumulation.  A new and innovative method                  of introducing tracers into young Populus trees makes it                        possible to follow the fate of C, N, and P from plant residues                  through the soil organisms into the active fraction of organic                  matter, and finally into the inorganic nutrient pool.  Isotope                  distribution and dilution measurements can distinguish the                      allocation of C, N, and P into plant, litter (roots and leaves),                and soil pools.                                                                      The incubation of previously labelled plant and soil organic               residues together with non-labelled substrates will allow us to                 test our second hypothesis.  This addresses the controls in N and               P mineralization.  Can microorganisms specifically attack                       substrates to obtain N or P deficient but C rich conditions?                    Answering this question is crucial in determining the capacity of               soil to provide nutrients for plant uptake via mineralization.                  Information from this project will be helpful in designing new                  management practices that promote self-sustaining nutrient cycles               in high yield ecosystems.  Populus plantations will be used as a                model high yield ecosystem.                                                          The research team assembled for this work is excellent and                 well experienced.  Facilities for the research are excellent.                   High rates of production of interesting and useful information                  may be expected.",
