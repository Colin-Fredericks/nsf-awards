 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-assisted three-dimensional modeling is being developed for             analysis of complex biological events. A computer system capable of             producing three dimensional simulations of various developmental                processes that would be student interactive, has been designed. Once            data are obtained and simulated, students can view the event from               various perspectives, shade or color any class of tissue, follow                specific highlighted areas during the developmental process, and make           video movies of any of these. An advanced course is being developed in          which a specific problem or system, for example the mechanics of                amphibian gastrulation, eye development, patterns of homeobox                   containing gene expression during early Drosophila development and how          they change in various mutants, neurulation, or heart formation, is             studied in detail and simulated. The same equipment will be used to             teach intermediate level courses in development or cell biology; this           would allow students to interact with the simulations as a visual aid           in understanding complex spatial relationships. Third, videos are being         made to assist in teaching introductory level courses and these videos          will be made available to other colleges. The college will contribute           an amount equal to the award.",
