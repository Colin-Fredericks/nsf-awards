 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr. John                   Griffin's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                 of his research at Stanford University. The thrust of Dr.                       Griffin's research is the isolation, purification and                           characterization of enzyme and antibody catalysyts for polyene                  cyclization reactions.                                                                                                                                          Enzymatic activity of purified cyclase will be quantified and                   the amino acid and gene sequence will be determined. The                        cyclizing acive site will be studied through affinity labelling                 and directed mutagenesis experiments.  This should permit the                   design and preparation of engineered enzymes having novel                       substrate and/or product specificities. Heterobicyclic                          immunogens will be synthesized which will elicit antibodies                     capable of initiating, directing and terminating the                            cyclization of diene epoxides. Once antibody catalysts have                     been identified, their mechanism of action will be studied.                     This should lead to a better understanding of sterol                            biosynthesis and macromolecular catalysis and may provide                       useful catalysts for the synthesis of sterols.",
