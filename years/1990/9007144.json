 "awd_abstract_narration": "Five related projects are proposed for a leaf mine-oak tree                system in which we will attempt to determine whether leaf-to-                   leaf, tree-to-tree, and tree-species-to-tree species preferences                of leaf miners results from differential egg hatching,                          differential larval performance, differential pupal mortality, or               differences in movement of adult moths between trees.  Previous                 research has shown that leaf miners show a distinct preference                  for different species of tree, different individual trees within                a species and different types of leaf within a tree.  Such                      preferences are maintained year after year.  Investigations into                such factors as leaf abscission, predation, parasitism, and host                quality of leaves as measured by amino acid content do not                      explain preferences of leaf miners for certain leaves or trees.                 The propose to move miner eggs between leaves, between individual               trees, and between tree species.  They also plan to move pupae                  between trees and to mark pupae with heavy metals to determine                  movement rates of adult moths that we will catch with sticky                    traps.  Such research will greatly increase of knowledge of                     forest dynamics.",
