 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (nmr) is an essential                   technique for the practice of modern chemistry and biology.  The                institution had spectrometers which were difficult to use and                   could not do many of the routine modern experiments, and were                   therefore an impediment to the study and use of nmr spectroscopy                in the curriculum.                                                                                                                                              Through this project the institution was able to obtain a 300 MHz               spectrometer.  The new spectrometer permits undergraduates to                   routinely obtain nmr spectra in the organic, inorganic, physical                chemistry, and cellular physiology laboratories, and student                    projects and senior thesis research.  The new nmr spectrometer                  provides such an increase in capabilities that it has had a                     profound effect on the nature of the experiments that students                  perform.  It addition, it greatly increased the rate at which                   they are accomplished.                                                                                                                                          The institution contributed to this project in an amount nearly                 double the NSF funds.",
