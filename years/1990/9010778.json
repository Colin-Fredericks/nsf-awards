 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parallel processing systems will be studied from a queueing                theoretic point of view, under general assumptions of stationarity              and ergodicity of the random input flow of jobs.  The jobs have                 some complex internal structure, consisting of multiple elementary              tasks, that have to be executed by a system of processors,                      according to some specifications.  The classical queueing theoretic             problems of stability, asymptotic stationarity etc. will be                     addressed, as well as control theoretic problems of optimal dynamic             scheduling of jobs to processors in order to optimize the                       performance of the system, for example, maximize the throughput.                Analysis will focus on basic prototypical models of parallel                    processing, capturing the essential operational characteristics of              large classes of parallel processing systems.                                        The research is important for understanding the operation of               parallel processing systems at a fundamental mathematical level and             establishing techniques to optimize their performance, based on a               solid mathematical methodology, contrary to the largely heuristic               current practice.",
