One                        important application for such processes is in optimal control                  and replacement problems for systems subject to deterioration                   and failure.  They will work with a class of system models for                  wear in which one component of a vector process is monotone.                    These systems are constructed from diffusions and dynamic                       programming techniques for the analysis of controlled diffusions                can be extended.  The monotonicity of the wear process provides                 additional structure and their analysis will take advantage of                  this structure.
