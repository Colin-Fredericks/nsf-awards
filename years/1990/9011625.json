 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Parshall is continuing her research on a biography of                       James Joseph Sylvester (1814-1897).  Sylvester was one of the                   major figures of 19th century mathematics.  As a key developer                  of the British school of invariant theory, he thrust Great                      Britain back into the thick of international mathematical                       competition.  As the first professor of mathematics at the                      Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, he brought research-                     level mathematics to the United States.                                                                                                                         Under this grant, Dr. Parshall is undertaking two separate                      projects designed to detail and clarify further Sylvester's                     place in the history of mathematics.  First, she is continuing                  her work with Paul Wolfson on the history of invariant theory.                  They are focusing on the period from Gordan's proof of the                      finiteness theorem in 1869 through Hilbert's complete                           generalization of it in 1893, and then tracing the impact of                    Hilbert's ideas on the area during the ensuing three decades.                   Second, she is completing a volume of selected Sylvester                        correspondence with historical and mathematical commentary.                     These two projects will serve to fill in the gaps which                         emerged as a result of the PI's prior research on Sylvester                     and will allow her to complete her biographical study of                        Sylvester's life, work and times.",
