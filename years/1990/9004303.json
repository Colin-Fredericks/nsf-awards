 "awd_abstract_narration": "Field mapping studies will be used to evaluate and apply the               critical wedge model of thrust sheet mechanics in an attempt to                 resolve existing conflicts between thrust sequences predicted by                the model and those suggested by geological evidence.  According                to the critical wedge model, the advance of the thrust belt under               the force of horizontal compression, requires that the wedge                    deform internally to attain and maintain a critical taper angle.                Potential taper-building mechanisms are:  out-of-sequence                       thrusting; duplex formation; and synchronous thrusting.  Field                  work began in 1988 and 1989 in the Sawtooth Range of the                        northwest Montana thrust belt during a previous award entitled                  \"Sequence of Thrusting:  Implications for Mechanical Models of                  Thrust Belts\".  Existing geological maps proved to be inaccurate                or inadequate for the purpose of detailed structural analysis and               the area had to be remapped.  Two additional field seasons will                 be required to completed the mapping phase.  The construction of                regional cross-sections, sequential restoration of the sections,                and forward modelling, will answer two principal questions:  (1)                which of the taper-building mechanisms were operative?  and (2)                 have they occurred in sufficient magnitude to have allowed the                  critical wedge model to function?",
