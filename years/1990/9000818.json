 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU activity would allow students to work closely with faculty to           combine advanced computing tools and techniques with fundamental                applications in the structural and materials areas of civil                     engineering.  Since seven other universities are presently working on           these projects, NCSU has an excellent opportunity to attract from               these schools qualified applicants who are already familiar with these          programs.  In addition, applicants from NCSU's Engineering Scholars             Program would be sought to participate in the REU site program.                                                                                                 The 10 REU program students will participate in a ten-week summer               research program.  All participants will live on campus, enjoy full             NCSU student privileges, and be able to interact easily with other              undergraduates and with graduate students and faculty.  Students will           attend weekly discussion sessions on their research projects and also           on such topics as proposals, publishing, and presentations.                     Additionally, they will be required to write and present a paper on             their research.                                                                                                                                                 The REU site offers valuable and enriched opportunity to each                   participant with its excellent research facilities, highly qualified            and experienced faculty, and past success with the REU program.",
