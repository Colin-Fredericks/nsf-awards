 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the improvement of techniques used                in the preparation of crystals of single proteins for subsequent                analysis by X-ray diffraction.  The award will permit systematic                studies of the growth of crystals of several well defined and                   widely available proteins by one of the leaders in this field.  The             data from these studies are expected to serve as an excellent                   reference for other investigators who wish to standardize and                   perfect their own technique.                                                                                                                                    In recent years, X-ray crystallography has assumed a central role               in the structural and functional analysis of enzymes and other                  proteins.  Much of the progress in this area has been due to                    progress in the collection and analysis of the diffraction data;                although there has been some progress in understanding the process              of protein crystal growth, difficulty in growing crystals of                    sufficient size and quality remains a significant stumbling block               in the analysis of most proteins.  The kinds of studies to be                   undertaken by the awardee should help to make this aspect of                    structural studies more routine and thus to facilitate the analysis             of many new proteins.",
