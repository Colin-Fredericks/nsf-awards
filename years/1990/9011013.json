 "awd_abstract_narration": "The haptic nervous system allows one to know about nearby objects               and surfaces by means of contact with the body.  Without having                 to look at an object, a person can get an impression of some of                 its properties by holding it and wielding it.  This research                    conceptualizes the haptic subsystem in wielding as a measurement                instrument which capitalizes smartly on lawful regularities, such               as the constant pattern of the resistances of an object to                      rotations in different directions.  The experiments will examine                the haptic perception of object length, angular separation of                   components, orientations, and shape.  They will do so for                       conditions where one object or two are held in the hand.  People                in the experiments will respond by adjusting (visible) movable                  surfaces or pointers to quantify the perceived properties.  The                 experiments will attempt to identify the mechanical variables                   that relate uniquely to the perceived geometric properties of the               hand-held objects, and to show that wielding must be done in a                  definite though complex way in order for a particular property to               be perceived.  Identifying these hand-related capabilities and                  their physical basis will help the design of sensory and motor                  prostheses, robotic limbs, and clever tools.  Understanding the                 form and function of haptic perceptual instruments will advance                 the theory of special purposes cognitive mechanisms.",
