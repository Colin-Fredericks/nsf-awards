During the past three years, in collaboration with colleagues                   from the NSLS, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, and IBM, the                       researchers have developed, instrumented and commissioned the                   soft x-ray undulator beamline X-1A, along with the apparatus for                scanning transmission microscope (STXM) and Gabor holography.                   The experimental program using these instruments has started.                   The initial operating experience points up several areas where                  further development will have a profound effect on the                          performance and usefulness of the facilities.  Some of these                    relate to improved resolution and increased capabilities of the                 instruments, while others involve auxiliary studies to elucidate                the range of applications for biological research.  In addition,                the PIs plan to participate in the user program, and more of                    their effort will be devoted to helping users during their early                experiments.",
