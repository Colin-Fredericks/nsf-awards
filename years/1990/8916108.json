 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sulfate activation (beginning with ATP sulfurylase), along with                 sulfate reduction to cysteine (beginning with APS                               sulfotransferase), is located on the inner mitochondrial membrane               of Euglena, but is absent from the chloroplasts.  Sulfite (or                   cysteine) from the mitochondria is used by the chloroplasts as a                precursor of the sulfolipid sulfonic acid group.  This research                 examines 1) phosphate inhibition of purified mitochondrial ATP                  sulfurylase as a means of determining its regulatory                            significance, 2) the cellular location and properties of a second               different ATP sulfurylase purified from whole cells and, 3) the                 mechanism of purified APS sulfotransferase.  The flow of sulfur                 compounds out of the mitochondrion to chloroplast serves as a                   model system in which to explore the origin of chloroplast                      constituents during plastid development and the nature of                       mitochondrial transport processes.                                                                                                                              Sulfate is the common form of sulfur in aerobic environments.                   Sulfate must be metabolically activated before it can be used for               important reactions in cells.  Since sulfur is an essential                     nutrient for plants, an understanding of sulfate metabolism is                  essential for understanding the normal agricultural (and                        ecological) utilization of sulfur, as well as the consequences of               sulfur deficiency and its correction.  This research extends the                examiniation of sulfur metabolism to the chloroplast and                        mitochondrion of the unicellular alga, Euglena because recent                   evidence indicates that there is a flow of sulfur metabolites                   between these two organelles.  Therefore, this research provides                not only for an understanding of sulfate metabolism at the                      subcellular level, but also shows how these organelles are                      coordinately controlled and how they share the cellular resources               available for organelle development.",
