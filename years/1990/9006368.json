 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trichomycetes are fungi that live obligately within the guts               of many kinds of arthropods such as crustaceans, millipedes, and                insects.  The nature of the relationship with their hosts is not                known in most cases although there is evidence that some of these               fungi can kill their hosts whereas others may benefit them by                   synthesizing sterol nutrients required by the host.  Dr. Robert                 Lichtwardt of the University of Kansas is one of the few                        specialists in the world working on the taxonomy and biology of                 these commensalistic fungi, and it is his efforts over the years                that have led to the present stage of knowledge about them.                          In continuing studies of Trichomycetes, Dr. Lichtwardt is                  surveying their occurrence in aquatic hosts in two widely                       separated regions, Australia and New Zealand and in Costa Rica.                 Preliminary work by him has indicated that new species of fungi,                and possibly new genera, occur in both regions, and with varying                levels of specificity toward their hosts.  Efforts to culture the               fungi under controlled laboratory conditions will continue, along               with studies to determine their complete life history, including                processes by which fungal spores are dispersed and come to infect               appropriate host arthropods.  Dr. Lichtwardt's studies also                     contribute to the inventory of microbial organisms in the world,                especially of tropical regions, an inventory at present very                    incomplete.",
