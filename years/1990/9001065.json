 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants produce many more ovules than develop into seeds.                    Some ovules may not develop into seeds because pollen tubes fail                                                                                                to reach the ovary and fertilize ovules; other ovules are                       fertilized and then aborted.  The failure of an ovule to develop                                                                                                into a seed can also depend on the genotype of the pollen donor.                                                                                                In general, seeds sired by foreign pollen are more likely to be                 developed over seeds sired by self pollen when both types of                    seeds are competing in the same fruit.  There have been few                     investigations attempting to determine the mechanism of                         preferential development of outcrossed seeds although many                      authors have hypothesized that variation in pollen tube growth is                                                                                               important.  Pollen tubes of certain donors may simply not get to                                                                                                the ovary and fertilize any ovules.  Patterns of preferential                   development could also be caused by selective abortion if seeds                 sired by self pollen are aborted with greater frequency than                    seeds sired by foreign pollen.                                                       Despite the possible role of seed abortion in determining                  patterns of preferential development, abortion of seeds sired by                                                                                                specific pollen donors has not been examined in any plant.  The                 proposed work differs from previous studies because it will look                                                                                                at both variation in pollen tube growth and seed abortion.  The                 PIs have developed a technique that enables them to determine the                                                                                               genetic makeup of ovules as they begin to abort.  Preliminary                   data suggest that seeds sired  by self pollen are aborted with                  greater frequency than seeds sired by foreign pollen.",
