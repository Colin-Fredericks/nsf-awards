 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Phase I effort has demonstrated that holographic windows for                daylighting is a viable and valuable technology.  The holograms                 effectively and efficiently diffract sunlight.  The Phase I effort,             as expected, uncovered several problem areas requiring additional               research.  In particular, to optimize the effectiveness of the                  holograms, high quality gelatin films of uniform and controlled                 thickness must be prepared.  Commercially available films may be                used for demonstration, but are not optimum.                                                                                                                    The chromatic problem was addressed by overlapping patterns from                adjacent holograms and this area needs some further work.  An                   invention under the contract using a film with imbedded mirror                  elements shows promise of deploying an inverted spectrum to mix                 with the direct spectrum.                                                                                                                                       Other research areas for the Phase II effort were anticipated,                  namely those associated with scale up to a full size room                       illumination demonstration.  The research will focus on both the                fabrication of large holograms and the measurements of total room               illumination.",
