 "awd_abstract_narration": "The economics literature includes several distinct strands of                   inquiry into philanthropic behavior. This project expands the                   literature from  focus solely on monetary giving to include the                 role of volunteer labor.                                                                                                                                        Although dollar estimates of the value of volunteer effort in the               U.S. exceed estimates if the value of monetary giving, research                 into volunteer labor supply has been scarce, hampered by a lack                 of data. Recent results have given information on the                           substitutability of time for money in the utility function of                   givers, allowing the possibility of extending the literature on                 crowding out to include volunteer labor.  Charitable                            organizations use paid and unpaid labor and cash donations as                   inputs in producing charity. For various specifications of the                  productions function, the interrelatedness of gifts of money and                gifts of time have implications for the degree of crowding out                  experienced in the economy as government varies its levels of                   spending for similar causes.                                                                                                                                    Another direction of the research lies in the parallel between                  models of strategic altruism and the possibility of a strategic                 motive for giving through volunteer labor. The strategic altruism               literature shows instances in which gifts made contingent on                    behavior can elicit efficient behavior from agents who would                    otherwise \"misbehave\". Many charitable organizations produce                    services which are difficult to measure, not in quantity and                    quality. If managers if nonprofits have incentives to deviate                   from the behavior desired by their donors, and if volunteer                     labor has, through proximity, a superior opportunity to monitor                 the actions of a firm than do more distant donors of cash, there                may be a strategic motive for giving time rather than money.                    Furthermore, charitable organizations have a strategic motive for               employing volunteers as a signal that they are truly behaving in                accordance with the goals of their donor population.",
