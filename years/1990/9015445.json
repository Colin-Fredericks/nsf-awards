 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is funded under the Special Initiative on                         Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology.  This is one of               eleven winners under that competition.                                          The object of this research effort is to exploit a wholly new                   interactive window concept, already experimentally implemented in               the laboratory, as a basis for construction of flexible new forms of            collaboration environments.  These environments will allow                      collaborators to work within a shared information space whose                   structure adjusts easily to and whose visual form naturally                     expresses the inherent structure of their collaboration.  The first             stage of this research is to define and implement a basic                       collection of functions in an interactive zoomable window system.               This system will then be extended across a network, thereby making              available a shared information space which will allow an arbitrary              number of users to work in a common virtual environment, each                   possibly enjoying a different view of this environment.  Then a                 series of experiments to test the real benefit to collaborators will            be conducted.",
