 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of molecular dynamics techniques and their                      application to proteins has created demands for computing time                  that are demonstrably not being met by presently available                      resources.  Highly parallel computers offer an opportunity to                   satisfy this need economically, but so far this potential has not               been realized.                                                                                                                                                  This work will develop software modifications for doing molecular               dynamics of peptides and proteins, optionally in solution, and                  specifically with options for computing free energy differences.                This development shall take place on a 24-node parallel computer,               the newly announced \"Chemputer\", a parallel machine with                        hypercube architecture.  The machine will be delivered with                     efficient software for molecular dynamics.  The plan is to adapt                this software to perform the most \"modern\" calculations.  These                 extensions will be made generally available.",
