 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of physical studies will be performed to examine how                   the carbohydrate side chains of a glycoprotein (and their                       chain length) affect the secondary and tertiary structure of                    the glycoprotein, the thermodynamics of unfolding and 3-                        dimensional structure.  To accomplish these goals:  (1) a                       series of derivatives of beta2 glycoproteinI  (B2GPI) will be                   prepared and isolated using specific enzymes to sequentially                    remove individual carbohydrate residues from each of the                        N-linked chains; (2) the solution conformation of each                          derivative (both secondary and tertiary structure) will be                      examined using far and near UV CD spectroscopy.  These                          studies will be performed as a function to temperature in                       aqueous buffers.  The solvent environment will also be varied                   to investigate the effect of different solvents (aqueous                        buffers, ionic strength, pH, organic solvents) have on the                      conformation of each derivative; (3) the thermodynamics of                      unfolding of each derivative will be examined using high                        resolution calorimetry.  This will provide energetic                            information on the effect of carbohydrate chain length on the                   thermal stability of each derivative.   Aqueous buffer, ionic                   strength and pH will be varied.  The thermodynamic data will                    be correlated with the structural data provided in goal (2);                    (4) native B2GPI, one partially deglycosylated and the totally                  deglycosylated derivatives will be crystallized.  The effect                    of carbohydrate chain alteration on the conditions for                          crystal growth and crystal structure which may arise from                       alteration of the conformation of the folded polypeptide as a                   result of removal of defined carbohydrate residues will be                      examined.",
