 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the development of the                      cultural landscape around Lough Gur, Co. Limerick, Ireland.  It                 will be primarily based on analysis of lake sediments and                       archaeological sites from the Neolithic the Medieval period.                    These materials are particularly well suited for testing several                hypotheses concerning vegetational and erosional changes                        resulting from human impact on the environment through time.  The               overall hypothesis states that Post-Boreal changes in the                       vegetation accompanied by erosion reflect local prehistoric and                 historic farming.  Subsidiary hypotheses are:  That the locality                of vegetation disturbance in the lake catchment changes through                 time and can be traced by paleomagnetic analysis of the lake                    sediment.  That the elm population was primarily affected by tree               cutting during the early colonization of lighter soils by                       humans.  That the relative frequency of algae in the sediment                   corresponds to fluctuations in lake catchment settlements.  And                 that the elm decline is an outcome of disease and is not                        associated with erosion.",
