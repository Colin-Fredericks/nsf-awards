 "awd_abstract_narration": "While estrogens have long been known to have profound                      effects on reproductive physiology and behavior, this steroid                   hormone also alters feeding behavior, body weight gain and lipid                metabolism.  It is believed that these wide range of effects of                 estrogens are mediated through a receptor-dependent process.                    Specific protein receptors are localized in target cells within                 distinct brain regions and compounds that interfere with steroid-               receptor binding activity attenuates the hormone response.                      Indeed these compounds, also known as antiestrogens, are an                     excellent tool for elucidating the mechanisms underlying the                    action of estrogen.  An extremely interesting finding is that                   these synthetic agents partially or fully antagonize the effects                of estrogen on reproductive physiology and behavior but mimic the               effects of estrogen on regulatory processes, such as feeding.                   Dr. Gray will examine the receptor systems by which these                       antiestrogens exert their estrogenic agonistic vs antagonistic                  effects.  She has demonstrated the presence of two specific                     antiestrogen binding sites in different brain regions.  She will                now characterize the distribution and binding properties of                     antiestrogen binding sites in the CNS.  The results from these                  studies should lead to a better understanding of how estrogen                   exerts its complex effects on both reproductive and regulatory                  systems.  Moreover, antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, nafoxidine,               clomiphene, are widely used for the treatment of estrogen-                      dependent breast tumors.  Her work on receptor mediation of                     antiestrogen effects may help us understand how these compounds                 act as growth suppressants in tumor cells.",
