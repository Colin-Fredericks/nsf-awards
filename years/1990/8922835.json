 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Dr. Frederick D. Lewis at Northwestern                       University, who is studying organic photochemistry.  The                        investigation will utilize light to bring about chemical                        changes, and it is expected to lead to the development of new                   or improved chemical reactions and to provide an enhanced                       understanding of how chemical reactions occur.                                                                                                                  The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Lewis are comprised of                 studies involving two broad cagetories of reactions: (1) those                  in which photoinduced electron transfer provides the driving                    force for subsequent chemical reactions, and (2) those in which                 the photoreactivity of organic molecules is enhanced by means                   of ground-state complexation with strong Lewis acids.  The                      ground states and the reactive intermediates (exciplexes and                    radical ions) in these reactions will be characterized by                       transient spectroscopy and by their chemical behavior.",
