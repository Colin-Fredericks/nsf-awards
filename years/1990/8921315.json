 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                    chemistry and in the subfield of separations science.                           Professor Sarah Rutan will study the structure of stationary                    phases used in liquid chromatography.  By using a combination                   of optical spectroscopy of molecular probes in specific solvent                 environments she will determine the so-called solvatochromic                    parameters of the system.  From this approach the fundamental                   structure and reactivity of the molecular species at the liquid                 solid interface can be determined.  A better understanding of                   the mechanisms of molecular interactions which give rise to                     separations of molecular species in flow will result.                                                                                                           Molecular interactions between probe molecules and liquid                       chromatographic stationary phases will be determined.  Optical                  (uv-visible and infrared spectroscopic band shifts will be                      measured and analyzed to remove solution phase interferences.                   Dipolarity-polarizability, hydrogen bond acidity and basicity                   will allow an understanding of solvent based reactivity and                     adsorption effects underlying separations and other liquid                      solid interfacial systems.  The particular solvent systems will                 include methanol, acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran - water                      mixtures commonly used in high performance liquid                               chromatography.  Hydrocarbon and phenyl modified silica as well                 as unmodified silica will be studied.  The probe molecules                      include a series of nitroaniline dyes commonly used to probe                    solvent solute interactions.  Unique capabilities to perform                    multicomponent analysis and eliminate the contributions of                      liquid phase effects will allow improvement over the current                    level of understanding of the dynamics of adsorption at the                     molecular level in solution.",
