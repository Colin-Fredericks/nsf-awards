Drs. Mark Buchheim and Russell Chapman at Louisiana State                       University have gathered preliminary evidence that indicates that               many of the 500 or so described species of Chlamydomonas are not                valid and that textbook examples of the evolution of motile                     colonies of algae from unicellular Chlamydomonas must be re-                    examined.  The extensive use of this organism and some of its                   relatives in cell biology and molecular biology research, as well               as its prominence in virtually all textbook coverages of green                  algae, make the study of this eukaryote unicell especially                      important.                                                                           Nuclear encoded ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences will be                     obtained through direct sequence analysis using reverse                         transcriptase enzymes or through polymerase chain reaction                      amplification of ribosomal DNA.  Sequences are aligned by                       computer and used as characters for taxonomic evaluation of the                 most likely pattern of phylogenetic splitting leading to the                    several subgroups of Chlamydomonas currently recognized.  The                   phylogeny so obtained will test whether colonial or multicellular               forms of green algae have evolved only once or several times, and               from what likely ancestral lineages.",
