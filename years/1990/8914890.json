 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Payne's research will test the evolutionary implications               of the biological species concept.  This the idea that                          individuals with a common set of behaviors for breeding form a                  single class, and individuals in it are genetically more similar                to each other than to others because they have a common ancestor.               The idea implies that a species has evolved only once.  In a                    parasite animal species, a host may be colonized more than once.                The colonizers may come from a single other species or from                     different parasite species.  If parasite species have adapted                   more than once to a host, then a biological species with                        lookalike behaviors may consist of individuals that                             genealogically are more closely related to other populations than               to each other.  The aim is to compare biological and historical                 species concepts, and to test whether a biological species has                  evolved more than once or has a unique history.                                      The parasitic finches are a unique group of birds.  They may               reveal a difference between a biological species and an                         evolutionary species viewed as a unique historical lineage.  The                birds learn the songs of their host species, and use these songs                in choosing mates.  Their song changes every year in a continuous               process of cultural evolution.  Geographic variation in their                   appearance and behavior suggests a multiple colonization of the                 host species.  The work will use behavioral and biochemical                     genetics methods to test whether the parasites have split along                 the same evolutionary pathways as the host species, or whether                  parasite populations of the same biological species have multiple               origins due to independent colonization events.",
