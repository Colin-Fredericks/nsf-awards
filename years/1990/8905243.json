 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will develop parallel algorithms for machine                      vision, especially for the interface between image processing and               image understanding, with further study of new and existing                     parallel architectures for efficient execution of these                         algorithms.  Architectures to be studied include fixed-size                     arrays, reconfigurable meshes, reduced VLSI arrays, and arrays                  with hypercube connections such as the Connection Machine.  Data                movement techniques will be designed to support parallel                        solutions to image computations in mid-level and high-level                     vision.  Specific high-level problems to be studied are motion                  analysis, image matching, and stereo matching, as well as several               discrete relaxation techniques.  Neural-net approaches to vision                will be supported by design of routing techniques based on                      preprocessing of the underlying neural graph and by mapping of                  such structures onto fine-grain parallel machines.  A Connection                Machine at the USC Information Sciences Institute will be used to               evaluate data partitioning, data routing, and mapping techniques.",
