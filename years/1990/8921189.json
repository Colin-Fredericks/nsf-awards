 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study the time-dependent                   propagation of waves past obstacles using a numerical scheme that               incorporates approximate far-field boundary conditions derived                  asymptotically.  A straightforward numerical solution of such                   problems is usually very difficult because the domain is                        unbounded.  The research in this proposal should help to remove                 many of the difficulties associated with the boundary conditions                at infinity.                                                                         Many problems in nature involve the flow of liquids and                    gases past obstacles, think of your car or an airplane or a boat.               One of the difficulties in finding solutions of such problems                   stems from the fact that the flow domain is infinite, and so one                must replace the infinite problem with a problem on a finite                    domain.  This is also tricky, but the present proposal contains a               method for choosing the right finite domain on which to perform                 numerical calculations.",
