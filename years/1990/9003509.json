It is expected that the                   presence of fluorine will endow the new compounds with                          desirable properties, such as special high temperature                          stabilities and concommitant high densities and long liquid                     ranges, compared to nonfluorinated analogs.                                                                                                                     The target compounds for synthesis are in three families:                       (A) fluorinated cyclophosphazenes and polyphosphazenes;                         (B) fluorinated tetrazoles and other tetraza-5-membered ring                    systems; and (C) fluorinated high-nitrogen compounds. Many of                   the new compounds will be synthesized by procedures analogous                   to those used for nonfluorinated analogs, but using fluorinated                 starting materials. In other cases fluorination will be                         accomplished with either carbonyl fluoride or trifluoroamine                    oxide. The new compounds will be characterized by a variety of                  spectroscopic methods and by x-ray and electron diffraction                     structural techniques.",
