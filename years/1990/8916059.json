 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research covers theoretical investigations, experimental                    work, and practical techniques in logic programming and deductive               databases. Research is conducted on extending well-founded                      semantics of logic programs to general well-founded logic                       programs and then to disjunctive well-founded logic programs.                   Their model theoretic, proof theoretic and fixpoint semantics are               investigated. Proof procedures are planned for implementation.                  In deductive databases, alternative definitions of null values                  and to develop their model theoretic, proof theoretic and                       fixpoint semantics are investigated.  Proof procedures that are                 developed are considered for implementation. In the area of                     disjunctive deductive databases, bottom-up and top-down                         computation methods are to be investigated, algorithms that are                 free of implications are studied, and finally the general case                  with implications is considered.  Computing answers to negated                  queries and conditions under which one might reasonably compute                 answers in disjunctive databases are also investigated. In                      separate efforts, investigations into approximate answers to                    disjunctive logic programs and research in parallel inference                   systems are conducted. The research will be useful for the                      development of knowledge base systems and deductive databases in                which the application requires disjuncts as part of the theory.",
