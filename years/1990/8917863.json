 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ribosomal RNA is one of the most informative, useful and highly                 studied molecules in biology.  Biologists utilize it in three main              ways:  (1) as a tool for establishing the systematics of                        microorganisms (and for refining and extending the systematics of               higher organisms); (2) as a phylogenetic characterization of                    natural populations and as an adjunct to diagnosis of bacterial                 infections; (3) as a powerful approach to studying the evolutionary             process; and (4) in its own right, as the function-defining                     component(s) in the translation apparatus.                                                                                                                      As the body of available ribosomal RNA data grows, scientists will              increasingly require automated tools to help them store, manage,                and analyze these data.  This project is aimed at meeting those                 needs through the development of an integrated rRNA data management             and analysis facility.  Specifically, the project will entail (a)               developing of a new generation of software for entering,                        manipulating, and maintaining ribosomal RNA sequences and related               data, (b) maintaining an up-to-date collection of ribosomal RNA                 data in an aligned format, (c) using these data for continued                   analysis of evolutionary relationships, (d) integrating ribosomal               sequence data with other information concerning the ribosome, and               (e) distributing these data and programs to the research community.                                                                                             In addition to meeting the needs of researchers interested in                   ribosomal RNA data, this project will serve as a prototype for                  future systems that will need to be developed to manage the large               collections of sequence data that will result from the many genome              research projects currently underway.",
