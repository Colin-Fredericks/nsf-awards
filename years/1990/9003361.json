 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two investigators will study Kleinian groups and Teichmuller               spaces.  One will analyze deformation spaces and cohomology of                  Kleinian groups, moduli of Riemann surfaces and their explicit                  representations, automorphic forms, and projective structures.                  The second will continue his investigation into the structure of                Kleinian groups and hyperbolic 3-orbifolds emphasizing the                      classification of geometrically finite groups and combination                   theorems.                                                                            The two investigators will work toward solving several                     problems related to the study of Kleinian groups.  An example of                such a group would be a collection of motions of the plane which                preserve a periodic tiling.  As elements of a group these must                  satisfy several axioms including one which requires the existence               of an inverse element associated with each element of the group.                If one element translates the plane by two units to the \"right,\"                its inverse element would translate the plane two units to the                  \"left.\"  The study of such motions has led mathematicians to the                solutions of problems involving crystal structures.",
