 "awd_abstract_narration": "Complexity can be considered the primary foundation of theoretical            computer science.  It is the study of computability with limited                resources.  A problem that has stimulated a large body of work in               structural complexity is whether all sets equivalent under various              reductions are polynomially isomorhic.  In 1977, J. Hartmanis and               L.Berman conjectured that all NP-complete sets are polynomially                 isomorphic.  This is still open.  In most instances of difficult                problems, it has been straightforward to construct oracles to decide            the problems either way.  In the case of the isomorphism conjecture,            this has not been true.  There is no known oracle for which the                 isomorphism conjecture holds.                                                     Dr. Goldsmith will continue to investigate the isomorphism                    conjecture.  She will continue working on self-reducibility and                 oracle accessibility.  She will investigate the difficulty of                   constructions in complexity theory by analyzing the complexity of the           statements of the theorems and the standard techniques for proving              them, using reverse mathematics.                                                  Interactive activities include teaching an undergraduate course at            the introductory level where it is crucial that role models be                  provided.  Dr. Goldsmith will also participate in complexity theory             and logic seminars and will continue her participation in the                   Northeastern Set Theory Seminar.                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a                      valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
