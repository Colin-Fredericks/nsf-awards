 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nashville State Technical Institute is one of five small                   Nashville institutions which Vanderbilt University is assisting in              connecting to NSFNET.  The 56,000 bit per second connection is made             through the mid-level network SURANET using the SURANET connection              Vanderbilt has had for two years.  Two of the institutions are                  historically black, two are small liberal arts institutions that                emphasize teaching rather than research, and one is a two-year                  technological school.  Nashville State is the two-year technical                school.                                                                              Benefits of the NSFNET connection include file transfers,                  electronic mail communication between local and remote researchers,             and remote login to and use of supercomputers and other research                facilities.  In addition, the local institutions have access to                 Vanderbilt's resources, and add another dimension to the diversity              of resources Vanderbilt can offer its students.  Cross-                         registration, software sharing and other benefits also result from              the network.",
