 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department has augmented its undergraduate                        curriculum by introducing chemistry students to gas                             chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).  Access to GC/MS has                  enriched all aspects of a previously already diverse                            undergraduate chemistry curriculum, ranging from the core areas                 of chemistry, e.g., organic, to biochemistry and environmental                  chemistry.  The theories and hands-on application of GC/MS                      analysis have been incorporated into most of the Department's                   courses, beginning with sophomore-level courses and extending to                the advanced courses, both in lecture and, particularly, in the                 laboratory.  Organic chemistry students use GC/MS to identify                   unknowns and products in reaction mixtures.  Environmental and                  instrumental chemistry students analyze \"real-world\" samples for                pesticides and other pollutants.  Biochemistry students analyze                 complex biological samples like plants for bio-molecules such as                sterols.  The acquisition of GC/MS also enhanced numerous                       undergraduate research projects.  The general aim of this project               is to enrich the chemistry students' educational experiences by                 introducing them to state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation,                specifically GC/MS.  Exposure to modern hyphenated modes of MS                  like GC/MS, in addition to the more traditional MS, is better                   preparing the students for continued study in graduate school                   and/or for a career in chemistry.                                                                                                                               The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
