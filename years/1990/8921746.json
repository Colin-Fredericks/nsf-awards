 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Dunlap is extending his prior studies of wildlife biology                   in North America to an examination of these issues in                           Australia and New Zealand.  The fauna and flora of these two                    countries present wildlife scientists with both unusual                         opportunities for research and serious problems in control,                     management and the application of ecological theory.  Under                     this grant, Dr. Dunlap is comparing North American and                          Australasian wildlife policies on pest mammals, on their                        policies for animals in national parks and wilderness areas,                    and on the development of scientific communities in wildlife                    biology.  He is also testing models of \"colonial\" science and                   \"center-periphery\" relationships among national scientific                      communities.  This project complements his previous NSF                         supported work on US wildlife policy and his further studies                    on Canadian policy.  This project will contribute to our                        understanding of wildlife biology in Australasia and the                        relation of wildlife scientists there to their counterparts                     in North America.  This grant will support Dr. Dunlap's travel                  and expenses for a six-week study of archival and library                       resources on wildlife management in Australia and New Zealand.",
