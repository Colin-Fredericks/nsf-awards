 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue his                    application of asymptotic methods of singular perturbation type                 to the study of bifurcation problems and moving boundary problems               that arise from reaction-diffusion systems.  In particular, he                  will investigate so-called singular bifurcation problems, wherein               small changes in the bifurcation parameter can cause large                      responses in the system, laser instabilities, and the changing                  time history of the moving interface in certain pharmaceutical                  problems involving the time-release of medication. This proposal                is concerned with bifurcation phenomena.  As an illustration,                   stand a plastic ruler on its end and push on the top end.  If you               do not push very hard nothing happens.  But if you push                         sufficiently hard the first thing that happens is that the ruler                bows, either to the left or to the right.  We call this a                       bifurcation:  the configuration of the straight ruler has split                 (bifurcated) into one of two possible shapes.  Applying still                   more force to the ruler results in an even number of bowed shapes               having more and more curves.  The principal investigator will                   study the number of solutions that bifurcate from a given                       solution of systems of equations that govern lasers and release                 of chemicals in the body.",
