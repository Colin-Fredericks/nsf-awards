 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Carnegie Museum of Natural History houses one of the                   most comprehensive bird collections in the New World.  During the               past ten years, support from the National Science Foundation has                improved research access to these collections through the                       installation of compactorized storage cabinets and implementation               of a computerized specimen database.  Origianl data entry was                   from collection ledgers, and the essential step of verifying the                accuracy of the computer records against individual specimens is                now commencing.  When data verification has been completed, the                 Carnegie Museum Ornithological Collections will be highly                       accessible to the entire community of systematic and evolutionary               biologists.                                                                          Modernization of natural history collections such as the                   bird holdings in the Carnegie Museum serve a wide research                      community.  This computer database will not only serve collection               managers and curators, it will facilitate more active use of the                collections and data for a variety of projects.  Land management                decisions, environmental impact analyses, natural resource                      conservation, and the full spectrum of evolutionary studies can                 benefit from this collection database.",
