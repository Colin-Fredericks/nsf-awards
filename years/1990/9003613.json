 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important insight about substances such as gold and glass is                 that each substance is made up of a unique kind of tiny                         homogeneous particle.  While adults generally share this belief,                little is known about how it develops as a child matures.  It is                crucial to develop this concept in order to make sense of the                   behavior of various substances and to predict that behavior in                  everyday life as well as in science classes.  For instance, this                concept can help children appreciate that matter can exist as                   invisible particles and maintain its inherent, and in some cases                potent, properties; that the inherent properties of an aggregate-               -e.g., whether it is safe to touch, eat, inhale--depends more on                the nature of its constituent particles than on its gross                       appearance.  This project will chart systematically how this                    important concept develops by examining whether children think                  that a substance maintains its identity and inherent properties                 despite dramatic changes in its chunk or grain size.  Identity                  refers to membership of a certain material kind (e.g., sugar);                  inherent properties are chemical properties described in ways                   that even young children can understand (e.g., smells good when                 it burns); and size can vary from a large chunk to smaller                      pieces, powder, or even invisible particles.  This project will                 also examine whether this concept helps children appreciate that                a substance such as sugar can continue to exist--in tiny                        homogeneous particles--even after it has become invisible upon                  dissolution.  A third goal is to explore how this concept may be                related to the way children and adults generalize what they have                learned about one sample of a substance to another sample of the                same substance.  Discoveries of links among different aspects of                children's understanding of matter can inform us about the nature               of children's theories of matter.  Such discoveries can enrich                  our understanding of how children and adults develop intuitive                  theories about the world.  Science educators can also make use of               such discoveries to develop curricula that young children can                   understand and from which they can learn.",
