 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectiveof the workshop is to address technical                       problems that are to be solved to allow users and organizations                 to build applications around interoperating data and knowledge                  bases.  This workshop, while dealing with the technology of                     information access and sharing will also forge a collaboration                  between industry and science.  The proposed workshop will advance               futher understanding of the issues faced by industry in utilizing               the results of distributed access to databases.  For some                       industrial problems conceptual solutions may be available.  For                 other types of problems the interaction will provide guidance for               researchers  in identifying and abstracting research issues that                must be addressed.  Interaction among researchers will help in                  identifying promising approaches as well as likely deadends.  The               collaboration and cooperation between basic and application                     researchers in solving applications problem can then be based on                a solid basic research foundation.  The workshop's effort in                    resolving technical problems facing researchers in developing                   multidatabases is closely related to technical problems described               in the recent NSF report (Toward National Collaboratory, NSF                    1989).  Clearly that problems of Intelligent Agents,                            Interoperable Data Description, Information Fusion, and Smart                   Data Gathering listed in that report are very same problems that                a designer of multidatabase application should solve to make an                 application operate with information geographically distributed                 among various data sources.",
