Three stations (plus a utility                     station) are used for the conduct of measurements in the three                  areas: optics, microwaves (frequency domain), and transient                     response.  All experiments are under computer control, and the                  students are responsible for some of the programming, starting                  with a basic core set of programs.  Students in the core course                 are required to carry out four prescribed investigations plus one               of their own design.  At the end of the course, they should be                  comfortable with computer control of instruments, and with some                 fundamental properties of electromagnetic signals in time and                   frequency domain.                                                               The principal equipment consists of: (1)  optical components,                   detectors, motion controllers, and fibers; (2)  microwave network               analyzer, and (3)  time-domain reflectometer.  Computer controls                are used for all stations.",
