 "awd_abstract_narration": "The outcome of many high order processes in ecology depends                on the way in which the abundance and distribution of plants                    affects the eating rate of plants by animals.  However,                         mechanistic models describing the operation of the functional                   response of herbivores have failed to emerge apart from those                   developed for predators.  The P.I. offer new models describing                  the effects of spatial and morphological characteristics of                     plants on the intake rate of plant tissue by vertebrate                         herbivores.  Their models depart from the Type II  response                     represented in Holling's disc equation by assuming that searching               for food and processing it are complementary rather than                        exclusive activities.  Their hypothesize that the parameters in                 our models should follow allometric relationships for linear and                surface dimensions of animals.  The P.I.'s conduct a randomized                 complete block experiment with a factorial layout to test the                   predictions of our models and to describe the allometric scaling                that governs their behavior.  Factors in the experiment will                    include animal body size, as well as plant bite size and biomass.               The investigator will observe responses to these treatments in                  vertebrate herbivores ranging in mass over five orders of                       magnitude.  The results will serve as a foundation for future                   development of a comprehensive model of feeding behavior in these               animals.",
