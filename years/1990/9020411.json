 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to being the deepest and largest (by volume)                        freshwater lake in the world, Lake Baykal in southern Siberia                   is intrinsically important to both geologists and biologists                    because of its central position in the tectonically active                      Baykal Rift Zone, its long stratigraphic record containing                      the paleoclimatic history of southeastern Siberia, and its rich                 endemic flora and fauna, establishing it as an important                        ecological system.                                                                                                                                              The purpose of this joint U.S.-U.S.S.R. workshop is to                          identify scientific priorities for international geological,                    geophysical, and ecological cooperative research on Lake                        Baykal and in the Baykal Rift Zone.  The meeting will be held                   October 17-25, 1990 in Columbia and Charleston, South                           Carolina.  Particular attention will be focused on the                          importance of the Baykal region to research in global change,                   global tectonics, the evolution of sedimentary basins, and                      biodiversity.  It will also provide opportunities for                           discussions between U.S., Soviet, and third-country scientists                  about common research objectives in the Baykal region and to                    develop specific plans and proposals for cooperative research.                  The U.S. Geological Survey is also contributing to the cost                     of this meeting.                                                                                                                                                This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest                     and competence in the field of basic scientific research on                     the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
