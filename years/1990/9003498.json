 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gaffney, Le and Massey will continue their study of the                    singularities of complex analytic spaces and mappings.                               Gaffney will investigate the equisingularity of families of                mappings using analytic invariants, extending his results to C-                 zero finitely determined germs, and he will continue to develop                 an infinitesimal theory of Whitney equisingularity using integral               closure operations.  With Massey, he will investigate the                       correct generalizations of the Le cycles to the complete                        intersection case.  Using blowing up operations, he will study                  the topology of maps between low dimensional spaces.                                 Le will investigate the relation between algebraic depth and               rectified homotopical depth, continuing his study of Lefschetz                  type theorems for singular spaces.  Le also plans to give a new                 proof of the Le-Ramanujam theorem using vector fields, and he                   plans to study the canonical decomposition of the local monodromy               of complex hypersurfaces and its links with the resolution of                   singularities and the geometry of polars.                                            Massey will investigate questions concerning a topologically               invariant decomposition of a constructible function, the Euler                  characteristic of the Milnor fibre of f-f(p) at p, and the                      related question of how the sheaf of vanishing cycles of a map                  decomposes as a perverse sheaf.  The machinery of the derived                   category should allow for a powerful attack on the structure of                 non-isolated hypersurface singularities.                                             Understanding singular spaces is important for realistic                   models of physical phenomena.  Perhaps the most widely known                    singularity is the cosmologists' \"big bang.\"",
