 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in \"New Foundations of           Computer Science\" between Professor John McCarthy, Stanford                     University, and Professor Masahiko Sato, Tohoku University, Sendai,             Japan, and several of their colleagues in the United States and                 Japan.  The purpose of the collaboration is to advance the                      understanding of mathematical foundations of computer science.  There           is need to bring together mathematical tools that have been developed           in basic research in computer science, to obtain a better                       understanding of these tools, and to develop new tools for studying             foundational issues.  Fundamental issues such as abstract and special           purpose logics, mechanized reasoning systems, and abstract                      descriptions of programming constructs are among the topics where               progress can be expected from the cooperative effort.  Progress in              these areas of basic research can have important consequences in                areas such as computer architectures, languages, and systems, as well           as in artificial intelligence and logic.                                                                                                                        The study of logics for computation, mechanized reasoning systems,              and theory of programming languages is a very rapidly growing field.            The U.S. and Japanese researchers taking part in this joint effort              have substantial expertise in the areas of logic, formal reasoning,             and mathematics as well as experience in the application of this                expertise to a wide range of basic problems in computer science.                Previous interaction among several of the scientists has been                   productive.  This current cooperative endeavor will provide an                  opportunity to discover new foundational methods and to apply                   existing methods to current problems of artificial intelligence and             programming language theory.",
