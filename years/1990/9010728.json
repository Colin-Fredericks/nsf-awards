 "awd_abstract_narration": "A class of utility functions is proposed which relaxes some of                  the restrictive assumptions constrains current models.                          Specifically, time and state separability are no longer required.               With respect to time separability, a recursive (due to Koopmans)                specification permits the consumption-leisure tradeoff in any                   period to depend on consumption and leisure levels in subsequent                times. This dependence weakens the a priori constraints imposed                 in the standard models on the relative responses of consumption                 and leisure to price and income shocks and this permits one to                  model more flexibly the intertermporal substitutability of each                 of consumption and leisure. With respect to state separability,                 this relaxed assumption has the flexibility to disentangle                      intertemporal substitutability from risk aversion.                                                                                                              A further contribution of this work is that it allows for the                   estimation of alternative utility specifications. The predictions               of the model developed in the theoretical section differ                        significantly from both the expected utility model and the                      separable model. These alternatives can be tested wither                        separately or jointly. Expected utility is a nested special case                and can be tested as a simple parameter restriction. Time-                      separability utility can be tested using non-nested tests. This                 project will provide the first such empirical testing of a model                that embodies both time and state nonseparabilities.                                                                                                            The approach taken here will enable a very flexible modeling of                 intertemporal substitution elasticities, allowing some separation               between risk preferences and substitution preferences and also                  allowing a greater separation between wealth and substitution                   effects. The empirical testing will permit a quantitative                       analysis of the importance of both state and time                               nonseparabilities for dynamic economic analysis.",
