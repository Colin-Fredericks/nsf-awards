 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rhythmic biological phenomena which occur at approximately 24 h                 intervals in the absence of environmental time cues are termed                  circadian rhythms. Two basic questions about circadian rhythms                  concern the mechanisms by which: 1) time information is used to                 regulate biological phenomena observed to be rhythmic, and 2) time              is measured. To address the former, genes have been identified                  whose expression is regulated in a circadian fashion in Arabidopsis             thaliana. Elements will be characterized that are required, in cis              or in trans, for this circadian regulation using gene fusion, gel               retardation and DNA protection strategies. The mechanism of time                measurement will be addressed through the identification and                    characterization of mutations which disrupt biological timekeeping.             The circadian rhythm in nitrate reductase will be explored to see               if the protein expression and mRNA levels correspond. If they do                correspond, nitrate reductase levels will be measured in an attempt             to screen for circadian regulation mutations. Fusion genes, in                  which clock control is conferred on a reporter gene will be used                as molecular tags on the biological clock in screens designed to                identify mutations  which affect clock function. The circadian                  rhythm in stomatal apertures will be used to select  mutants in                 which circadian regulation is altered. Characterization of these                mutations will identify elements either of the clock itself or of               the regulatory system by which time control is exerted. *** //",
