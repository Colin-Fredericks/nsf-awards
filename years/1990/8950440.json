 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve early computer science education at City              College by: (1) providing hardware and software that are very much              better suited to teaching elementary computer science than existing             equipment; and (2) building early courses in which lecture theory and           laboratory practice reinforce each other, leading to faster progress            and deeper understanding.  Both parts are essential:  improved pedagogy         would be very difficult using existing equipment and software, and new          equipment without innovative pedagogy would be wasteful.  With the new          equipment they will develop course presentation methodology that makes          the lectures more meaningful by immediately applying the ideas in a             laboratory setting.  Conversely, issues raised by prepared assignments          in the laboratory experience will stimulate thinking about issues in            such a way as to make subsequent lectures more meaningful.",
