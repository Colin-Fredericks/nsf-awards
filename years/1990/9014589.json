 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atlases consist of both maps and accompanying descriptions and             explanatory texts.  As a result, they are both written geographical             texts and works of cartography.  While maps are a fundmental medium of          geography, the texts accompanying them are crucial to any                       interpretation of the maps, and they lend substance to the abstract and         highly codified cartographic images.  This doctoral dissertation                research seeks to explain the sources and influences on atlases.  It            will try to explain how both maps and text are interrelated                     in the structure and discourse of atlases as a whole.  The earliest             English world atlases are closely related to the political, economic,           scientific, and social developments in seventeenth- and early                   eighteenth-century England.  This study aims to reconstruct the                 presence of this context within the content of the atlas texts.                 Specifically, the doctoral student will examine how information about           North America was structured and diffused by early modern world atlases         with English texts, and she will analyze the interrelationships of maps         and texts of atlases.  Atlas sections covering North America will be            analyzed in the contexts of their editorial and commercial theory and           practice in seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century England.  The             role of atlases as a medium of power and knowledge in the formation of          an English overseas empire also will be explored.  Historical                   reconstruction based on archival research in the U. S. and England will         take three forms:  the roles of atlases as practical documents; the             meaning of the atlases to contemporaries; and the social impact of              atlases in English society.                                                                                                                                          This project will illuminate several aspects of cartography.  The          theoretical and empirical contributions it will make will constitute            cutting edge research that is redirecting the history of cartography            toward increased intellectual significance.  The project will further           develop a method for the study of the systematic map-and-text                   arrangements that is vital to the study of human communication, and it          will expand the seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century historical            context for any further study of science and society in that period.            The project will also provide an excellent opportunity for a promising          young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
