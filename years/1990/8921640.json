 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of some freshwater and marine microalgae to                    ingest particulate food is a remarkable and ecologically                        significant behavior.  Despite the important implications of this               behavior for the flow of energy and nutrients in plankton                       communities and for the survival strategies of the algae, there                 has been relatively little experimental work to establish                       constraints on this behavior (i.e., maximum ingestion rates), to                examine the potential physiological benefits to the mixotroph                   (e.g., acquisition of C,N, or P), or to determine the competitive               advantage that this behavior might confer on the alga.  This                    project will continue research to obtain baseline data on this                  important, but generally overlooked, group of free-living                       protists.  Goals for future work are to continue to examine                     freshwater and marine isolates of mixotrophic algae in laboratory               culture for their ability to consume particulate food.  In                      addition, a survey of 10 lakes of varying trophic status and                    several environments in the North Atlantic Ocean will be                        conducted for the presence and abundance of mixotroph algae, and                the rates of bacterial consumption by these species.  Project                   fundings will contribute to ecological theory and the knowledge                 base with potential application to water pollution control.",
