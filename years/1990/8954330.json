 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference addresses the need of undergraduate experimental                 psychology faculty who lack first-hand experience with current                  neurobiology techniques and computer programs for laboratory                    experiences in learning, perception and cognition.  It also permits             such individuals to interact with leading experts in the field.                                                                                                 Participants are acquiring basic neurobiology techniques, developing            computer-based laboratory programs, participating in a network exchange         of teaching concepts, learning to establish modern computer-driven              operant laboratories at their home institutions, discussing significant         research and review articles, and interacting with leading experts in           experimental psychology and neurobiology.                                                                                                                       The twenty faculty are spending two weeks on campus studying                    neurobiology techniques, computer simulation and reviewing literature           followed by a third week interacting with eight experts at the Pingree          Park mountain campus.                                                                                                                                           Participants will return to their home institution with enhanced                teaching skills and subject matter content as well as insights into             improving laboratory experiences for undergraduates.",
