 "awd_abstract_narration": "Messenger RNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene                  expression and requires the action of the small nuclear                         ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs).  These particles consist                  of a small nuclear RNA molecule (snRNA) which is complexed with                 up to ten proteins.  Although the U1-U6 snRNPs are known to be                  essential for splicing, the specific functions of these snRNAs                  and their associated proteins are poorly understood.  Our long                  term objective is to define the roles of the RNA and protein                    components of the snRNPs, and to discover how these molecules                   contribute to the consummate specificity of the splicing                        reaction.  The goal of this proposal is to identify the precise                 function of a highly conserved snRNP protein called 70K, a                      component of the U1 snRNP.  The gene encoding the yeast 70K                     homolog will be cloned using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR).                 The clones gene will be used to generate a set of conditional                   mutations in 70K.  These mutants will be tested for their                       effects on U1-specific processes including 5' splice site                       identification, 5' cleavage site determination, branch site                     recognition, interaction with the pre-messenger RNA as well as                  with other proteins involved in splicing.",
