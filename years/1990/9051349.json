 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has been designed to significantly improve the                     chemistry curriculum at Snow College in both the classroom and                  the laboratory.  The project provides students with hands-on                    experience with a state-of-the-art Fourier transform infrared                   spectrometer.  The FTIR instrumentation and associated software                 also provide students with an introduction to computer-assisted                 data collection and manipulation and spectral database searching.               The spectral database is also used in the classroom to better                   teach the relationship between structure and spectral                           characteristics.  This instrumentation allows Organic Chemistry                 students to identify unknowns, follow reaction progress, identify               products, and help establish purity of synthesized compounds.                   Freshman Chemistry students use the instrument to identify                      functional groups and common polymers in their laboratory                       introduction to Organic Chemistry.  The instrument and associated               software are also used to develop scientific interest and                       curiosity in Introductory Chemistry students and outstanding high               school students and teachers in the area.                                                                                                                       The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
