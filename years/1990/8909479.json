 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparable worth pay plans have been implemented in at least                    seven states for government workers and are being considered in                 several other states.  While there have been a few descriptive                  studies conducted in order to help states decide whether to adopt               the legislation, little or no empirical work has been done on                   the impact of comparable worth on turnover, job vacancies,                      applications, and wage rates.                                                                                                                                   The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of                         comparable worth legislation on employment in state government.                 Focusing on Iowa during the period from 1980-1989, data from                    annual payroll tapes and state tabulations by job class will be                 supplemented with budget information by subdivision of government               to determine the consequences of the legislation on employment,                 applications, and turnover of female and male state government                  workers.  New hire, separations, and job transfers will be                      examined by sex, job, and division.  Trends, particularly in                    relation to gender and occupation, will be analyzed and special                 attention will be paid to how political and economic forces                     modify the implementation of pay proposals.                                                                                                                     It is very important to assess the impact of comparable worth                   laws on female employment and sex segmentation among jobs.  Not                 only will this research enable states to make better decisions                  concerning comparable worth legislation, but also it should                     provide insights into the role which wages play in helping public               agencies recruit and retain employees in general and female                     employees in particular.  Much of the criticism of comparable                   worth rests on claims about the effects it will have on total                   employment and the absolute level of employment.  This study                    presents an opportunity to evaluate the validity of this                        criticism.  It also permits studying the actual impact and                      implementation of law in a compelling arena of public policy.",
