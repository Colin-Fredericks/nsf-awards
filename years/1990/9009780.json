 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to improve the performance of            I/O subsystems in parallel architectures.  I/O subsystem design is an           issue which is often ignored by parallel computer designers.  With the          fast advances in VLSI and multiprocessor technology the processing              power and main memory speeds have been increasing at rapid rates but            the I/O system has hardly seen any comparable improvements.  This               disparity in performance gives rise to the I/O bottleneck in parallel           architectures.  The proposed investigation focuses on issues related            to the improvement of I/O subsystem performance.  Emphasis will be              placed on I/O schemes for hypercube multiprocessor architectures.                                                                                               Efficient parallel I/O schemes for hypercube architectures are                  studied.  Simulations are done mainly using some I/O bound problems,            viz., external sorting, database manipulations, etc.  Parallel                  algorithms are developed for such problems on the hypercube with a              parallel I/O environment.  Furthermore, different disk organizations            and data distribution schemes for the parallel I/O systems will also            be evaluated.  The results obtained in this project will enable                 researchers to design database and transaction processing systems and           provide insight for improving the performance of I/O subsystems on              other architectures.",
