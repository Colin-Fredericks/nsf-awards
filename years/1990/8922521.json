 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professors Qi Lu and Berzins of the Naval                   Postgraduate School, plus a postdoctoral associate, for research                visits to the Institute for Systems Engineering of the German                   National Research Center for Computer Science (GMD), where they                 will collaborate primarily with Dr. Bernd J. Kraemer.  The objective            of their proposed research collaboration is to extend the rapid                 prototyping language PSDL, which applies to hard, real-time                     systems, to include specification concepts and implementation                   techniques suitable for distributed applications.  Several major                components of the plan will be development of a semantic model                  supporting both prototyping and available verification techniques               for distributed programs, scheduling and resource allocation issues             related to prototype execution on multiple processors in the                    presence of resource contention, and a two level approach to                    prototype execution which uses both executable specifications and               reusable software components.  The project plan relies on partly                complementary skills in language and tool design, experimentation,              and theoretical analysis of the cooperating parties to reduce the               use of resources in solving problems of common concern.  Some of                the best work in this area in the world is being done in Germany,               and the U.S. senior investigators are highly regarded.                                                                                                          Finding effective and efficient methods for determining and                     validating the requirements for a software system is an important               unsolved problem in software engineering.  Prototyping is an                    iterative development and evolution process that promises to                    produce reliable and user-accepted software.  The emergence of                  multiprocessor systems poses new challenges to software specifica-              tion, design, and validation.  Correctness checking and deadlock                detection become crucial because the nondeterminism and infinite                behaviors commonly found in distributed programs make it impossible             to test them sufficiently.  The research proposed here will make a              solid contribution to these problems.",
