 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI has devised a method to determine atmospheric pressure                   based on vesicle size distributions in basaltic lava flows.  The                size and space distributions of vesicles is dependent on                        migration and coalescence processes which can be modelled, as                   well as flow thickness and atmospheric pressure.  The atmospheric               pressure dependence arises from the sensitivity of the size                     distribution to decompressive expansion during bubble rise                      through the fluid lava.  The objective of the research is to                    refine and implement the method on modern basalts emplaced at                   high and low elevations, thereby calibrating the sensitivity of                 the technique.  During phase II, the analysis will be applied to                ancient low elevation baslts to measure paleo-atmospheric                       pressure.  This work will provide the first data on paleo-                      atmospheric pressure, thus shedding light on planetary degassing                and evolution of the atmosphere.  Once sea level pressure is                    known, the technique can be used to obtain paleo-elevation of                   mountain ranges, with implications in paleogeography and                        atmospheric circulation.  In addition, the bubble size                          distribution as a function of stratigraphic position in a flow                  can be used as a measure of lava viscosity, and should yeild more               accurate results than previous estimates.                                       In order to accomplish the goals of the project, the numerical                  model already developec (Sahagian, 1985; in press) will be                      refined to provide greater accuracy and sensitivity of vesicle                  size distribution to atmospheric pressure.  Modern field samples                will be collected to calibrate the sensitivity of th model and                  laboratory technique.  In Phase II, ancient samples will be                     collected to provide the first paleo-atmospheric pressure data.",
