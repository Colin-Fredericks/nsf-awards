 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Dr. David S. Hinds of California State University at                            Bakersfield and Dr. R. V. Baudinette of The Flinders                            University of South Australia.  This research is to                             measure maximum metabolism, as well as the ratio of                             maximum to minimum metabolism in marsupial species                              during treadmill locomotion and exposure to cold.  The                          results will be compared with data from placental                               mammals.  The research tests the hypothesis that maximum                        metabolism during locomotion in placental mammals will                          be elevated above that in response to cold, but not to                          the extent observed in marsupials.  The findings will                           provide insight into the maximum performance abilities of                       mammals generally regarded as the most evolutionarily                           conservators of living mammals and exhibiting many of the                       attributes of ancestral mammals.                                                                                                                                The project continues the excellent and productive                              collaboration between the Australian group and its                              interest in thermoregulation in marsupials and the Hinds                        work on metabolism in birds, monotremes, marsupials, and                        eutherians.  This is important fundamental work on the                          absorption of heat and cold by mammals, as well as                              having potential for major advances in comparative                              physiology and evolution.",
