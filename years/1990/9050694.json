 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hope College is adding mechanical testing apparatus to enable the               introduction of mechanical testing laboratories into an engineering             physics program at a liberal arts college.  With this equipment,                students are able to investigate experimentally the materials and               mechanical members which they have designed and have analysed by                computer methods.  Besides gaining a better understanding of                    mechanical systems the students learn the capabilities and                      limitations of computer models through comparison of theory with                experiment.  Four courses are directly enhanced through the                     introduction of these laboratories.  The engineering physics                    program at Hope College is designed to prepare students interested              in engineering and applied physics for direct enrollment in                     graduate school.  The college is matching the grant with an equal               amount.//",
