 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study Guild will investigate and seek to demonstrate a                  proprietary noncryogenic system to produce high-purity oxygen.                  Such a system offers the potential for not only on-site                         generation of high-purity oxygen at the user location, but                      large scale production of oxygen as a substitute for cryogenic                  methods.  This will be the first practical process capable of                   producing oxygen at 99.5% purity by means other than cryogenic                  distillation.  The concept offers users of oxygen a simple and                  lowcost alternative to the logistical encumberances of present                  methods.  It may also offer manufacturers a more economical                     method of producing oxygen on a large scale.                                                                                                                    High-purity oxygen is used extensively in industrial, medical                   and military applications.  In industry, its primary use is as                  a reagent in chemical synthesis.  In the medical field and for                  the military it is used primarily as breathing oxygen.  High-                   purity oxygen is commercially manufactured by cryogenic                         technoiques.  These techniques are very complex, and involve                    reducing the temperature of air low enough to liquify the                       oxygen and nitrogen and facilitate their separation in a                        distillation column.  The product oxygen is supplied as liquid                  in bulk quantities or as bottled gas.  Chemical production                      plants, hospitals and military bases which rely on high-purity                  oxygen must all have extensive and costly facilities for                        storing and handling tanked liquid oxygen or bottled gaseous                    oxygen.  Furthermore, they are reliant on an outside source to                  provide them with the product which is, therefore, subject to                   uncertainties with supply and price.",
