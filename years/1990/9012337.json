 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Near East has long served as a focus for archaeological                     investigation, because its prehistory documents two of the major                \"revolutions\" in human development.  At a time just prior to                    10,000 years ago small hunting and gathering bands began to                     develop a settled way of life.  Group size increased, ceramic                   vessels were first manufactured, and the gradual domestication of               both wild plants such as wheat and barley and animals such as                   goats and sheep occurred.  At a later time period, social units                 grew larger and became organized on a hierarchical basis.                       Temples and large public buildings were constructed, and the                    hallmarks of \"civilization\" such as writing emerged.  In their                  speculations on how and why this process occurred, archaeologists               have realized that human societies interact closely with and are                influenced by the natural environment, and it has been implicitly               assumed that environmental change played a role.  However, just                 how the environment changed over time and how populations were                  affected is unclear.                                                                                                                                            Dr. Frank Hole and his colleagues will conduct research to                      address this issue.  The team is experienced in collaborative,                  multi-disciplinary field and laboratory research and will acquire               data to assess environmental change over time.  They will conduct               field studies of the geomorphology and vegetation of the Khabur                 drainage of northeastern Syria and establish a regional                         environmental context for interpretation.  They will also sample                sections from prior archaeological excavations to obtain data                   pertinent to local environments and economic adaptations across                 the time sequence.  Because of extensive salvage archaeology in                 this region, many sites of known age which contain relevant data                are available.  These settlements will yield both environmental                 and economic information.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                new insight into the processes which underlie the development of                complex society.  It will also yield information on long-term                   human-environment interactions in a ecologically sensitive part                 of the world.",
