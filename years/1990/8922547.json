 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biostratigraphy and oxygen-isotope stratigraphy are of more                     limit use for dating Arctic Ocean sediments from other                          regions because of the relative scarcity of suitable fossil                     material.  The existing chronostratigraphic framework for                       these sediments is based primarily on a combination of                          lithostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy and is of limited                     resolution.  This award supports the construction of a                          significantly higher-resolution chronostratigraphic                             framework for abyssal Arctic Ocean sediments using an                           approach that is based primarily on rock-magnetic and                           polarity stratigraphy.  Data indicate that                                      paleoenvironmental changes in the Milankovitch frequency                        band are recorded by rock-magnetic parameters.  Therefore, a                    combination of rock-magnetic, paleomagnetic, and other                          studies (i.e., lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and                          isotope stratigraphy) can provide both a high-resolution                        stratigraphic framework and a data base for                                     paleoenvironmental interferences.  Preliminary results from                     several sediment cores from different regions of the Arctic                     indicate that this approach is feasible.  Study material                        includes a total of 15 sediment cores collected from the T-3                    ice island (4 cores), from ice station Alpha by the                             Coordinated Eastern Arctic Experiment (CESAR) expedition (3                     cores), from the Eurasian Basin Ark IV expedition (4 cores),                    and the Northwind Ridge (4 cores).",
