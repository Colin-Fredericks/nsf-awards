It is                being funded under the Instrumentation and Laboratory                           Improvement (ILI) Program, which has the goal of improving the                  quality of the undergraduate curriculum by supporting projects to               develop new or improved instrument-based undergraduate laboratory               and/or field courses in science, mathematics, or engineering.  In               particular, the calculus program will use (1) a small number of                 prototype problem areas to motivate the introduction of                         mathematical concepts, (2) an exploration-based computer                        laboratory, and (3) writing assignments.  The mode of the                       computer laboratory experiments will be discovery learning                      through guided exploration; the laboratory will allow students to               explore the questions inherent in modeling real-world problems                  and to develop intuition for the properties of functions of one                 and several variables.  Written reports on these laboratory                     experiences will constitute a major portion of the writing                      assignments in the course.",
