 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fractal geometery permits the description of many complex                  natural phenomena using a few relatively simple equations.  At                  least three methods to generate fractal models have been                        developed to the degree that they can be applied to biological                  questions of ecological significance:  fractal set theory,                      iterated function systems (IFS), and Lindenmayer systems (L-                    systems).  Plant roots, fungi and soil pore spaces all have                     fractal properties; hence fractal methods appear to be suitable                 for the study of interactions between plant roots, the soil and                 soil microorganisms.  The aim of the proposed research it to                    develop methods for modelling these interactions, to facilitate                 research into the plant root-soil ecosystem.  Work in progress at               the P.I.'s  laboratory has shown the common species of soil fungi               have patterns of mycelial branching that are fractal, and that                  these patterns can be modelled for up to 5 days after spore                     germination using L-systems.  L-systems appear to work equally                  well for geometrically simple root systems, such as those of pea.               These methods will be extended to other systems, and methods for                modelling of the interaction between roots and soil                             microorganisms that are based on fractal representation will be                 developed.  The methods will be tested by comparing them to                     laboratory measurements of fungus-root interactions.  These type                on interactions are broadly important in virtually all                          terrestrial environments, including many endangered habitats.",
