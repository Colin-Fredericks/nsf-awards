 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some invertebrates have complex eyes that provide novel insights                beyond what has been discovered about visual processing in the                  vertebrate eye.  One group of crustaceans called stomatopods, or                mantis shrimp, have large compound eyes, and social and predatory               behaviors that depend on sophisticated visual processing of form,               motion, and color.  The eye contains three bands of facets                      providing overlapping fields of view that may aid in directing                  the predatory strike.  Some species' eyes have ten or more visual               channels for spectral sensitivity and polarized light detection.                These animals include a diversity of species occupying tropical                 marine habitats; some occupy coastal areas where color vision in                daylight is practical, while others are in deeper or murkier                    water, or are nocturnal.  Each species has its own pattern of                   body coloration, ocular anatomy and retinal physiology.                         This work will examine the visual system in the context of the                  behaving animals in their environment, to try to extract how                    these visual systems are optimized for high performance.                        Techniques of spectrophotometry, histology, chromatography,                     radiometry, and ethology will be used to characterize visual                    pigments, intraocular filters, body coloration, photic                          environments, and the ability of the animals to discriminate                    hues.  Results should clarify how stomatopod vision is                          specialized for behavior in diverse habitats.  This unusually                   multifaceted approach on the mechanisms of a well-defined                       biological system in its environment should have impact on                      visual science, sensory neurobiology, ethology, and zoology, and                might be very interesting to workers on machine vision.",
