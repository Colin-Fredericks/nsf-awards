 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Science Instruction and Study (ISIS) will                     associate experienced science teachers from Connecticut                         (including minority teachers and teachers of minorities) with                   research scientists who are working at the frontiers of                         knowledge in their fields.  Seminars, weekend workshops,                        field site visits, summer programs, and mentorships will                        introduce the teachers to every aspect of the scientific                        research process.  Since the teachers will be intimately                        involved in ongoing scientific work, they will be identified                    as ISIS Fellows.  Through ISIS, Fellows will learn to                           interact with the scientific community personally and                           intellectually.  By experiencing real and recent science,                       teacher participants will be scientifically remotivated to                      acquire an enriched knowledge of science, technology, and                       social values.  Through the sharing of experiences with other                   ISIS Fellows, and interaction with participating scientists,                    they will become more skilled and dynamic in their teaching.                    The result will be teachers with renewed self-images and                        increased levels of confidence in their science-related                         abilities.  ISIS Fellows will form a cadre of scientifically-                   informed teachers who will become leaders in their school                       districts.  Their ability to provide leadership will be                         enhanced by the guarantee of support from their school                          administration and continued access to ISIS resources.                                                                                                          An amount equivalent to 42.6% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
