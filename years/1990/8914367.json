 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for production of archival                     quality copies of the negatives of a portion of the Field Museum                of Natural History's Botanical Type Photograph Collection.  The                 photographic negatives record the \"type specimen\" -- the                        individual plant representing a genus or species that most                      closely exemplifies the essential characteristics that taxon.                   Many of these negatives are in advanced stages of deterioration,                and they need to be copied to state-of-the-art safety film.                     Among them are the threatened negatives of the type plant                       specimens once held in the Berlin-Dahlem Museum, which was mostly               destroyed in the Allied bombing of Berlin in World War II.  The                 negative collection was originated in 1929 by American scientist                J. Francis Macbride, who traveled to Europe to photograph type                  specimens of tropical American plants preserved in major European               herbaria.  His goal was to make this information available to                   American botanists unable to travel.                                                 In many cases, the Berlin negatives are the only visual                    remains of the type specimens that were destroyed.  These visual                records are often essential in characterizing the described                     taxon; they provide information critical to the proper                          recognition, typification, and understanding of species in many                 families.  For some species, the only known specimen is recorded                among Field Museum's type photographs.  The proposed restoration                effort will allow future generations of botanists to verify the                 identities of hundreds of tropical plants, and to study species                 that have become extinct.",
