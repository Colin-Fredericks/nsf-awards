 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the mechanical engineering and technology                 materials science and failure analysis laboratories.  These                     laboratories are intended to improve the understanding of the                   fundamentals of materials science and to promote the applications of            materials so as to minimize failure and maximize performance.                   Graduates of this program will meet industries' need for engineers who          can design and produce high quality goods more efficiently.  New                courses are being developed and laboratories integrated into these as           well as existing areas.  The acquired equipment permits the inclusion           of materials specifications, fatigue and fracture analysis.  The                addition of the Materials Testing System permits a major upgrade of the         current curriculum.  The acquisition of this state-of-the-art                   instrument allows students to become familiar with all essential tech-          niques needed to design and analyze ways to prevent failures in machine         parts.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                  principal investigator's institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  //",
