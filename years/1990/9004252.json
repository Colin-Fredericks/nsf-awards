 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research has two primary goals:  1. to compare rigorously                  eight different techniques used for determining the exposure-ages               of geomorphic surfaces;  2. to understand the timing of alluvial                fan aggradation on the bajada below the eastern Sierra Nevada.                  During the first year of the project, cores will be collected from              boulders on a chronologic sequence of five geomorphic surfaces for              which exposure-ages are constrained by previous geologic                        investigation.  For each boulder and surface, model exposure-ages               will be calculated from the measured accumulation of different                  cosmogenic isotopes produced in situ including 3He, 10Be, 36Cl, and             in some cases 26Al and 14C.  After comparing the ages obtained from             isotopic methods with existing ages estimates, varnish cation-ratio             and radiocarbon ages, and 10Be accumulation in soils, the most                  appropriate system(s) for determining the temporal and spatial                  distribution of alluvial fan aggradation will be chosen, also,                  there will be an intensive study of two drainages in the eastern                Sierra Nevada, one glaciated, the other unglaciated.  To determine              if glaciation and fan aggradation were synchronous, the abundance               of cosmogenic isotopes and calculate model exposure-ages for                    samples taken from boulders on fan surfaces and glacial moraines                will be obtained.  Age-data gathered in the second year of this                 study will provide a direct and important link between the marine               isotope and terrestrial records of climate change.  Because of the              inter-disciplinary project team and because this investigation is               part of a larger, coordinated University of Washington effort to                understand the genesis, chronology, and response to climate change              of Sierra Nevada alluvial fans, this project represents a unique                opportunity for advancement in the fields of geomorphology and                  Quaternary geochronology.",
