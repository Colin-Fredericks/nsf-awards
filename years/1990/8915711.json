 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ambitious proposal to investigate new approaches to                  analyzing and interpreting data on risk perception.  Fifteen years              of empirical research on perceptions of risk have led to a number               of useful insights and conclusions.  However, most of this research             has used a rather narrow set of analytic methods for data analysis.             This project proposes to apply powerful but rarely used analytic                methods to five existing sets of data on perceived risk.  Such                  analyses should provide new insights into individual differences                in risk perception, changes in perceptions over time, and taxonomic             representations of hazards and perceptions.  In addition, explicit              theories of risk perception will be developed and tested with these             new methods.                                                                                                                                                    The principal investigators are recognized leaders in the field of              risk perception and risk communication.  They have been highly                  productive in their past research efforts and are ideally situated              to conduct the proposed research.  The approach is technically                  sound with a high potential for contributing both to risk analysis              and to behavioral decision theory.",
