 "awd_abstract_narration": "For nearly thirty years, research has proceeded at Castle                  Lake, California.  Throughout this period, a strict protocol of                 monitoring of physical and chemical conditions and plankton                     dynamics has been maintained, producing an extensive long-germ                  data set that has recently been analyzing using statistical                     techniques of time-series and multivariate analysis.  These                     studies have led to major insights into the processes which                     contribute to ecological variability in this system.                            Variability in system behavior in Castle Lake has been                          successfully decomposed into components which arise from external               processes, such as unusual climatic conditions like El Nino, and                those associated with internal, predatory interactions (effects                 induced by coupled predatory interactions from fish to                          zooplankton to phytoplankton).  In this proposal, a long-term                   approach which will allow a better understanding and the                        distinguishing of the ways in which these processes occur and                   interact in Castle Lake is outlined.  This proposal is centered                 around a cycle of whole-lake manipulations of predatory                         interactions, involving alteration of the stocking regime of the                dominant planktivore in the lake, rainbow trout.  Coupled with                  this manipulation and monitoring of Castle Lake, a second lake                  (Cliff Lake) to serve as a \"reference\" system during the initial                years of the project will be monitored and manipulated in a                     reciprocal fashion in future years.  The cycle of manipulations                 is to be completed within the 5 years of this award, after which                it is planned to repeat the cycle of manipulations to test the                  repeatability of system responses to food web manipulation in                   years of contrasting climatic conditions.  The second component                 of the program is designed to improve the understanding of how                  strong climatic signals enter the Castle Lake system during the                 crucial spring period of ice-melt, hydraulic loading, and                       establishment of thermal stratification.  In each year of the                   study, an intensive series of measures of physical, chemical, and               biological conditions beginning with the break-up of the ice                    cover will be conducted.  By contrasting the physical and                       chemical conditions during spring in years which differ in                      climatic severity, greater insights into the mechanisms by which                climatic variation contributes so strongly to interannual                       variability in this system should be obtained.",
