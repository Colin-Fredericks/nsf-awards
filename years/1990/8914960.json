 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mysteries of motion inside living cells must be                             investigated from both biochemical and biophysical                              perspectives.  The molecular apparatus of cytoplasmic motility                  includes scores of proteins that have evolved for specialized                   functions in the complex process of intracellular force                         generation.  Many of these proteins have now been isolated and                  characterized both chemically and functionally; but the                         interplay among them to create supramolecular structures and                    to generate intracellular motive forces is still a matter of                    more speculation than understanding.  Even the most fundamental                 issues about macromolecular self-assembly and supramolecular                    hydrodynamics remain to be resolved.  The broad objective of                    Dr. Ware's work in this field is to utilize the techniques of                   macromolecular physical chemistry to provide quantitation of                    mechanistically significant observables.                                                                                                                        The primary component of the motile apparatus is actin, the                     most abundant and most highly conserved protein in nature.  The                 mechanism of actin self-assembly and its regulations will be                    investigated using the fluorescence photobleaching recovery                     technique and other methods including fluorescence                              spectroscopy, viscosimetry, and light scattering.  Specific                     issues to be addressed include the role of cations in promoting                 assembly and the role of ATP hydrolysis in determining kinetic                  and thermodynamics parameters.  Particular emphasis will be                     placed on the determination of filament length and filament                     number using multiple physical techniques, including                            fluorescence recovery after photobleaching quasi-elastic light                  scattering and viscosimetry.  Similar experiments will be                       employed to examine the mechanisms of action of proteins that                   have regulatory function on actin assembly and filament length.                 The results of these experiments and related physical                           investigations on model systems will be interpreted with the                    goal of providing objective physical tests for proposed                         mechanisms of regulated actin assembly, cytoplasmic rheology,                   and cytoplasmic motility.",
