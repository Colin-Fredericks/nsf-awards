 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clonal growth is a common reproductive strategy among                      sessile marine invertebrates.  Although the pervasiveness of this               strategy implies success, the relative contribution of asexual                  versus sexual reproduction to long term population dynamics in                  invertebrates has rarely been quantified.  This fellowship                      research will pursue the use of molecular genetic techniques to                 determine the genetic diversity and population structure of the                 clonal gorgonian, Plexaura sp.  Differentiation of genotypes will               be attempted using DNA fingerprinting to characterize the clonal                structure of the population.  These data on population structure                will be used to deduce the long term effects of clonal                          reproduction on the population.  The relatedness of different                   populations and species will be measured by examining DNA                       sequence variation and restriction fragment length polymorphisms                of mitochondrial DNA.                                                                The adaptation of these techniques for use with gorgonians                 will allow the quantification of the relative importance of                     sexual and asexual reproduction; the extent of larval dispersal                 between reefs and populations; the relationship between                         phenotypic and genotypic variation; and the systematics of the                  genus.  The training in molecular genetic techniques will provide               Dr. Coffroth with the ability to apply these techniques to other                marine systems and other questions in biological oceanography.",
