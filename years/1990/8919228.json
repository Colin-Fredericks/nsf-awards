 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research on the influence of leaf surface                     wetness on photosynthetic CO2 exchange and transpirational water                loss will provide a ground-breaking study of a widespread                       phenomenon in nature.  Because a water-film will curtail CO2                    uptake dramatically, terrestrial plants must repel water from                   leaf surfaces.  This is despite the frequent occurrence of                      natural leaf wetting events such as rain, dewfall, ground fog,                  cloudmist and spray deposition.  Preliminary  evidence suggests                 that leaves of numerous species have evolved extreme water-                     repelling characteristics to prevent stomatal pores from being                  covered with a water film. This water-repelling capability                      appears to have co-evolved with structural and orientation                      features that interact to strongly influence water retention.  In               some cases, a high water repellency in the form of water bead                   formation coincides with a high retention.  This combination may                result in water use efficiencies much higher than previously                    reported, as will as enhanced CO2 uptake due to higher humidity                 and, thus, greater stomatal opening.                                                 The above results for native plant species may also have                   substantial applied significance for production in agricultural                 species.  For example, the common practice of spray irrigation                  during midday to prevent stomatal closure may only be effective                 for species with non-wettable leaf surfaces.  The specific                      effects of spray-type irrigation on CO2 uptake and yields has                   not been investigated for crop species.  A more fundamental                     understanding of leaf wetness effects on CO2 exchange in native                 plants, and corresponding adaptations could lead to a more                      strategic system of matching irrigation systems to species-                     specific traits for leaf water-repellency, or artificial                        selection for certain leaf traits that could enhance water use                  efficiency as well as carbon gain.                                              **//",
