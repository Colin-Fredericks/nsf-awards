 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies various configurations of shared busses in a               Multistage Interconnection Network (MIN) based system in order to               maintain cache coherence.  These busses can be put separately or inside         the MIN switches.  It is also possible to avoid using shared busses by          redesigning a MIN switch to handle broadcasting.  The design and                analysis of these cache coherence protocols are the research objectives         of this project.  A thorough analysis and comparison of various                 approaches can guide the future multiprocessor system designers in their        design process.                                                                                                                                                 Multiprocessor organizations are generally defined based on their               processor memory interconnections.  MINs form a very suitable                   interconnection medium for building large scale multiprocessor systems.         The efficiency of these systems can be further enhanced by putting cache        memories with the processors to reduce the memory access demands.               However, such cache memories give rise to inconsistency of shared data          due to lack of coordination among the processors while changing their           shared cache contents.  A hardware solution to this problem is to               broadcast the state changes through a shared bus interconnection.  Since        MINs do not have a shared bus, maintaining cache coherence in MIN based         multiprocessors poses a serious challenge for research.",
