 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a novel non-intrusive                 surface temperature measurement technique for the in-                           situdetermination of both temperature and emissivity.  The                      technique employs small local modulation of the temperature of                  the surface to be measured and detection of the modulated                       surface radiation.  By modulating the surface radiation,                        extraneous radiation from other surrounding bodies is                           excluded, and the spectral shape of the modulated radiation is                  a function of surface temperature.  The objective of the                        project is to demonstrate the technique at temperatures in the                  range of 1700 K.  The approach will be primarily experimental                   and will involve the construction of a test system, and                         comparison of the results obtained from this technique with                     those of conventional techniques.                                                                                                                               The successful application of this device would be useful in                    monitoring industrial processes, boiler operation, diagnostics                  in gas turbines, jet engines, and rockets, and various control                  applications.",
