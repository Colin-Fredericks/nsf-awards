 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the efficient and accurate numerical                solution of inverse problems by means of the construction of                    improved potential functions and the application of wavelets.                   In an inverse problem one tries to reconstruct an equation from                 information about its solutions, and this leads to difficult                    problems in numerical linear algebra, since for a large system                  the reconstruction must be done on a computer.                                       It may seem strange but very often one has solutions to a                  problem without knowing exactly what the problem is itself.                     Think of the case where your doctor takes X-rays of you during an               examination in order to find out if anything is amiss.  The data                from the X-rays are essentially like the solutions, whereas the                 problem in this case might be an unknown malady.  Your doctor                   tries to determine what particular condition \u0131equation! is                      producing the data \u0131solutions!. In much the same spirit the                     principal investigator will study numerical techniques for                      determining the equations that are producing certain types of                   solutions.",
