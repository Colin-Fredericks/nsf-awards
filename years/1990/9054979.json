 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop brings together representatives of undergraduate                  Bioengineering curricula and others who have an interest and concern            with the quality of such undergraduate programs.  The workshop is a             2.5 day event meeting an important need to discuss common problems,             identify future directions and study possible avenues to                        significantly improve these programs. Participants in this workshop             will attend the first national meeting of this type since the first             undergraduate program was accredited in 1972.  The steering                     committee, consisting of four experienced Bioengineering Department             Heads, are directing sessions aimed at the curricula, the student,              curricula resources and networking. As a result of this workshop,               all bioengineering departments in this country will receive a copy              of the report with recommendations for action and responsible                   agencies or individuals.  Participants will contribute about 32% of             the award toward the operation of this project.",
