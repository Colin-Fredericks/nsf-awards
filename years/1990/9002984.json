 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluorescence polarization and energy transfer is used to probe                  the conformational dynamics of two light-activated proteins,                    rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin.  Over the years, these                         proteins have provided important model systems for receptor                     action and ion transport, respectively.  The goal of the                        present study is to investigate changes in protein flexibility                  as a result of conformational transitions.  These systems are                   especially convenient for this purpose because of the ease of                   inducing transitions with light.  These experiments should                      provide unique information on how protein dynamics influence                    conformational transitions.  Phase lifetime spectroscopy is                     used to measure changes in fluorescence energy transfer and                     fluorescence polarization in bacteriorhodopsin as it proceeds                   through its proton-pumping photocycle.  This novel technique                    will allow changes in position of the chromophore, retinal, to                  be monitored for intermediates which exist on the millisecond                   time scale.  In the rhodopsin work, fluorescence labels are                     attached to a site located on the carboxyl tail which is                        thought to anchor the tail to the membrane.  The membrane                       location of the this site will be established using                             fluorescence energy transfer.  Fluorescence anisotropy                          measurements will be used to characterize the motion of the                     \"tethered tail\".  Finally, theoretical models will be                           investigated to provide link between molecular dynamics and                     conformational changes.",
