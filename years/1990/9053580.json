 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Mexico State University will conduct a four-year program to improve         secondary school teaching and learning of mathematics through student           \"research\" projects.  The concept, which has been developed and                 successfully tested at New Mexico State by the project staff, will be           transported to secondary schools and tested via this teacher enhancement        program.  In line with the NCTM Curriculum Standards and with principles        underlying calculus reform, the idea is to transfer the emphasis from           teaching by transmitting information to learning by hands-on problem-           solving work.  The program activities will focus on the posing and              solving                                                                         of substantial problems that form the basis of project-oriented                 learning,                                                                       and on cooperative learning strategies.  All three Las Cruces public            schools will participate in this project, with 28 teachers as                   participants.                                                                   The evaluation component has a unique characteristic in that a high             percentage of the Las Cruces high school graduates who continue on to           higher education do so at New Mexico State University.  For this reason,        the progress of a substantial number of students can be monitored and           assessed during the life of the grant.  The project staff has produced          materials for over 100 undergraduate student research projects and,             together with the participants, the staff will produce 100 for teacher          enhancement under this grant.  A leadership component is included to            achieve a multiplier effect.  New Mexico State University and the Las           Cruces Public Schools have contributed an amount equal to 47% of the            National Science Foundation request.",
