 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in geography and related sciences has focused attention           on gender-related segregation of space within cities.  One profitable           line of inquiry has been the study of the geography of women -- where           they work, how they travel, how they function within employment,                commercial, and social settings.  Another line of inquiry has observed          how gender relationships affect social structures.  Much of this                research has assumed high degrees of homogeneity among females and              males, however.  This Research Opportunities for Women Planning Grant           will support an effort to refine a research plan that will attempt to           identify differences in geographic and employment behavior among                different types of women.  A case study in New York City will be                developed to test hypotheses that the use of urban spaces by women is           determined both by their positions in the labor market and by the               structures of their households.  This planning project will consist of          the analysis of women's positions in the labor market as documented in          1980 census data and development and testing of a survey instrument.            Because a major focus of the research will be to differentiate between          the experiences of recent immigrants versus women who have resided in           New York for longer periods, the survey will be administered in Chinese         and Spanish as well as in English.                                                   This project will help solidify the research design of a larger            project that will contribute considerably to our understandings of the          different ways that different women operate in modern cities.  This             type of research will enhance our knowledge of the role of gender in            society, and it will broaden our appreciation of the complex ways that          economic and social activities function.  The project also will provide         a superb opportunity for a young female scholar with an excellent               background to further improve her basic research skills.",
