 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will initiate a hands-on inquiry-based science                     curriculum in all the elementary school classrooms of the                       Pasadena Unified School District.  The District is urban,                       multicultural and multiracial.  The District's partner, the                     California Institute of Technology (Caltech), is a preeminent                   research university.  Their combined effort will use a method                   proven during four years of a very successful partnership                       between Caltech and one Pasadena pilot school.  The initial                     education for teachers will be presented in small groups each                   led by a mentor teacher and a volunteer science professional.                   During these group meetings the teachers will have an                           opportunity to investigate kit materials which they will use                    later in their classrooms.  The small group will work through                   the kits in a cooperative learning environment, while the co-                   leaders emphasize the philosophy and methods of hands-on                        teaching as well as the scientific subject matter which                         relates to each kit.  During the school year, resource                          teachers will work with teachers in their classrooms, and                       meet with them during group meetings.  At these sessions                        teachers will be able to explore other science units and                        exchange experiences and ideas with their colleagues.                           The total cost sharing for the project will be 200% of the                      NSF portion.",
