 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences will extend for two more years                 the Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable (GUIRR).                 Initiated as an experiment six years ago, the Roundtable is now                 recognized as an established, unique organization in national                   science and technology policy affairs.  Federal agencies, state                 governments, universities, and industry all look to the                         Roundtable as the only forum in the United States that brings                   together the leaders of all sectors of the research enterprise on               an ongoing basis and in a manner that injects imaginative thought               into the policy process and more effective procedures into the                  nation's research system.                                                                                                                                       The focus of the Roundtable continues to be on the three areas                  that have been the core of the Roundtable agenda since it was                   established:                                                                                                                                                         1)   the academic science and engineering research                                   enterprise--its organizational arrangements, physical                           infrastructure, and support mechanisms;                                                                                                                    2)   new alliances between universities and other sectors                            and between federal and state governments--their                                contributions to academic research and teaching and to                          the processes of technical change and innovation in                             industry, and the difficult policy issues that arise as                         a result of the increased interactions; and                                                                                                                3)   the identification, recruitment, and retention of                               science and engineering talent.                                                                                                                       A new proposed initiative, a comprehensive look at the                          management of the overall R&D enterprise, is a logical extension                of the work in these three areas.  This agenda is the result of                 extensive discussions within the working groups and the                         Roundtable Council over the past year, together with input from                 the relevant constituency groups, and is based on the                           accomplishments of current activities.  In addition, the                        Roundtable will respond to issues vital to science and                          engineering that emerge in the policy environment.                                                                                                              The topics addressed by the NAS Government-University-Industry                  Research Roundtable have direct relevance to NSF planning and                   evaluation activities.",
