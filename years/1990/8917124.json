 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accretionary prisms form at convergent margins where one                        lithospheric plate is underthrusting an adjacent lithospheric                   plate and sediments are being scraped off the downgoing plate.                  These offscraped sediments form a large pile (accretionary prism)               in front of the overriding plate with thickness of 10 to 20 kms.                This thick wedge of sediments consolidates by dewatering; the                   details of this consolidation process are poorly understood but                 are known to involve heat and fluid transport within the prism as               well as deformation of the sediments and rock that form the                     prism.  Professor Wang will generate a computer finite element                  model of the accretionary prism on the Oregon-Washington margin                 integrating hydrogeological, thermal, and consolidation                         processes.  A finite element model created previously under                     OCE86-05986 did not integrate hydrogeological and thermal aspects               in that computations for hydrological, thermal, and deformational               processes were performed sequentially for any given time step.                  Wang proposes now to fully couple the computations in that all                  relevant variables will be solved for simultaneously - closer to                the natural process.  He proposes to use the wealth of thermal,                 seismic, physical properties, and fluid flow measurements                       available from the Oregon margin as boundary conditions on his                  models.",
