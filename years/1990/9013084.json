 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a                                    probabilistic approach to short-term                                            forecasting of electric load demand.  The                                       proposed approach accounts explicitly for                                       weather and lifestyle influences.  The single                                   customer load demand is decomposed into two                                     components:  stochastic and periodic.  The                                      stochastic components (heating/cooling and                                      water heater) are modeled via stochastic                                        differential equations.  Semi-Markov theory is                                  used to determine the load of these                                             components.  The periodic part (the remaining                                   part of the load, excluding the stochastic                                      components) is determined using time series                                     methods.  The second phase of this research is                                  to identify the parameters of the models of                                     the different components.  A validation of the                                  proposed approach will also be performed.  The                                  second phase will use the data gathered during                                  the Department of Energy experimental project                                   on distribution automation and control at                                       Athens Utilities in Tennessee.  Since the                                       basic building block of the proposed approach                                   is the forecast at the single customer level,                                   the accuracy of the forecast of the aggregated                                  model is enhanced.  The results of these                                        investigations will provide the utilities with                                  a more accurate technique for short-term load                                   forecast at any desired level of the system.                                    The availability of an accurate forecast will                                   enable the utilities to make more confident                                     decisions of operation and planning.",
