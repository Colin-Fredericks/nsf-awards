 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This grant provides support for a joint                            research by a U.S. team headed by Dr. John W. Leibacher of                      the National Solar Observatory (NSO) in Tucson, AZ, and an                      Indian team headed by Dr. A. Bhatnagar, Director of the                         Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) in Udaipur, India.  The                         research, in its first phase, will cover site evaluation of                     Udaipur as one of six sites for the Global Oscillation                          Network Group (GONG) project.  The GONG project seeks to                        obtain information through observations, made at different                      sites on the surface of the earth, of the oscillations at                       the surface of the sun, the earth's nearest star.                               Helioseismology, the study of these solar oscillations, has                     been developed as a new powerful tool that can probe the                        solar interior with considerable precision much in the same                     way that terrestial seismology reveals information about the                    interior of the earth.  Because the instruments and the                         program of observation to be used during the second phase                       are quite sensitive and complicated, it is important to run                     certain evaluative experiments on the various sites under                       consideration around the globe, including the Udaipur site,                     before making the final selection of the six sites.                                                                                                             Scope:  Indian scientists have contributed significantly to                     the field of solar physics.  The USO has a unique                               geographical location being in an area of considerable                          atmospheric clarity and at approximately opposite position                      around the globe to the NSO in Tucson.  The support of the                      Government of India (GOI) will be crucial for the success of                    the experiments.  This grant will enable the U.S. team to                       conduct the necessary preliminary tests and to negotiate                        with the GOI the required facilities from different                             governmental agencies.
