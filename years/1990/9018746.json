 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the University of Michigan project is to recruit, mentor            and graduate African Americans, and women with Ph.D. degrees in                 engineering who can go on to become faculty members and role models for         others.  Students will be recruited through individual interviews from          a number of small but distinguished regional schools and historically           black Colleges.  Career plans, desire to succeed and help others, and           academic credentials will be the main selection criteria.  After                selection the seven GEE project students will go through a week long            orientation program to sharpen the success skills such as time                  management, study habits, familiarity with the university, as well as           identifying the academic shortcomings in their backgrounds for remedial         course work as needed.  Each student will have a faculty mentor and role        model who will work closely with the student throughout the Ph.D.               program.  The Gee project will be used as a catalyst to refine                  recruiting and retention methods for underrepresented groups.",
