 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this proposal is to begin the development of a                      set of three courses in natural science and technology which                    emphasize developing scientific literacy in an environment in                   which good teaching is modeled.  Each course is to be                           accompanied by a one credit seminar on methods of teaching                      science/technology.  These courses/seminar combinations are                     to be taught both to undergraduates teacher preparation                         students and to the teachers with whom the teacher education                    majors will do their field experience and student teaching.                     One major theme of the university course development is                         identifying and accommodating science anxious learners.  This                   project, in particular, will develop the first course/seminar                   pair and conduct the first summer workshop for the                              experienced teachers that will work with the students.  In                      addition, the project will hold a small conference exploring                    the adaptability of the planned courses and seminars at other                   small liberal arts universities that educate teachers.  The                     products of the project will include 8-10 laboratory guides                     for preservice teachers as well as a detailed course syllabus                   and seminar syllabus.  Student materials will include guides                    for short projects for use in the seminar and a set of                          readings for both the course and the seminar.                                                                                                                   Capital University is contributing 85% of the amount that NSF                   is contributing to the project.",
