 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his research group are starting a                          program to develop more sophisticated models of premixed                        turbulent combustion, in which the interactions between                         the fast chemical reactions typical of combustion and the                       fluctuations in density, concentration, and temperature                         that accompany turbulence are addressed in more detail.                         These interactions appear as integrals along the flame                          surface separating the hot product gases from the cold                          reactant gases.  The major difficulty in approximating                          these integrals is that distortion of the flame surface by                      turbulence at all scales is relevant and ultimately                             impacts on the rate of reaction in the flame.                                   Experimental information about the interactions is                              required to develop a more thorough understanding of the                        fundamental processes at work in the flame brush.  The                          investigator proposes to study these processes using                            numerical simulations of a hypothetical flame sheet                             passing through homogeneous turbulence, as an                                   experimental tool.  The most important limitation of                            simulations is the relatively modest Reynolds numbers that                      are achievable, due to constraints of computational speed                       and storage.  However, for simple flow systems they have                        shown that they can accurately represent turbulence over a                      range of scales that is sufficient for the purposes of                          this proposal.  The MRI planning grant is intended to fund                      preliminary studies that will allow to 1) develop the                           capability to simulate turbulent flames, and 2) develop                         tools to interpret the results of those simulations to                          improve the overall modeling effort.",
