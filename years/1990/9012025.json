 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cardiovascular disorders, such as hypertension, afflicts                   approximately 20% of the adult population, and is the prime cause               of congestive heart failure, stroke and renal diseased.  The                    understanding of the development of hypertension is most adults                 remains obscure but the research has centered mainly around                     measurements of hormones within the blood stream.  Angiotensin II               is a neuropeptide hormone that elicits a reproducible complex of                behavioral, cardiovascular, neurologic and endocrine responses                  when injected into the brain.  Given its major influence on the                 regulation of blood pressure, it has been suggested that abnormal               regulation of angiotensin II in the brain might be etiologic in                 the development of hypertensin.  Dr. Kalinyak will examine the                  sight of synthesis of this peptide and determine its effects on                 neuronal activity.  Her preliminary data indicate that non-                     neuronal cells of the brain, the glial cells, produce the                       angiotensin II and the research planning grant will allow to                    explore this possibility using cell culture systems.  This work                 will help clarify the function of neuropeptides in glial cells                  and neurons.  Moreover, it could lead to a better understanding                 of the importance of brain angiotensin in the development of                    hypertension in adults.",
