 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because of its geographic and oceanographic setting, the Gulf of                California records a mix of oceanwide and regional oceanographic                and climatic signals.  The extremely high rates of sedimentation                and frequent occurrence of annual laminae (varves) make the Gulf                an ideal location for carrying out high resolution studies of                   paleoenvironmental change on the seasonal to millenial (and                     greater) scale.                                                                                                                                                 Despite the long interest in Gulf varves, this will be the first                project to use sediment traps to directly determine the process                 of varve formation.  The results will lead to a better                          understanding of how the climatic/oceanographic record is                       preserved, which will be used in the recover glacial as well as                 interglacial sediments.                                                                                                                                         Following hypotheses will be tested:  1) that varve formation                   results from the seasonal input of wind-blown terrigenous                       material, 2) that the seasonal timing of light and dark laminae                 formation differs between the eastern and western sides of the                  Gulf, 3) that the deposition of nonlaminated sediment during                    glacial and Younger Dryas time resulted from increased oxygen and               decreased nutrient content of intermediate depth waters in the                  Pacific Ocean, and 4) that deglacial oscillations of Gulf 18-0                  resulted from episodes of lower salinity, perhaps caused by                     increased monsoonal circulation.",
