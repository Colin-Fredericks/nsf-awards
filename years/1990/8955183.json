The 11th Biennial                          Conference will be held at the University of Atlanta, Athens GA                 in August of l990.                                                                                                                                              The objective of the project is to serve the needs of the                       underprepared high school teachers of chemistry.  Specifically,                 a series of lectures, demonstrations workshops, and computer-                   usage workshops are planned which will take place at the                        University of Georgia and Clark University before and after the                 week-long Conference.  During the Conference, the 100                           teacher/participants selected from within a 300 mile radius of                  the planned site will attend meetings, symposia, workshops and                  informal activities.  In this way they will begin to interact                   with the chemical education community.  This ought to help                      allay the teachers feelings of isolation from their peers.  The                                                                                                 participants' registration will be provided by the sponsoring                   organization, DivChed.  A Visiting Master Teacher Program and a                                                                                                 spring Follow-up Session are also included in the project in                    order to support and reinforce the momentum developed during                    the summer.                                                                                                                                                     A high priority of the program is to develop an infrastructure                  among teachers of the southeastern region of the United States,                                                                                                 particularly among those who are teaching large numbers of                      students who are traditionally underrepresented in the                          sciences.  It is hoped that this program will provide a model                   for enhancing the effectiveness of the DivChed Biennial                         Conferences in working with the underprepared and underserved                   precollege chemistry teachers.                                                                                                                                  Approximately one-third of the total cost of the project is                     being provided by private sector, the ACS, DivChed and in-kind                  contributions.",
