Arsenault, Director of the Metallurgical                             Materials Laboratory at the University of                                       Maryland, and San Patu of the Shenyang Institute                                of Metal Research, Shenyang, China.  The project                                is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese Academy of                                  Sciences.                                                                                                                                                       The investigators will undertake a new computer                                 development to determine the effect of a                                        non.random arrangement of solute atoms on the                                   strength of an alloy and also to determine if a                                 non.random arrangement is destroyed due to                                      pulling, bending, or twisting.  The strengthening                               of metals by additions to form alloys (the mixing                               of the atoms of one metal with atoms of another                                 metal) has been practiced for at least 4,000                                    years.  However, an understanding of how this                                   strengthening occurs is still lacking.  Several                                 years ago it was proposed that the non.random                                   arrangement of additional atoms within the metal                                would lead to strengthening, but it has been                                    suggested that the non.random arrangement (i.e.,                                the strengthening) could be destroyed when the                                  metal was actually bent, twisted, or pulled.                                                                                                                    Using high speed computers, it is now possible to                               construct a metal alloy in which the locations of                               all the atoms are known.  Therefore, it is                                      possible to have a random or non.random arrangement                             of the additional atoms in the metal.  Then it is                               possible to calculate the strength, again by the                                use of the high speed computer, with various                                    arrangements of the additional atoms.  While the                                method of calculating the strength by the use of                                high speed computers has been developed during                                  the last 20 years by Professor Arsenault's group,                               the proposed collaboration with the Chinese                                     Academy of Sciences will undertake research on a                                new aspect:  the effect of non.random arrangement                               of the additional atoms on the strength.",
