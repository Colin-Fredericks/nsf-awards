 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous studies document substantial genetic variation                    among and within populations of the same species.  Research                     intothe nature of this variation has discovered important                       ecological differentiation among populations and even among                     genotypes within the same population.  The P.I.'s propose to                    examine the significance of this within-species, genetic                        variation to the ecological interactions of competition.                        Their system is the plankton community of small lakes in                        southwestern Michigan.  Two species of zooplankton (Daphnia                     pulicaria and D. galeata  mendotae)are dominant herbivores that                 coexist i these lakes via vertical habitat partioning.  The                     investigations have documented large genetic variance within                    populations of one of these species and have preliminary evidence               that it represents ecological specialization via                                habitatselection.  The P.I.'s 1) more broadly test this                         hypothesis 2) describe the ecological and genetic trade-offs that               maintain intra-specific habitat specialization, and then 3)                     experimentally determine the ecological consequences of this                    variation to interspecific competition and to community response                to predation.  The results should be broadly applicable to many                 ecological communities.                                                              The proposed work will contribute to undergraduate,                        graduate, and postdoctoral training in aquatic ecology and                      evolutionary biology.  The grant would fund one postdoctoral                    scholar to work with the P.I. on merging issues of community                    ecology and life history evolution.  Two different Ph.D                         candidates will be involved in the proposed work, providing them                with training in both the laboratory and field (electrophoresis,                culture techniques, field manipulations, etc.).  We will involve                undergraduate students at three levels; REU's, field help, and                  formal course work.  In the past the P.I. has selected students                 from smaller universities that have restricted research                         opportunities for undergraduate (1989 REU's were Jennifer Welser                University of Vermont; Andrew Young - Swarthmore College).  These               students conduct their own, spin-off projects from the grant.  In               each year one undergraduate field assistant is hired (Jennelle                  Marceau in 1989).  Finally, the P.I. teaches courses in Limnology               (Summer), Ecology & Evolution (Fall), and Quantitative Methods                  (Spring).  Undergraduate in these courses are provided an                       opportunity to get involved in the P.I.'s research.",
