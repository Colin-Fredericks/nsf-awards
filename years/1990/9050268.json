 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this program enhance the ability of elementary                   school teachers to use the collections of zoos as living                        laboratories for their students.  Teachers from New York City                   as well as teams of teachers from across the United States                      will take part in the project. To support such widespread                       activity, fifteen additional zoos will participate directly                     sending a team of zoo educators and local teachers.  Ecology                    will be the overarching theme of the inservice activity and                     the participants will learn to use the zoo as an outdoor                        classroom for teaching about the earth's biomes and animal                      adaptations to habitats.  Specifically, the workshop series                     will highlight problems associated with endangered species,                     and will target the study of rain forests, deserts, wetlands,                   deciduous forests and grasslands.  As a result of the                           inservice a teachers' manual will be produced which will                        support the participants as they work with others to improve                    the teaching of life science at the elementary level.  The                      manual will also have many suggestions about inquiry                            activities that can be done at zoos or before or after                          visits.  It will be a valuable resource to teachers as well                     as others who are responsible introducing children to wealth                    of ideas, concepts and process that can be learned by                           studying animals in the zoo environment.                                                                                                                        The cost sharing for the project will be thirty percent of                      the NSF portion.",
