 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently two lecture-based courses are offered in biomedical                   engineering: first, \"Introduction to Biomedical Engineering\" is a               survey course open to all science and engineering students at the               university.  The other course, \"Biomedical Instrumentation\", is                 designed for senior-level electrical engineering students.  The                 objective of this project is to secure the necessary equipment to               realize an effective laboratory component for each of these                     courses.  For the introductory course, physiography units enable                the student to measure and analyze a variety of                                 electrophysiological and transduced signals from the human body.                Aside from valuable \"hands-on\" experimentation, these units would               provide a unique perspective of critical biomedical engineering                 design issues like patient safety, cost, and interference                       suppression.  For the instrumentation course, the personal                      computers and input/output boards enable the student to design and              build a complete electrophysiological data acquisition, display,                and analysis system.  The student develops skills applicable to a               large variety of engineering problems.  The realization of these                two laboratory components would significantly enhance the quality of            undergraduate science and engineering education.",
