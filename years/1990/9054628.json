 "awd_abstract_narration": "In every drop of water, down at the scale of atoms and molecules, there         is a world that can fascinate even young, non-verbal science students           and ardent science-phobes.  The objective will be to learn science              through guided discovery.  Students will study liquid water and                 molecular networks using advanced technology to provide windows into            submicroscopic worlds, first of water and later of macromolecules such          as proteins and DNA.  The study of water is interdisciplinary, spanning         the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and physics.  Students will study        questions that cut across these disciplines as well as those internal to        each field.  A new generation of desktop computers now permits us to            leapfrog directly from the large-scale properties of water that we              experience every day to \"real time\" dynamic motions in the                      submicroscopic world.  This permits students to learn according to a new        paradigm:  doing science while exploring and manipulating structures            using student-controlled, animated graphic, simulations on the molecular        scale, rather than being told about science and given tests on                  structures.  The project will actively develop this new paradigm and            probe student understanding and seek to determine if students can apply         their insights and developed intuition to predict the properties                of a wealth of alternative materials easily and rapidly modeled by the          computer.",
