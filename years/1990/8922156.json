 "awd_abstract_narration": "This very ambitious proposal tackles the issue of what is meant by              \"relative importance\" in preference judgment, how it enters into                decisions, and how it is communicated to others.  The concept of                relative importance plays an unusual role in current decision                   analyses.  In standard utility theories, importance has no                      meaningful interpretation.  However, people who actually make                   decisions find it a natural concept to use in thinking about                    preferences.  The principal investigators plan to evaluate a wide               variety of ramifications of the relative importance concept.                                                                                                    The plan behind the proposed research is to take a two-pronged                  approach involving both an examination of the technical aspects of              weighting coefficients and an empirical assessment of the                       psychological processes involved.  A particular focus will be on                the interpersonal aspects, i.e., the preferences of another person              that one infers from information on relative importance, or the                 weight judgments one infers from preferences for another.  Such                 inferences are commonly made and are basic to various collective                decision theories (especially agency theory).  Yet, there has been              almost no previous analysis on how such inferences are formed.  In              all, the proposed research will provide substantial new insights                into the concept of relative importance.",
