 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Geography at Clark               University to help purchase equipment which will be used to improve             the undergraduate physical geography and cartographic/GIS courses.              The strategy is to continue developing a hands-on problem solving               approach in laboratory classes.  The IDRISI-Geographic Analysis                 System will be used to develop realistic problem solving                        applications into skill-enhancing and geographic concept exercises.             Software modules, operational and under-development, that explore               basic geographic relations will be further integrated into                      laboratory sessions.  The major equipment to be purchased includes              computing, digitizing and printing hardware.  Besides the benefits              that will accrue to students at Clark University by improvements                in the geography courses, results will have widespread                          applicability throughout North America and Western Europe.  The                 modules and exercises that will be developed in conjunction with                this award, generally will be compatible with this GIS system.                  Thus, advances made in the Clark program will be readily                        transferable to other institutions.  The grantee is matching this               award with non-Federal sources.",
