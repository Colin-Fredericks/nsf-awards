 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cotton-top tamarins are one of the most endangered species                 and these individuals are increasingly threatened by habitat                    destruction.  Dr. Snowdon has developed a successful                            collaboration with INDERENA, the flora and fauna protection                     agency of Columbia, to study the behavior and biology of cotton-                top tamarins in their natural environment.  Although a wealth of                knowledge is available about these small New World primates kept                in captivity, little is known about their existence in the wild                 and their survival in the future is precarious at best.  Since                  the utmost importance for the survival of any endangered species                is that of reproduction, Dr. Snowdon will first use non-invasive                techniques to obtain hormonal samples from animals in the native                habitat.  These findings will be compared with data obtained from               groups of wild-caught tamarins housed in a captive, outdoor                     research facility to provide a better understanding of                          reproductive cycles and the influence of food distribution on                   seasonal breeding.  Collaborating with a specialized team of                    Colombian biologists, Dr. Snowdon will gather information on                    infant development and examine where there are differences in                   development and infant care between wild and captive groups.                    Such information on yearly reproductive output and infant                       survival will be used in planning long-term conservation                        programs, in the development of conservation education projection               and for scientific information that will generate new hypotheses                and validate studies on tamarins raised in captivity.  It is only               through an understanding of the biology and behavior of this                    species, the establishment of protected reserves, effective                     conservation education programs, and public support that the                    survival of cotton-top tamarins will be guaranteed to have a                    future in the wild.",
