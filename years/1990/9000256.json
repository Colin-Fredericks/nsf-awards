 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in automorphic forms and                  representation theory of Professor Freydoon Shahidi of Purdue                   University. One of Dr. Shahidi's projects is to study the                       possible equivalence, for a cusp form on a quasi-split group over               a number field, between having a non-zero Fourier coefficient                   with respect to a generic character of a maximal unipotent                      subgroup, and having generic local components everywhere. Another               related project is to prove the holomorphy of certain local L-                  functions related to tempered representations.                                       Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
