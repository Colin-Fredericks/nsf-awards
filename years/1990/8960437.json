 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to synthesize film forming biodegradable                         polymers, specifically a series of polylactic and polyglycolic                  acid copolymers, to serve as primary vehicles for anti-foul                     marine coatings.  The coatings are non-metal containing films                   which will controllably react with sea water at the desired                     rate to continuously provide a new surface for further                          erosion.  The products of the degradation will provide a                        localized pH unfavorable to barnacle and weed attachment while                  not producing pollutants or biological toxins.  Additionally                    the polymers exhibit excellent abrasion and oil resistance.                     \"In vitro\" and \"vivo\" testing of coated panels in synthetic                     and natural sea water should clearly establish the commercial                   potential and provide the necessary data for optimization and                   scale-up of the polymer synthesis in a follow up study.                                                                                                         Based upon current consumption of anti-foul coatings, approx.                   1.5 x 10(8) pounds of copper and tin are introduced into the                    world's waterways annually creating significant environmental                   problems manifested by polluted harbors and endangered marine                   life.  Our proposed coatings will allow protection of ships                     hulls but will not pollute the oceans.  The potential market                    is worldwide.",
