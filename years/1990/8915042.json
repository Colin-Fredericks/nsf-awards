 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will develop a generalized zonal method (GZM) for                  the analysis of radiative heat transfer in multi-dimensional                    absorbing, emitting, and anisotropically scattering media.                      The effect of non-diffuse of non-diffuse reflecting surfaces                    will also be explored.  The method to be used is a                              generalization of the \"conventional zonal method\", CZM, which                   was developed in fifties and has been the mainstay of                           practical calculations since then, with apparently little                       modification.  State-of-the-art parallel processing                             computational capabilities will be exploited enabling the                       solution of the vastly more complicated generalized equations.                  The main product of this research will be a method of such                      accuracy that it will serve as a benchmark for other                            approximations which have been in use, although not adequately                  validated.  The PI expects to generate some fundamental                         parameters based on a mean-beam-length concept which be useful                  for scaling model experiments to full-scale prototypes. The                     code developed will be critically compared with existing                        experimental data.",
