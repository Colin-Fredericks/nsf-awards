 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in heterocyclic                  chemistry between Dr. Albert Padwa, Emory University, and Dr.                   Christopher Moody, Imperial College of Science, London, England.                The objective of the project is the development of a general,                   broadly applicable method for the synthesis of novel heterocyclic               systems.                                                                                                                                                        Emphasis will be placed on the use of a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition               chemistry for the construction of a variety of interesting                      heterocycles.  Among the reactions to be studies are cycloaddi-                 tions of carbonyl ylides, azomthine ylides and thicarbonyl                      ylides.  The project will focus on using the rhodium catalyzed                  reaction of diazo carbonyl compounds as a method for generating                 a variety of 1,3-dipoles. The project will benefit from the                     complementary expertise of the two investigators. The area of                   proposed research is of paramount importance in the pharmaceutical              industry, as well as in the areas of agricultural and photographic              chemicals.  The joint effort of these two researchers is likely                 to make a fundamental contribution to the above fields.",
