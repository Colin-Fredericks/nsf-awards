 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a sound, well-considered dissertation proposal to study                 children's decision-making in social situations.  The general goals             of this investigation are to understand children's social decision-             making processes and to evaluate the relation between these                     processes and behavioral outcomes.  The task itself, reactions to               provocation in everyday situations, is socially important to both               children and adults.  Neither the problem nor the approach have                 received much consideration in the judgment-decision field or in                the developmental-personality field.  This work should give useful              results at both basic and applied levels.  In sum, this project is              significant because it is the first attempt to construct and test               empirically a specific, process-oriented theory of children's                   social decision making in an ecologically relevant behavioral                   situation.",
