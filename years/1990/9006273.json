 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are several broad goals of the proposed research.  The               first is to produce a molecular phylogeny of 18 superfamilies of                the more advanced groups of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera)                 and of various groups (families and subfamilies) within two of                  the most conspicuous and widely studied superfamilies, true                     butterflies and noctuoid moths.  Second, by assessing the nature                and rate of evolution of mitochondrial and nuclear genes the                    research will contribute to the fields of molecular biology and                 evolution.  This research is of fundamental importance not only                 because it will contribute new insights into the systematics of                 Lepidoptera, but because it will provide a framework for                        inferences about evolution, biogeography, and speciation.                            To resolve phylogenetic relationships at higher taxonomic                  levels in Lepidoptera, a molecular viewpoint is required because                of the paucity of morphological structures that define groups.                  For example, butterflies have undergone a tremendous amount of                  adaptive radiation but exhibit few unique biological                            characteristics that link them with any particular moth group.                  At least six moth groups have been proposed to be butterfly                     ancestors.  A molecular phylogeny should resolve these unanswered               questions about the origin of butterflies.",
