 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory has cloned and characterized several avirulence                 genes from bacterial pathogens in the Pseudomonas syringae group                that are responsible for defensive surveillance by soybean                      plants.  One of these genes, avrD from P. syringae pv. tomato,                  causes bacterial hosts to elaborate an extracellular elicitor                   compound.  The isolated elicitor causes the hypersensitive                      response (HR) only on soybean cultivars containing                              thecomplementary disease resistance gene, Rpg4.  AvrD also has                  several other interesting features such as its occurrence, along                with four other linked genes, on an indigenous bacterial plasmid                and its 100-fold induction when bacteria are grown in soybean                   leaves as compared to culture media.  The interaction of bacteria               carrying avrD with plant hosts therefore involves reciprocal                    signalling mechanisms that initiate precise developmentalprograms               in both organisms.  This proposal requests support to further                   study avrD and its role in initiating plant disease resistance by               1) characterizing the avrD elicitor; 2) elucidating the nature of               plant induction of avrD; 3) studying the indigenous plasmid on                  which avrD occurs and 4) comparing avrD withhomologous genes that               occur in other P. syringae pathovars.                                                                                                                           The proposed research should contribute significantly to our                    understanding of plant-microbe signalling mechanisms and disease                resistance in plants.",
