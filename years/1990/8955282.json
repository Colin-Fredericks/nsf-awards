 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy at Moorhead State                       University is offering a series of three, four week,                            institutes providing professional development opportunities                     for underprepared high school physics and physical science                      teachers.  The institutes will be held over three successive                    summers beginning in 1990.  The overall objective of the                        institutes is the upgrading of breadth of content and                           teaching skills.  The content areas are mechanics, waves,                       electromagnetism, optics and selected areas of modern                           physics.  These institutes will provide opportunities for 20-                   24 high school teachers, per year, from the tri-state region                    of Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.  It is expected                    that the majority of the teachers will attend all three                         institutes.  Selected participants will represent a good mix                    of private and public school teachers, as well as an                            equitable gender mix.  Participants can earn (8-10) graduate                    credits per summer.                                                                                                                                             Since the institutes are designed to focus on the upgrading                     of the content and teaching skills of underprepared teachers,                   planned activities will involve lectures, activities and                        readings on basic mathematical skills pedagogy and teaching                     methods, as well as the physics content.  A major emphasis                      will be on hands-on activities, such as projects, development                   of lecture demonstrations, the use of computers as                              teaching/learning aids, and the critical analysis of subject                    matter content.  Opportunities will be available for help                       sessions/tutorials which will enhance the participant's                         problem solving skills and for the development of simple,                       inexpensive, but pedagogically sound, physics demonstration                     and laboratory materials.  Guest speakers, including                            accomplished high school teachers, will be invited to                           interact with the participants on various aspects of teaching                   methods, pedagogy and research, and industrial innovations.                     Follow-up activities include one-day sessions at Moorhead                       State University and site visits to teachers classrooms.  Two                   high school teachers, (Presidential Awardees or PTRAS) who                      have expressed a long term commitment for improved science                      education will be involved in the planning and delivery of                      the institutes' activities and in developing comprehensive                      evaluation procedures to determine the effectiveness of the                     project.                                                                                                                                                        Cost sharing in an amount of $89,000 equals 40% of the NSF                      award.",
