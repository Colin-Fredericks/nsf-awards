 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Gene F. Morris,                      Department of Chemistry, Western Carolina University (WCU),                     and Dr. Themba Tyobeka, Department of Chemistry, University                     of Swaziland (UNISWA), to pursue, for a period of 24                            months, a program of cooperative research on synthetic                          routes for the preparation of thiophospholipids.                                Phospholipids are a major class of compounds present in the                     cell membranes of most organisms.  Ultimately the goals of                      the synthetic schemes to be undertaken by these                                 collaborators are (1) the production of 1- and                                  2-thiophospholipids, compounds in which sulfur has replaced                     oxygen on the first or second carbon atoms of the glycerol                      chain and (2) to study the role of phospholipids in                             membranes by substituting thiophospholipids which have                          similar properties and, unlike phospholipids, may be                            followed by continuous spectrophotometric analysis.  In                         addition to the chemical research to be undertaken, each                        collaborator will visit the other's university and provide                      consultation and lectures designed to strengthen each                           institution's program in chemistry.                                                                                                                             This project provides support for a long-standing                               relationship between WCU and UNISWA which now is in its                         eighth year.  During that period, each university has                           assisted faculty of the other in research activities.  The                      present project will allow the collaborators to complete                        the synthesis of thiophospholipids which was started when                       Dr. Tyobeka was a visiting faculty associate at WCU in                          1988.  This project is relevant to the objectives of the                        Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks to                          increase the level of cooperation between U.S. scientists                       and engineers and their counterparts in developing                              countries through the exchange of scientific information,                       ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on                      problems of mutual benefit.",
