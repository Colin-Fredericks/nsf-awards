 "awd_abstract_narration": "The globalization of science is occurring in parallel with a rapid              expansion in the speed and sophistication of information and data               handling technologies, and their use for scientific purposes.                   Developments in these areas permit the planning and execution of                large scale scientific programs.  Such programs, in turn, frequently            require sophisticated data handling and processing techniques.  In              view of the multilateral character of many large scale scientific               programs, the handling, processing, and transmission of scientific              data has a major international enterprise in its own right, one                 that is vital to those large scale programs.                                                                                                                    The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) is a                  non-governmental, multilateral body, affiliated with the Interna-               tional Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU), whose principal                     objective is to facilitate worldwide communication on problems                  related to scientific data.  Like other members of the ICSU                     family, CODATA is comprised of non-governmental National Member                 Organizations.  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) fulfills                 that function in the United States.  In the past, NAS's request to              support US participation in CODATA has been limited to payment of               dues, shared jointly by NSF, NIST, and DOE.  The NAS, in order to               upgrade US participation, has established a U.S. National Committee             (USNC) for CODATA similar to those that guide U.S. participation                in the ICSU unions; it proposes to establish a core program based               on tht committee that would be managed by a full-time NAS                       professional.  NSF is being asked to support 30 percent of that                 core program (along with NIST and DOE), and pay one-third of the                $40,000 US annual dues for CODATA.",
