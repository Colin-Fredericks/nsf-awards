 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator has generated four monoclonal antibodies that                  bind to basement membranes in peripheral nerve and cardiac and                  skeletal muscle, but do not recognize any epitopes in the central               nervous system.  These antibodies interfere with neurite growth                 in vitro.  The location of these determinants and their                         functional activity suggest that these antibodies recognize                     constituents important for allowing successful axonal                           regeneration in the peripheral nervous system.  The PC1C5 antigen               is of particular interest since this antibody does not bind to                  the Schwann cell basement membrane in sections of sciatic nerves                from homozygous dystrophic mice (dy/dy); all other antibodies                   tested (34 in total) do stain Schwann cell basement membranes in                dy/dy mice.  The objectives of the research are to: 1) test the                 PC1C5 antigen for its ability to promote neurite outgrowth; 2)                  obtain partial amino acid sequence for this antigen and look for                homology to other previously characterized proteins; 3) screen                  cDNA expression libraries with the four antibodies or with                      synthetic oligonucleotide probes based on the sequences obtained                in objective 2; 4) compare the molecular differences between                    PC1C5 antigens synthesized by Schwann cells and muscle cells; 5)                screen libraries from various normal and dy/dy tissues with                     probes obtained from expression libraries in objective 3; and 6)                generate Schwann cell lines from normal and dy/dy mice in an                    attempt to provide an in vitro model for the dystrophic mutation.",
