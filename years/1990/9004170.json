 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will test two working models which explain the                    relationship between phosphorylation of the two sperm specific                  basic nuclear proteins (Sp histones) of the sea urchin, chromatin               structural alterations and male nuclear decondensation. The first               model postulates that the phosphorylation of specific                           tetrapeptide sites in these proteins alters physical properties                 such as thermal stability, nuclease accessibility, average                      nucleosomal repeat length and histone DNA binding affinities that               reveal how the histones and DNA are arranged. The experiments                   are designed to assess the contribution of each Sp histone                      separately. Measurements will be made on chromatin reconstituted                from purified histones and DNA in the absence of complicating                   factors present in the living cell. The results will elucidate                  some of the alterations on first order chromatin structure                      observed in vivo. The second model addresses the potential                      consequences of Sp histone phosphorylation upon male chromatin                  decondensation and postulates at least two requirements for                     decondensation: phosphorylation and activation of a factor(s)                   sensitive to the drug 6-dimethylaminopurine. Using                              microinjection of condensed nuclei differing in their degree of                 phosphorylation, several factors will be evaluated including the                role of Sp histone phosphorylation in decondensation, and the                   role of other metabolic activities. The factors absent in                       immature oocytes will be investigated, and an assay will be                     developed for the decondensation factor(s) which are sensitive to               the drug. The consequences of phosphorylation at the specific                   tetrapeptide sites are unlikely to be restricted to sea urchin                  male germ cells. Similar sites are known in most H1 histones and                in several nucleic acid packaging proteins and regulators,                      emphasizing the general importance of studying their                            phosphorylation.                                                                %%%                                                                             The long term objective of this research is an understanding of                 the inactivation/activation of the sperm nucleus which occurs                   during spermatogenesis and following fertilization. The                         successful genetic reactivation of the dormant sperm nucleus by                 egg cytoplasm, following fertilization, is essential to                         successful biparental embryonic development.",
