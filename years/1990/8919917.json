 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in biological                    oceanography between Dr. Francois Morel, Massachusetts Institute                of Technology and Dr. Jean-Marie Martin, Ecole Normale Superieure,              Paris, France.  The objective of this project is to study the                   nature, dynamics, metal binding and geochemical role of colloids                and microparticles in natural waters.                                                                                                                           The US and French groups have several common long term research                 aims: 1) to characterize aquatic particles (including colloids)                 and their dynamics 2) to characterize and model the binding of                  metals to particles and colloids and 3) to quantify; and model the              role of solution/particle exchanges in the geochemistry and                     geobiology of trace elements in natural waters.  In this project                the collaborators will focus on 1) the development of fluorescence              spectroscopy techniques for the characterization of aquatic                     particles and colloids and 2) the development of thermodynamic                  models of metal binding, validated and contrained with new specific             calorimetric, kinetic and spectroscopic data.  The project will                 benefit from the complementary expertise of the US investigator in              large particles and geochemistry and the experience of the French               in colloids and physicochemical mechanisms.  Because microparticles             and colloids have major carriers of trace elements in natural                   waters, an elucidation of their dynamics is essential to an                     understanding of the biogeochemistry of trace elements, both                    natural and anthropogenic.",
