 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primate Family Cheirogaleidae is classified within the                 suborder Strepsirhini which includes both lemuriform primates                   from Madagascar and lorisiform primates from Africa and Asia.                   The exact placement of the Cheirogaleidae, which are found only                 in Madagascar, has been a problem for some time.  Traditionally                 they have been placed with the other Madagascar primates, largely               on a biogeographic basis.  Most recent classifications, however,                place them with the African/Asian lorisiform primates, largely on               the basis of features in the base of the skull.                                      This proposal addresses the question: are the cheirogaleid                 primates more closely related to the lemuriform or to the                       lorisiform primates?  A number of data sets, including                          anatomical, embryological, and genetic information will examined                to determine their relationships.  The clarification of                         cheirogaleid affinities will be significant for at least three                  reasons.  A classification is necessary that is commensurate with               phylogenetic relationships.  An understanding of the sister-group               relationships between cheirogaleids and other strepsirhines is                  necessary to determine the effects of homology versus                           convergence.  And, if cheirogaleids and lorisiforms are more                    closely related it will confirm that multiple migrations between                Madagascar and Africa must have occurred during the history of                  the primates.",
