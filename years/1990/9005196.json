 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first objective of this work is to develop regenerable                      polymeric reagents for asymmetric reductions.  The                              reagents will be complexes of optically active (chiral)                         helical polymers and borane.  These polymers are                                conveniently synthesized by living anionic polymerization                       techniques using chiral initiators.  An example of such an                      optically active polymer is poly (phenyl-2-pyridyl-o-                           tolylmethylmethacrylate).  The presence of the 2-pyridyl                        groups in the polymer should allow for the preparation of                       the optically active polymer/borane complexes similar to                        poly (2-vinylpyridine)/borane complexes.  The optically                         active reducing reagents will be used to reduce prochiral                       carbonyl functionalities.  The second objective of the                          project is to synthesize a class of isotactic polymers                          which will exhibit specific secondary structures i.e.                           helix.  This goal will be accomplished by first developing                      an understanding of the relationship between the structure                      of the monomer and the tendency to isotactic specific                           polymerization.  The starting point of this project will                        be the synthesis and stereochemical characterization of                         poly (4-vinylquinoline) and poly (2-vinylnaphthalene).  It                      is expected that such isotactic polymers with specific                          secondary structures or \"steric-stereoregular\" polymers                         will have potential applications in molecular biology,                          synthetic enzymes and regenerable asymmetric reagents.//",
