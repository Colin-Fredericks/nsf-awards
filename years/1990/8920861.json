 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Carr will continue research toward understanding the emission               from Jupiter which occurs at relatively long wavelengths.  He will              broaden a monitoring program that has been conducted at the                     University of Florida Radio Observatory since 1957, and which                   includes continuous monitoring of S burst storms with a radio                   spectrograph of very high sensitivity and resolution and                        observations with interferometers having baselines of 30 miles                  east-west and 100 miles north-south.  Dr. Carr plans to make a new              determination of the rotation period of Jupiter's magnetosphere                 which should help establish the magnitude of wandering of Jupiter's             magnetic pole.  A new catalog of S burst storms will be used to                 test current theories for the emission of S type bursts.                                                                                                        Jupiter's decametric wavelength bursts and the bursts from the                  active Sun are by far the most powerful of the radiations of                    extraterrestrial origin that are received on Earth.  The bursts                 from Jupiter occur only below a frequency of 40 MHz, and they can               be studied from Earth down to about 10 MHz, below which observation             is prevented by the effects of the terrestrial ionosphere.  The                 close approach of two Voyager spacecraft to Jupiter in 1979                     provided new insights into the phenomenolgy and beaming geometry                of the decametric wavelength component.  Despite the enormous                   amount of observational data that resulted from the Voyager                     encounters, ground-based observations have lost none of their                   importance.  The low frequency radiations from giant planet                     magnetospheres are still unexplained.  We are still in the stage                of unraveling the more and more complex phenomenologies of the                  radiations, but phenomenology and theory are now being tied                     together.  This will be strengthened as ground based monitoring                 programs span more years, as the observations become more                       sophisticated, and as the Galileo spacecraft adds important post-               Voyager data to what is known about those radiation components that             are prevented by the ionosphere from reaching the Earth's surface.              Dr. Carr's project is a principal component in the ground-based                 effort to understand the nature of these long wavelength emissions.",
