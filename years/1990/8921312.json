 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in atmospheric chemistry has the ultimate goal of                 simulating by mathematical modeling any complex system of                       coupled chemical reactions in the atmosphere.  The result can                   be the capability of predicting any changes in the composition                  of the atmosphere resulting from varying natural conditions or                  the introduction of man-made contaminants.  The resolution of                   important practical and scientific problems requires the                        acquisition of the best possible values of the reaction speeds                  (kinetic constants) of the may elementary steps that make up                    the chemistry of the atmosphere.  Among these problems are the                  stability of the stratospheric ozone layer, the appearance in                   urban air of secondary pollutants that were not present in the                  emissions of any contaminating source, and the course of                        evolution of planetary atmospheres, including the atmosphere of                 our own planet.                                                                      This project attacks one of the most difficult, but                        necessary, aspects of atmospheric chemistry - the measurement                   of the reaction rates for chemical processes involving free                     radicals, most of which are unstable and extremely reactive                     fragments of the stable molecules of the atmosphere.  Because                   they are so reactive, they occur in exceedingly low                             concentrations and are therefore measurable only by highly                      sophisticated techniques.  It is their high reactivity,                         however, that makes them such active participants in the                        chemistry of the air and can allow them to determine the fate                   of more abundant species, such as hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide,                 ozone, etc.  The  project will measure the reaction rates for                   several key chemical processes involving radical-radical and                    radical-molecule interactions in the sulfur, nitrogen, halogen,                 oxygen and hydrogen systems.  These systems are important                       elements in contemporary approaches to the chemistries of clean                 and polluted air.",
