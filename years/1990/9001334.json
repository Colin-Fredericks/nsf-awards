 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued funding for an ongoing undergraduate research program that            for five years has been training electrical engineering and computer            science students during the summers before their senior years is                sought.  Students will be recruited from a variety of other schools,            including primarily undergraduate institutions.  The research                   environment will be enriched by additional undergraduate students               funded from other sources.  Each participant will have regular                  meetings with an individual faculty mentor to plan work and review              progress throughout the eleven week program.  Project topics in                 electrophysics will include artificial plasmas, microwave propagation.          microstrip antennas, frequency doubling in lasers, picosecond opto-             electronics, and thin film devices.  Information systems topics will            include image communication, multi-variable feedback control,                   continuous phase modulation digital signalling, LAN simulation tools,           and robotics.  All will benefit from extensive interactions with                participating faculty and graduate students.  Participants will have            informative tours of our research laboratories.  There will be two or           three seminar presentations to the group by leaders from industry,              universities or government agencies.  A tour will be arranged at a              nearby industrial lab or national laboratory.  The program will                 terminate with a two-day research review during which each student              will make a presentation and answer abstract of his report.  A prize            will be awarded to the best project.",
