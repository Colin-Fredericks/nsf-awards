Capone and Carpenter propose to continue their                             investigations of the biochemistry, physiology and ecology of                   N2 fixation in planktonic microorganisms, and particularly the                  non-heterocystous cyanobacterium Trichodesmium.  These studies                  are important as Trichodesmium is a substantial component of                    the phytoplankton populations of tropical and subtropical seas                  and a major contributor of new nitrogen to these systems.                       Furthermore, the nitrogenase enzyme system of Trichodesmium                     appears distinct in several respects from the more well studied                 non-heterocystous analogues.  An understanding of the                           biochemical and molecular mechanisms used by Trichodesmium to                   maintain active nitrogen fixation would be of broad relevance.                                                                                                  They will determine the factors (biochemical and ecological)                    which regulate N2 fixation and growth in Trichodesmium, as well                 as its importance in the marine food web.  Specifically, they                   will pursue studies of:  1) the mechanisms for protecting                       nitrogenase from oxygen deactivation (oxygen protective enzyme                  systems such as superoxide dismutase, uptake hydrogenases                       etc.); 2) factors controlling the apparent endogenous rhythms                   of nitrogenase synthesis and activity, and of regulation of                     nitrogenase synthesis and activity, ATP/ADP ratios); 3) how                     fixed nitrogen is transferred between N2 fixing and non-fixing                  cells within a colony; 4) the causes and significance of diel                   changes in buoyancy; and 5) the fate of nitrogen and carbon                     recently fixed by Trichodesmium in near surface waters.                                                                                                         This research program is unique in that it brings together a                    diverse group of investigators to work on a broad array of                      topics concerning the biology and ecology of Trichodesmium and                  other open ocean nitrogen fixers.",
