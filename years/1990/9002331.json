 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of viscosity solutions to                  fully nonlinear partial differential equations.  Earlier work in                this area set the stage for the complete development now                        available for first order equations in finite dimensions, and                   subsequent developments in the theory of viscosity solutions of                 first and second-order fully nonlinear equations yielded strongly               developing theories of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite                    dimensions and fully nonlinear second order equations in finite                 and infinite dimensions.  The present work is concerned with                    viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations in infinite                    dimensions, second order equations in both finite and infinite                  dimensions, and second order equations in the space of integrable               functions.                                                                           In recent years there has been a remarkable development of                 the theory of fully nonlinear partial differential equations of                 first and second order; this development followed the successful                introduction of the notion of \"viscosity solutions\" of these                    equations which allows one to admit nowhere differentiable                      functions as solutions.  Equations of this sort arise in many                   areas of mathematics and its applications, including control                    theory, the theory of differential games, problems of a                         geometrical nature, asymptotic problems, etc., etc.  The pace of                this development is currently at its peak, and fundamental work                 remains to be done to render the theory more accessible, more                   general, and more complete.  The proposed work lies in these                    directions and chiefly concerns the using of the new methods to                 complete several aspects, including \"infinite dimensional\"                      versions partially motivated by the theories of control and                     differential games involving systems whose state lies in infinite               dimensional spaces and more penetrating studies of the finer                    structure of viscosity solutions in both infinite and finite                    dimensional settings.",
