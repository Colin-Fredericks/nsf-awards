 "awd_abstract_narration": "Primary productivity of mangroves is an important source of                nutrients for adjacent marine systems.  The level of productivity               is affected not only by environmental factors but also by other                 components of the mangrove community.  Nutrient enrichment might                have direct impact on aquatic food webs by increasing primary                   productivity of mangroves, but enrichment to coastal waters might               be mitigated because as much as 20% of mangrove leaf material is                removed by herbivores.  The objective of this study is to                       determine the effects of nutrient enrichment on primary                         productivity of the key mangrove species, Rhizophora mangle, and                on rates of insect herbivory in a controlled experiment in which                nutrient availability in sediment is manipulated.  The following                hypotheses will be tested:                                                                                                                                      1.   Nutrient enrichment causes increased leaf production and                        terminal branch production, internodal elongation, and                          flowering.                                                                 2.   Nutritional quality (e.g., CNP ratio, water content) of                         mangrove tissues increases following nutrient enrichment of                     the sediment.                                                              3.   Nutritional quality of mangrove tissues correlates with                         rates of insect herbivory by both leaf feeders (folivores)                      and twig borers (xylovores).                                               4.   Secondary use of R. mangle twigs by insects and their kin,                      e.g., predators, parasites, twig-nesting ants, etc.,                            increases with rate of primary herbivory.                                  5.   Proportions of species in the twig-feeding guild of R.                          mangle change following nutrient enrichment.                                                                                                               This research will contribute to the knowledge base on mangrove                 ecology and may provide important information useful in                         conservation of mangroves.//",
