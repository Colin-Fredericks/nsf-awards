 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will document the effects ofconceptually-based instruction         in elementary school mathematics over a three year period.  A primary           aim is to uncover the long term effects of early conceptual                     understandings.  Instruction will be designed to support students'              efforts to acquire numeration and place value concepts by engaging them         in application and problem situations.  A goal of the special                   instruction is to help students become competent with the base-10               written notation by using mathematical symbols as tools--tools for              recording and sharing mathematical ideas and tools for thinking about           mathematics.  The initial sample of first graders will include                  experimental classes that receive the conceptually -enriched instruction        and control classes that receive only conventional instruction.  All            students will be followed through third grade.  Each year about half the        students will receive the special instruction while they are studying           the target concepts.  All students will receive specially designed              written test three times each year and a subsample will be individually         interviewed immediately after each written test.  Analyses will focus on        four                                                                            issues:  (1) changes over time in students' thought                             processes and performance as a result of conceptually-based                     instruction; (2) differences in these changes between                           students with differing levels of conceptual acquisitions;                      (3) differences in these changes between students who                           receive conceptually-based instruction earlier rather than                      later; and (4) relationships between conceptual                                 acquisitions and successful performance.",
