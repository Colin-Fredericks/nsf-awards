These constructions hold a special                interest because they seem to behave in some respects like                      complex sentences (biclauses) and in other respects like simple                 sentences (monoclauses).  This dual behavior has proved difficult               for current syntactic theory to account for in a principled                     fashion.                                                                                                                                                        The claim explored here is that the biclausal properties of                     Causative and Restructuring constructions can be accounted for                  within a purely monoclausal analysis-that is, an analysis that                  treats these constructions purely as simple sentences.  This                    dissertation project develops such an approach for Spanish.                     Among the analytic issues addressed are: the interaction of                     Restructuring with passive, the interaction of Causative with                   reflexives; and the syntax of Restructuring constructions formed                from psychological verbs.  Because many of the revelant facts                   have not yet been documented, this project constitutes a                        contribution to the description of Spanish syntax as well as to                 the analysis of a theoretically recalcitrant construction.",
