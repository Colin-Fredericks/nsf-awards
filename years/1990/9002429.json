 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will lie in the area of mathematical                         statistics and will concern bootstrap methodology.  The bootstrap               methodology was introduced by Efron in 1979 and is being                        increasingly used in statistical inference in a wide variety of                 situations.  The method is simple, generally applicable both in                 parametric and nonparametric problems, and has great potential to               be an important tool in extracting information from data.  This                 research is aimed at examining the existing techniques and                      working out modified or alternative techniques which lead to                    more efficient results.                                                              The bootstrap method is highly computational and this grant                supports computer equipment to continue work in this area of                    statistics.  In addition to this equipment support, the principal               investigator is supported by the Army Research Office and the Air               Force Office of Scientific Research.",
