 "awd_abstract_narration": "International cooperative research is very beneficial in                        the stimulation of research program ideas as well as in                         the sharing of costs and research results.  In addition,                        duplication of research is avoided, saving time and money.                      A meeting held in December 1989 in England, between                             representatives of the Department of Technology and                             Industry in the United Kingdom and the National Science                         Foundation indicated a strong interest on both sides to                         conduct cooperative research projects in ocean                                  engineering.  Workshops conducted in selected research                          areas would then lead to cooperative proposals in these                         ocean engineering areas.  The subject area for possible                         cooperation include, Autonomous underwater vehicles and                         subsea robotics technology.                                                                                                                                     It is proposed that a workshop be held at Florida Atlantic                      University in the United States in the Spring of 1990.                          The workshop will be four days long plus one or two days                        for faculty visits.  Invited papers on selected topics                          would be presented on the first day of the workshop.",
