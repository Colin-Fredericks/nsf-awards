 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at the University of                    Illinois at Urbana-Champaign supports a broad range of                          interactive and interdisciplinary research organized around the                 general theme of structured materials in six primary thrust                     areas.  The optical semiconductors and heterostructures thrust                  focuses on semiconductor heterostructures and superlattices.                    Investigations include advanced methods of multilayer                           fabrication, microstructural characterization, diffusion and                    disordering, and electronic and vibrational properties.  The                    thrust on advanced catalytic materials aims to extend the range                 of catalytic materials that can be made, control their                          microstructure, develop techniques to characterize the                          microstructure, and understand the relationship between structure               and function.  Activities in the mechanisms of high temperature                 superconductivity thrust center around two main questions:  (i)                 what are the underlying mechanisms responsible for high                         temperature superconductivity, and (ii) how can materials be                    prepared to study these mechanisms and to enhance desirable                     properties of the new materials?  The thrust group in advanced                  computational materials research is developing new algorithmic                  approaches to problems in materials science, designed to                        exploit the most advanced computational systems available and                   to look forward to developing architectures for computers that                  will change desirable algorithmic characteristics.  A new thrust                in self-ordering macromolecular materials  brings together                      researchers from materials science, physics, chemical                           engineering and biochemistry to explore features of                             self-organization (spontaneous development of structure) in                     organic macromolecular materials.  Finally, properties of                       mesoscopic systems is a new MRL effort directed toward                          fabricating submicron thin film structures and studying                         electronic transport phenomena in them.                                                                                                                         The MRL also supports the development, operation and                            maintenance of major central materials research facilities, and                 provides seed funds for new faculty and high-risk research                      related to its overall program.  The program currently involves                 47 faculty members from chemical sciences, engineering,                         materials science and physics, 14 postdoctoral research                         associates, 61 graduate students, 10 other scientific and                       technical professionals and 6 students participating in                         \"Research Experience for Undergraduates\".
