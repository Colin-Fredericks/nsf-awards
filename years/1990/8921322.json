 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silicon nitride has potential uses in automobile engines, as                    turbine blades and any other parts needed for very high                         temperature service.  Silicon nitride has high:  strength,                      thermal shock resistance, and oxidation resistance at elevated                  temperatures.  Silicon nitride powder is now produced by a                      batch process which is very expensive.  The PIs plan to                         explore developing a continuous fluidized bed process which                     would more economically produce high purity silicon nitride                     powder in large quantities.                                                                                                                                     The project will proceed in three stages:  (1) study of the                     kinetics of silicon nitride formation (2) elucidation of the                    reaction mechanisms, and (3) development of a fluidized bed                     reactor system for producing the material.  Specific work done                  in each of these stages will include:  (1) study of the                         kinetics that may be expected in a fluidized bed reactor by                     investigation of  the reaction mechanisms in detail in terms                    of the correlations between reaction conditions and product                     crystal structure using TGA and X-ray diffractometry methods;                   (2) development of a mathematical model to describe the                         progress of the reaction on the basis of the data obtained                      from the above experiments and (3) building and testing a                       fluidized bed reactor to handle this very complex process.                      Because particles  in the one micron diameter range will be                     involved, three techniques will be tried to generate the                        fluidized bed:  (1) partly sintering this very fine silicon                     powder to form aggregates 200 - 300 microns in size which                       fludize satisfactorily, (2) mixing the fine silicon powder                      with larger (greater than 100 microns) inert      carrier                       solids which fluidize well, and (3) trying fast fluidized beds                  and/or pneumatic transport reactors.",
