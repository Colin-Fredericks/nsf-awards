 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increase in disorder which leads to a metal-insulator                       transition through increasing electron localization also leads to               a gradual destruction of superconductivity.  Their measurements                 in granular aluminum have demonstrated the close relation of the                two phenomena and the existence of a metallic non-superconducting               phase.  They will make similar measurements on other materials,                 including granular composites, doped strontium titanate, and high               temperature superconducting metal oxides, where their initial                   work shows similar behavior.  They will investigate                             superconductivity in the vicinity of the metal-insulator                        transition and the influence of increasing electron localization                on its disappearance by a wide range of electric, magnetic and                  thermal measurements.  The specimens will include single crystal                and polycrystalline bulk material as well as thin films, prepared               partly in their laboratory and also in several collaborating                    universities, governmental and industrial laboratories.",
