 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major challenges in computational mechanics is the                   development of numerical methods for resolving the structure                    of functions with high gradients in complicated geometries.  In                 problems such as material failure due to localization and crack                 propagation, or shocks in fluid dynamics, the regions of high                   gradients are of several orders of magnitude smaller than the                   size of the domain of interest.  Therefore, if a uniform finite                 element mesh is used, a tremendous amount of elements                           would be needed to accurately resolve the structure of high                     gradients.                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of this research is to improve the quality of finite                element calculations in the regions of high gradients.  This is                 accomplished by superimposing a patch of higher order                           hierarchical elements on the portion of the original finite                     element mesh where resolution is required.  Continuity of the                   displacement field is maintained by imposing homogenous                         boundaries between the original and superimposed fields.  The                   superimposed and the original mesh topology.  The research                      to be carried out as part of this project will consider the                     following aspects:                                                                                                                                               1.    The development and implementation of the                                       finite element mesh superposition method.                                                                                                                 2.    Automation of the superposition method.                                                                                                                  High resolution of the fields will be obtained by controlling the               location of the superimposed field, its subdivision and the                     polynomial order of the superimposed elements.  The process                     of selection of these variables will be steered by a posteriori                 information.  Pointwise error and the superimposed mesh will                    be designed to make a nearly optimal use of posterior                           information.",
