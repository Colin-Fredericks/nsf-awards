Project funding will allow Dr. Alpar three                   six-week visits to Dr. Pines' laboratory and one two-week visit                 by Dr. Pines to Dr. Alpar's laboratory.  This collaborative                     research effort is for theoretical study of the internal                        structure and dynamics of neutron stars.                                                                                                                        Scope:  This proposal will bring together research scientists                   from the universities of two countries working in the area of                   neutron star dynamics.  The further refinement and re-evaluation                of theories concerning the rotational behavior of neutron stars                 is the primary objective of this US-Turkey scientific                           collaboration.  It is anticipated that a review article on                      superfluidity in neutron stars will result from this effort.                    This proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in Developing                   Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific                    knowledge through an international collaboration.",
