 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support research on inverse problems in                  partial differential equations.  In particular the research will                focus on the impedance tomography problem, the problem of                       characterization of the Dirichlet to Neumann map, the inverse                   conductivity problem for anisotropic conductivities in                          dimensions greater than or equal to three, and related problems                 in inverse scattering and inverse problems that arise in                        differential geometry.                                                               When an electric potential is applied to the surface of a                  conducting body, the resulting current flux across the surface                  depends on the internal resistance of the body.  For this reason,               voltage and current measurements made on the boundary of an                     object can be used to probe the internal structure of the body.                 The problem is to determine as much information as possible about               the internal resistivity from measurements of voltage potentials                and corresponding current fluxes at the boundary.  This problem,                often referred to as impedance computed tomography or electrical                impedance imaging, arose in geophysics from attempts to determine               the composition of the earth.  More recently, it has been                       proposed as a potentially valuable diagnostic tool for the                      medical and biological sciences.",
