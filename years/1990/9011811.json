 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Drs. Susan and               Roderick McIntosh and collaborators will begin a long-term study                of the recent prehistory of the Middle Senegal Valley, Senegal.                 They will focus their attention on the most recent two thousand                 years, and through a combination of site survey, mapping, and                   excavation accumulate enough data to reconstruct both cultural                  and environmental change over the last two millennia.  Attention                will focus on two large sites, Cubalel and Sincu Bara.  At both                 excavation should yield a wide variety of faunal and floral                     remains which will permit reconstruction of subsistence                         techniques.  The sites will also yield a variety of cultural                    material.  Through combined use of radiocarbon and                              archaeomagnetic dating as well as a seriation of ceramic types,                 it should be possible to establish a cultural chronology.                       Because both sites contain deeply stratified middens, they are                  well suited to this purpose.  Attention will also focus on                      metallurgical materials since preliminary work indicates that                   extensive smelting took place in this region.  Finally, sediment                cores will aid in the reconstruction of environmental change.                                                                                                   While much attention has focussed on Egypt and the Near East and                the role they played in the rise of civilization, the Sahelian                  region of Africa - the broad band just south of the Sahara Desert               - has been generally ignored.  However, work by the McIntoshes                  and others has indicated that essentially the same processes took               place in this area as well.  In their previous work in an                       adjacent region, the McIntoshes have traced the rise of large and               complex chiefly societies, and they have argued that this                       development is primarily indigenous.  This Middle Senegal Valley                project will explore a new geographical region and further                      examine the mechanisms involved.                                                                                                                                This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                fill a glaring geographical blank in the archaeological record.                 The data collected will be of great interest to a wide range of                 archaeologists.  Secondly, it will increase our understanding                   both of how complex societies develop and the role which sub-                   Saharan Africa played.  Because of the integral role which                      students will play, the project also contributes to the training                of future scientists.",
