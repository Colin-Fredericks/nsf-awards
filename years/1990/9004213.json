 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in convection heat transfer from arrays of discrete                    heat sources has been stimulated by rapid advancements in VLSI                  chip technologies and the attendant need for effective heat                     dissipation.  Recently, it has become clear that an important                   cooling option involves direct immersion of electronic                          components in a dielectric liquid, and considerable effort is                   being directed towards use of this option to dissipate large                    heat fluxes (> 100 W/cm2).  Such efforts typically involve                      single-phase forced convection and forced convection boiling,                   with measures for effecting heat transfer enhancement.                          However, it is believed that, in the quest for achieving                        larger levels dissipation with forced convection, insufficient                  attention is being given to moderate heat flux applications                     for which cooling with no imposed flow of the dielectric                        liquid is desirable, if not mandatory.  Such cooling schemes,                   involving either single-or two-phase thermosyphons, offer                       benign, passive conditions for which pumping requirements are                   eliminated, thereby reducing mechanical problems related to                     the hydrodynamic loads and vibrations induced by high speed                     flows.  High-powered desktop computers and workstations of the                  future would constitute an important application of this                        technology, since complex coolant distribution units cannot be                  used in such situations.                                                                                                                                        The proposed study seeks to assess means by which non boiling                   and boiling heat transfer from arrays of discrete sources may                   be enhanced for free convection in a cavity.  For heat sources                  with and without extended surfaces, experiments and numerical                   simulations will be used to establish a basic understanding of                                                                                                  related flow and thermal conditions and to determine operating                                                                                                  conditions which maximize heat transfer per unit package                        volume.  Heat transfer enhancement schemes to be considered                     include, but are not restricted to, low-profile studs, pin-fin                  arrays, longitudinal fin arrays, and porous fin arrays.                         Three-dimensional models, including the conjugate problem of                    substrate conduction, will be used for comparison with                          experimental results.  The work is expected to enhance                          understanding of basic flow and heat transfer associated with                   discrete sources in a dielectric liquid with particular                         attention to heat transfer enhancement schemes which maximize                   heat flux at low coolant volumetric flow rate and low coolant                   system volume.",
