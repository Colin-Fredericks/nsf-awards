 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynamics of the interstellar medium on small and intermediate               scale sizes is governed by energy injection from stars,                         particularly the ionizing radiation, winds, and supernova                       explosions of massive stars.  The evolution of ionized hydrogen                 regions, both around isolated massive stars and clusters of such                stars, in an inhomogeneous medium will examined by Dr. McKee.  The              dynamics and spectra of the remnants of supernovae which explode                in ionized hydrogen regions will be calculated, and the                         implications for the observed statistics of remnants assessed.                  Supernovae from a cluster of massive stars create a \"superbubble\"               in the interstellar medium; the dynamics of such structures will                be investigated, with applications both to the Galaxy and to                    starburst galaxies.  A powerful new hydrodynamics computer code                 will be used to address some fundamental problems in interstellar               gas dynamics posed by energy injection, including the interaction               of a blast wave with an interstellar cloud.  The spectra of                     interstellar shocks provide astronomers with essential diagnostic               tools for the study of the effects of stellar energy injection, and             a comprehensive attack on the structure of shocks in molecular gas              is planned.  Extensive calculations will develop the hypothesis                 that interstellar water masers are due to shocks in dense molecular             gas.                                                                                                                                                            Stars energize the interstellar medium through radiation and                    stellar wiinds during the star's life, and for some stars, through              supernova explosions at their death.  This energy is eventually                 radiated into intergalactic space, so the energization of the                   interstellar medium may be viewed as an energy flow which                       originates in stars in several forms, streams outward through the               interstellar medium, and finally leaves the Galaxy in the form of               radiation, cosmic rays, and in extreme cases, a wind.  One of the               central problems in interstellar astrophysics is to understand how              stellar energy injection produces the physical conditions and                   morphology of the interstellar medium, both in our Galaxy and in                other galaxies.  Dr. McKee's research will focus on energy                      injection by massive stars, which dominates the energy injection                into the interstellar medium.",
