 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary interest of Dr. Bleil's laboratory is analysis of                   mammalian fertilization at the molecular level, combining                       techniques of biochemistry and molecular genetics. Studies                      proposed here are designed to determine which of two identified                 mouse sperm proteins functions as the ZP3 recognition protein:                  i.e., the sperm protein responsible for primary binding of mouse                sperm to the zone pellucida. In preliminary studies, a mouse                    sperm \"56K doublet\" protein having properties expected of the ZP3               recognition protein has been identified on the basis of affinity                chromatography and crosslinking studies. This protein will be                   further characterized biochemically. It has been proposed by                    others that a sperm galactose-binding protein related to                        asialoglycoprotein receptor functions as the mouse sperm protein                which recognizes ZP3. Studies described here are designed to                    determine whether this rat protein is related to the mouse sperm                56kD protein and, independently, whether an asialoglycoprotein                  receptor-related protein of mouse sperm has properties expected                 for the ZP3 recognition protein. The long term objectives of the                proposed study are 1) to identify and characterize mammalian                    sperm proteins (fertilization proteins\") which mediate                          interaction between sperm and egg at the level of the zona                      pellucida and 2) to determine, at the molecular level, how sperm                \"fertilization proteins\" interact with their counterparts in the                zone pellucida.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This work proposes to identify those molecules on sperm that are                responsible for recognition of receptors on the egg surface that                enable fertilization to take place.                                             %%%",
