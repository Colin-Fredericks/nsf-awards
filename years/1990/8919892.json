 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of cerebral cortical astrocytes will be studied                 in cultures from mice with three copies (aneuploidy) of                         chromosome 16 (MMU 16; Ts16).  Astrocytes have been increasingly                implicated in hormonal control of brain development and may                     possess some of the membrane excitability mechanisms normally                   characteristic of neurons.  The long term objectives are to                     determine the developmental consequences of autosomal trisomy in                mammals.  Astrocyte morphology, expression of glial specific                    antigens such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and                    expression of voltage-gated ion channels as determined by tracer                influx and radiolabeled ligand binding measurements will be used                to establish the state of astrocyte differentiation.  Conversion                to a stellate morphology of GFAP+ cells and appearance of                       voltage-gated sodium channels  with high affinity for saxitoxin                 are associated with astrocyte maturation in vitro.  Preliminary                 results reveal that this developmental program is accelerated in                Ts16 Astrocytes.  The proposed studies will investigate the                     nature of this acceleration maturation in Ts16 astrocytes and                   also examine whether growth factors trigger this premature aging.               These studies should provide new information about the roles of                 astrocytes and neuronal-glial interactions in normal brain                      development and how astrocyte development is altered by                         aneuploidy.",
