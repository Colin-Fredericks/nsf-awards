 "awd_abstract_narration": "This complements a recently-funded project to deply biweekly                    sediment traps for two years on the eastern and western sides of                the Gulf of California which will cover work on bulk fluxes,                    planktonic foraminifera, radiolaria and stable isotopes.  This                  study will concentrate on four preservable groups of                            phytoplankton microfossils--diatoms, silicoflagellates, dino-                   flagellates and calcareous nannofossils.  Fluxes of each taxon                  will be determined, and the composition of the trap-based                       material compared with that of underlying surface sediments                     recovered by box cores.  The study will examine the seasonal                    succession of phytoplankton, and the internannual and spatial                   variation thereof, in order to determine the degree to which the                original seasonal signal is preserved in the sediments.  Changes                in phytoplankton will be examined at 1000 year intervals                        throughout the cored section, on eastern and western sides, to                  address questions concerning changes in seasonal upwelling and                  evidence for changed precipitation and river runoff.  The study                 will expand upon a model being developed to describe the                        transformation of biocoenosis to taphocoenosis for diatoms, and                 produce a first-range model for calcareous nannofossils and                     silicoflagellates.",
