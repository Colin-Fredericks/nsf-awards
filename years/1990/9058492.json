 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary focus of the mathematical research of this                     Presidential Young Investigator will be on partial differential                 equations arising from geometrical problems.  The equations are                 typically nonlinear of elliptic and parabolic type.                                  One class of problems involves what is known as curve                      shortening.  The question is one of describing the long time                    behavior of a family of plane curves which evolve so that their                 normal velocity coincides with their curvature.  More complicated               situations arise when the normal velocity depends in a general                  way on the curvature and time; the latter case occurring in                     models of phase transitions in two dimensions.                                       The solution to a curve shortening problem has been shown to               develop singularities (blow-up) under certain circumstances.  The               asymptotic shape of the (suitably rescaled) singular part does                  not depend on the initial data.  Numerical simulations suggest                  that the actual blow-up rate of the curvature is a function of                  the iterated logarithm of time.  Work will be done in determining               if this observation is true and in seeking the mechanism                        responsible for the log-term in the estimate.                                        Work will also be done in determining periodic orbits with                 prescribed energy of Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles of                smooth compact surfaces.  The Hamiltonian is assumed to be convex               and even on each fibre.  A particular goal of the work is to                    establish the existence of periodic orbits on energy surfaces                   whose projections on the manifold intersect the projection of a                 given periodic orbit a prescribed number of times.  Such a result               may be regarded as a global analog of the Poincare-Birkhoff                     theorem.  Related work will study the linking of parts of                       solutions of Hamiltonian systems in two dimensions.  Estimating                 linking numbers can be viewed as analogous to measuring the                     number of roots of a scalar parabolic partial differential                      equation.",
