 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon monoxide and methane are important trace gases in the                    surface waters of the marine environment.  An understanding of                  the mechanisms by which these gases are produced and consumed                   is important to our understanding of carbon cycling in the                      world's oceans.  The chemolithotrophic ammonium oxidizing                       bacteria appear to play an important role in the consumption of                 these gases and thus represent an important link between the                    carbon and nitrogen production of CO and on the rate of                         ammonium and nitrite oxidation.  Microbial processes are                        hypothesized to play an important role in the formation of                      photochemically active species involved in CO production.  The                  objectives of this 3-year laboratory and field program are to:                  (1) examine the photochemical and photobiological sources and                   rates of CO production; and (2) examine the spatial and                         temporal distribution of CO, CH4, inorganic nitrogen,                           terrestrial and marine sources of photochemically active                        species, and trace gas consumption.  This research will provide                 information related to the coupling of the nitrogen and carbon                  cycles, the role of microorganisms in the formation and                         consumption of CO, the distribution of; CO, CH4, NH4+, NO-2,                    and NO3-, the organic sources of CO photoproduction and the                     wavelengths involved in CO photoproduction.",
