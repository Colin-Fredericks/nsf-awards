 "awd_abstract_narration": "The dynein ATPases are complex, multisubunit enzymes that generate         the forces for a variety of microtubule-based movements.  The function          of the different dynein subunits in the generation of motility is               largely unknown, but the study of mutants with defective flagellar              motility in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has identified several genes that         alter the structure and function of the outer dynein arm.  One of these         genes, the sup-pf-1 locus, is the structural gene for the B subunit of          the outer arm complex.  The mechanisms by which the B chain contributes         to dynein activity and flagellar motility will be studied by the                analysis of wild-type and mutant alleles of the sup-pf-1 locus.  The            specific aims are:  1) To characterize the microtubule binding and              translocation properties of wild-type and mutant B subunits by in vitro         assays.  2) To determine the physical locations of the microtubule              binding site (s) and the sup-pf-1 regulatory regions by photolytic and          proteolytic cleavage techniques.  3) To identify the position of                specific functional domains within the DNA sequence of the B chain gene,        and to characterize the DNA sequences in both mutant and wild-type              alleles.                                                                             This combined genetic, biochemical, and molecular approach will            provide new insights into the basic mechanisms of dynein-based motility.",
