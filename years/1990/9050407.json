 "awd_abstract_narration": "Distributed computing is an important aspect of many fields of                  computer science including architecture, operating systems,                     programming languages, data base management, algorithms, and                    artificial intelligence.  Undergraduates are usually introduced to              this subject in an operating systems course during a study of process           control and concurrency.  There is, however, a lack of programming              assignments which give students practical experience with these                 concepts within a single semester course.  This project establishes             a laboratory and develops an innovative laboratory curriculum which             can serve as a model for undergraduate operating systems courses in             other programs.  The laboratory is workstation-based and uses the               UNIX operating system in a windowing environment.  Fourteen                     workstations and a server have been purchased and networked.  A                 series of experiments and student projects based on virtual rings are           being implemented, and a laboratory manual is being produced which              describes student assignments covering most of the topics contained             in a standard operating systems course.  In addition, debugging tools           are being integrated with the windows to allow students to monitor              concurrent computations.                                                                                                                                        The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
