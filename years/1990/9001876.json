 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general area of analytical and surface                     chemistry and in the subfield of laser spectroscopy of liquid                   solid interfaces.  Professor Robert Corn will develop the                       theoretical and experimental description of monolayers of mixed                 molecular species at metal electrode interfaces.  The second                    harmonic generation and sum frequency generation methods                        developed by Professor Corn will be combined with infrared                      spectroscopic measurements of mixed monolayers of molecular                     species controlled by electrochemical potential on a metal                      electrode.  These studies will allow fuller understanding of                    the role of interfacial molecular structure on electron                         transfer processes which occur at these interfaces.  In                         addition, the methodology will allow more complete description                  of other liquid solid interfaces of import in a variety of                      chemical and technological processes.                                                                                                                           By combining second harmonic generation (SHG) on and off                        resonance analysis and theoretical description of the response                  using Pople-Pariser-Parr formalism to describe the molecular                    polarizability tensors, the first measurements of molecular                     orientation response in SHG have been made.  Professor Corn                     will extend these measurements in combination with infrared                     reflection absorption and sum frequency generation to fully                     characterize mixed monolayers of molecular species at single                    crystal electrode liquid interfaces.",
