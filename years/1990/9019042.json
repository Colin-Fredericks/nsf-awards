 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Chemistry Division supports a curriculum                      development project in the Chemistry Department at the                          University of Minnesota.  A team of department members will                     participate: Dr. W. Ronald Gentry, Department Chair; Dr. Marian                 T. Stankovich; Ms. Susan Damme; Dr. Paul Barbara; and Dr. Gary                  Gray.  The department will develop a program for retaining                      women students in graduate study.  Their plans include                          assessment of student needs, developmental programs, and local                  outreach programs.  A significant portion of the project                        involves development of \"modules\" for classroom use, which will                 be destributed to departments interested in adapting the                        program to their campuses.                                                                                                                                      The needs assessment component will continue research on the                    extent and complexity of cultural issues affecting women and                    minorities during graduate study.  Surveys and interviews of                    first-year students and members of research groups will be                      carried out in order to identify problems areas and determine                   the role of various means of student support, family                            responsibilities, and length of graduate study on student                       success rates.  Developmental programs include career                           counseling, development of career modules for classroom use,                    orientation and mentoring for new gradaute students, faculty                    development, interaction with professional organizations,                       travel grants for women and minority graduate students, and                     acquisition of libarary materials on careers and opportunities                  for women and minorities.  Graduate students will be involved                   in outreach activities in elementary and secondary schools.                     This is a multifaceted approach to retaining women and                          minorities in graduate study in chemistry.  Because of the                      interactive nature of graduate education, emphasis is placed on                 the educational environment.",
