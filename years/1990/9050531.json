 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid and continuing growth in the significance of the use of               nuclear magnetic resonance techniques in solving structural                     problems requires that a modern curriculum place considerable                   emphasis on both theory and practice in the area.  Through the                  acquisition of a high-field NMR spectrometer, the institution has               improved the course content in five laboratory courses offered in               the Chemistry Department:  Organic Chemistry I and II, Inorganic                Chemistry, Instrumental Analysis, and Senior REsearch.  The                     acquisition of the instrumentation has also resulted in                         improvements in the associated lecture portions of these courses.               The Gemini 200-RT system has been utilized to permit the                        introduction of new experiments into each of the laboratories and               to augment techniques available to undergraduate research                       participants.  The project has been of major significance because               it enabled the Chemistry Department to bring it curricular                      content to standards recognized by national consensus.",
