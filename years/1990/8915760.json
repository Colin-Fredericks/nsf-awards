 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at examining the partitioning of Th                      between the dissolved phase and various naturally occurring                     colloidal and suspended particulate surfaces.  This information                 will be used to examine in more detail the mechanisms of                        scavenging.  In particular, such measurements would allow for a                 separation of the processes of sorption onto particle surface                   from the aggregation and disaggregation of colloids and                         suspended particles.                                                            %%%                                                                             Increased analytical sensitivity is needed for the proposed Th-                 230 and Th-232 determinations, as traditional radiochemical                     analyses of these isotopes require thousands of liters of                       seawater.  It is proposed to develop techniques which utilize                   thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) for these analyses.                 Sub-liter (for Th-232) and 1-10 liter (for Th-230) natural                      seawater samples could thereby be used for this study.  A                       number of samples under differing particle regimes will be                      examined, ranging from vertical profiles in the open ocean, to                  coastal waters collected during periods of intense biological                   activity (spring and summer) and periods of physical                            resuspension (fall and winter).",
