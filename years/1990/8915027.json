 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extremely hard ceramics such as silicon nitride and silicon                     carbide have generated considerable interest in recent years                    as potential materials for many high-temperature engineering                    applications.  In their dense high-strength forms, these                        materials are being proposed for use as structural materials                    in power-generating gas turbines to increase their efficiency                   by allowing gas inlet temperatures to about 1400oC.  These                      materials are also being considered for automotive gas                          turbines, small thermal reactors, roller bearings, and                          advanced combustion chambers.                                                                                                                                   An important drawback to silicon compound ceramics is their                     extreme hardness, which makes their processing and shaping an                   extremely difficult, tedious and expensive procedure.                           Preliminary work has already shown that vastly higher removal                   rates are possible with a CO2 laser as compared to the                          conventional diamond grinding.  To demonstrate the feasibility                  of laser shaping of hard-to-machine materials, a multi-                         disciplinary research effort has been undertaken to study the                   basic mechanisms governing the interaction between a high-                      powered CO2-laser beam and silicon compound ceramics.  The                      research program is looking at the heat transfer, material                      property and manufacturing aspects of the laser-shaping                         process.  A heat transfer model is being established to                         predict shape and depth of single, multiple-pass and                            overlapping grooves, material removal rates, surface                            roughness, etc.  Material properties relevant for the model                     are being measured, including surface reflectivity (as                          function of temperature, angle and beam polarization), surface                  temperatures and ejected material properties (particle size                     and number density).  Material characteristics of the ceramics                  before and after laser treatment are being investigated, such                   as microstructure, chemical composition of elements on the                      surface, flexure strength an thermal shock resistance.  Laser                   machining is being carried out with variable operating                          conditions, and measurements are being made to determine                        quality, uniformity, reproducibility and predictability of the                  process.  Machining results from single and overlapping                         grooves are being used to validate the heat transfer model.",
