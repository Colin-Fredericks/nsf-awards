 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many kinds of mites and insects, including numerous pests of               crops and livestock, feed on only a single kind of plant or                     animal, or a few closely related kinds.  Sometimes genetic                      changes, including the origination of new species, produce a                    shift in the diet of these mites and insects, creating new pest                 problems.  The proposed work will investigate how a group of mite               species that feed on particular plants originated from ancestors                that fed on different kinds of plants.  In addition, the question               of why these mites are so specific in their feeding habits will                 be studied.  Because a great deal is already known about the                    ecology and behavior of this group of mites, a study of their                   genetic history is likely to be especially valuable to our                      understanding of basic principles of how mites and insects become               specialized in their feeding habits, and how these habits may                   change.",
