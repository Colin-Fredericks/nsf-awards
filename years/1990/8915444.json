 "awd_abstract_narration": "The great sensitivity of Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) detectors                  makes it possible to acquire large numbers of images at the                     telescope, and if care is taken, the quality of the photometry far              exceeds what can be done photographically.  On the other hand, the              development of high-speed digitizing equipment has also                         dramatically increased the quantity, if not the quality, of digital             data which can be generated from photographic plates.  For many                 types of work, CCD's have become the detector of choice, but there              are still projects for which photography is well-suited.  This                  dramatic change in the scale and precision of stellar photometry                has opened up new avenues for astronomical research: detailed                   comparisons of cluster color-magnitude diagrams with stellar                    evolution theory, determination of luminosity functions, and truly              large-scale surveys e.g., for problems in galactic structure,                   searches for variable stars, and new analyses of archival plates.               At Boston University, much of the needed software exists for doing              digital stellar photometry, but the combination of general growth               of the Astronomy Department and new projects in stellar photometry              is about to overwhelm the existing computing facilities.  This                  award will help complete the development of an integrated system                for CCD photometric reductions and digital photographic photometry.",
