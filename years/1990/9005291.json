 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pectins are major structural polysaccharides of the cell wall                   in higher plants and are of enormous complexity.  They have                     been thought to play a multiplicity of roles in the biology                     of the cell in connection with wall hydration, plasticity and                   cell adhesion.  Pectins also appear to be involved in plant                     defense responses.  This project will examine some of the                       detailed modifications in chemical structure of pectins that                    take place during cell growth.  Particular attention is to be                   paid to the specific type of esterification of uronic acid                      residues in maize cells and how this changes as the cells                       grow.  Evidence that the esterified galactosyluronic acid                       units cannot be completely accounted for by methyl esters                       leads to the need for further work to characterize more fully                   these esterified compounds.  This project is intended to                        elucidate details of esterification and how thesse may relate                   to polysaccharide interactions resulting from the pectin                        esterifications that are associated with cell enlargement.                                                                                                      The cell wall of higher plants is largely responsible for the                   support of plants and is a major determinant of the form of                     plants.  Plant cell walls comprise of a number of complex                       polymeric carbohydrates, including cellulose, hemicellulose                     and pectic compounds.  Pectic compounds are polymeric                           compounds consisting of a series of sugar-acids that are                        linked together in complex patterns.  These pectic compounds                    undergo subtle changes in their chemical structure during                       growth, and these changes may play an important role in                         determining how plant cells are able to grow in size.  In                       this project Dr. Carpita continues his detailed exploration                     of the chemistry of maize pectins, making use of state-of-                      the-art technology in fully characterizing these important                      compounds.***//",
