A                    CAD/CAM laboratory is created for use by all mechanical and                     aerospace students in conjunction with a required machine shop                  junior course and as part of the junior and senior independent                  work of many student.  By locating this laboratory in the central               student shop facility, the equipment will also be available to                  students in other departments, and be under the supervision of a                professional machinist charged with undergraduate instruction.                  This laboratory will build on CAD/CAM experience gained in the                  sophomore year involving real-time control, actuators and sensors, and          robotics.  This initial step will establish a laboratory with                   a three-dimensional CAD/CAM capability, network data transfer                   between work-stations and the machine controller, and a                         numerically controlled three-axis milling machine capable of                    fabricating full-scale components.  Other equipment will be                     acquired as experience is gained.",
