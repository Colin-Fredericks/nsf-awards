The conference will focus on                     recruitment and retention of women at the undergraduate and                     graduate student levels.  One of the important goals of the                     conference is to identify the attributes of departments that                    have been successful in attracting and keeping women in physics                 programs.  The invitees will include representatives of                         professional societies, physics faculty members, and female                     faculty from smaller institutions and women minority students                   will be especially encouraged.  Conference proceedings will be                  published and results of the conference will be discussed at                    the annual joint meeting of AAPT and APS in winter, 1991.",
