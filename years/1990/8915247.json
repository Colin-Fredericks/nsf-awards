 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S. scientists              in a joint seminar on \"Molecular Strategies of Pathogens and Host               Plants,\" to be held in Honolulu, HI, April 15-20, 1990.  The main               topics to be discussed are the pathogenicity of bacterial and fungal            pathogens, and mechanisms of defense of host plants.  In addition,              there will be overview presentations on recent biochemical and                  molecular research into host-pathogen interactions.  The co-                    organizers of the seminar are Professor Suresh S. Patil, Department             of Plant Pathology and Biotechnology Program, University of Hawaii,             and Professor Seiji Ouchi, Laboratory of Plant Pathology, Kinki                 University, Japan.  This meeting is the sixth in a series of U.S.-              Japan seminars beginning in 1966 on the physiology and biochemistry             of plant disease.  Each has been effective in promoting information             exchange and collaborative research between the two countries, as               well as contributing to general research progress in the field.                                                                                                 The U.S. and Japan are world leaders in the study of biochemical                and molecular determinants of plant-pathogen interactions.  Work                in this field is critical to an understanding of the factors that               regulate plant infection and disease resistance, and thus is of                 great importance in improving plant productivity.  The significant              progress that has occurred in both countries since the last                     seminar in 1985 in the elucidation of the molecular basis of                    microbe-host plant interactions makes this an opportune time to                 hold the seminar in order to review and discuss this progress.  As              with previous meetings in the series, this one will lead to the                 publication of a book based on the presented papers and discussion.",
