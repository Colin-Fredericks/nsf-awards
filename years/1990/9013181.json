 "awd_abstract_narration": "With its state-of-the-art submersibles and ROVs, Harbor Branch                  Oceanographic Institution (HBOI) is in a unique position to                     conduct biological research in deep midwater habitats and at                    continental shelf depth too great to reach by SCUBA.  The                       submersibles are used by scientists funded by NOAA, NSF, ONR,                   Seagrant and other agencies in addition to staff scientists.                    Because the two HBOI support ships, both have walk-in                           environmental facilities for maintaining deep-water organisms,                  specimens can be transported to port for additional work                        following cruises.  However, the institution's shore-based                      facilities for controlling temperature, pressure, spectral                      irradiance and other environmental parameters  are inadequate.                  To remedy this situation, the Division of Marine Science at HBOI                is currently renovation a laboratory to serve as a culture and                  experimental facility for work with midwater and bathyal                        organisms.  This facility, which has been given the acronym COOL                (Culture of Oceanic Organisms Laboratory) will allow researchers                to conduct shore-based physiological, behavioral, embryological                 and ecological research with organisms collected from deep                      waters.                                                                                                                                                         This project will provide partial funding for some of the capital               equipment needed to outfit the laboratory, namely environmental                 rooms, circulating water baths, and a small hyperbaric chamber                  with associated hardware.  The culture laboratory is to be                      located in the same building as a newly designated visiting                     investigator laboratory.  Both facilities will be available as                  common-use research space for graduate students, postdoctoral                   fellows, and staff scientist from the national and international                scientific community.",
