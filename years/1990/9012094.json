 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical models have become important to the routine                   functioning of commerce and government.  Models help with planning,             evaluating, managing and operating systems of all types.  With the              spread of personal computers, more models will be used by .. and                developed by .. more people.  Yet, even as society becomes more                 dependent on models, we have not given enough attention to the process          of model formulation, either in practice or in education.                            Model formulation is the first step in the modeling process:               moving from a vague sense of \"problem\" to a formal representation that          can be manipulated to yield solutions.  Improved, systematic methods of         model formulation are important to the development of \"modeling                 science\" that will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of modeling         efforts.                                                                             The objectives of this research are to:  (1) Describe the model            formulation process as practiced by acknowledged experts; (2) Develop           ways to judge the success of model formulation; (3) Suggest improved            procedures for model formulation.  This research will be exploratory,           and should pave the way for experimentally verifiable propositions              about effective model formulation.  It should also lead to improved             techniques and materials for educating modelers",
