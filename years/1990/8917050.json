 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mating-type (mt) locus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is a key                regulatory unit which appears to govern life-cycle transitions in               this simple eukaryote.  It consists of both regulatory and                      structural genes maintained as a unit by  recombinational                       suppression.  Possibly it shares functional homologies with loci                that govern embryological transitions in the metazoa and/or higher              plants.  The long-term objective of this research is to understand              how mt works.  As a first step, it is critical that the locus be                defined at a molecular level.  A cloned cDNA has been isolated                  which exhibits tight genetic linkage to the mating-type locus and               is uniquely expressed within 10 min after gametes undergo cell                  fusion to form zygotes.  Genomic clones homologous to this probe                have been identified, and a \"chromosome walk\" has identified-300                kb of cloned DNA to either side of the gene.  Three lines of                    experimentation are proposed.  The first entails generation of                  deletions in diploid strains that cover known recessive mutations               linked to mt; such deletions will provide physical landmarks in the             walk and may also identify the loci of particular genes.  The                   second entails an attempt to overcome the recombinational                       suppression in the region by sporulating diploids homozygous at mt;             any recombinants between the mt-linked markers will again provide               physical landmarks and provide a long-sought genetic map of the                 region.  Finally, the recent cloning of homologous selectable genes             and their successful use in Chlamydomonas transformation (reported              by 3 independent labs) will permit us to attempt co-transformation              of the mt-linked mutations using sectors of the existing walk and,              if necessary, extensions of the walk.  Putative transformants will              be verified by genetic and molecular analysis.  Clones certifiably              transformed for interesting genes related to mating-type functions              will be further analyzed:  the relevant sector of the transforming              DNA will be identified and sequenced to look for sequence motifs                suggestive of DNA binding proteins, kinases, nucleases, and so on.              The presence/absence/modification of each gene in the chromosome                of the opposite mt can also be ascertained.  In future years, the               activities of these genes in gamete differentiation and zygote                  development can be assessed in detail.                                                                                                                          This study of basic reproduction in the model organism,                         Chlamydomonas, will provide information about genetic recombination             and regulation.  Chlamydomonas is of particular interest to plant               biologists because it carries out photosynthesis.  Understanding                of fundamental processes in this organism can frequently be                     transferred and applied to higher plants.",
