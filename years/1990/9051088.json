 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to enhance the educational opportunities             available to students and to increase the instructional efficiency              of the courses. A video microscopy system is being used to                      demonstrate microscopic specimens and to teach microscopy                       techniques. The macroscopic capabilities of the system are used to              identify anatomical structures and illustrate dissection                        techniques. An environmental chamber enables students to examine                effects of environmental factors on biological processes. Ecology               study chambers allow students to observe intractions between                    organisms in an controlled environment and to perform pollution                 studies. Spectrophotometers are used for hemoglobin determination,              enzyme kinetics, and water quality testing. Computers are used with             the video microscopy system to allow students to observe structures             and techniques at their own pace, to quiz themselves at their own               pace, and to design an interactive audiovisual presentation with                video discs. This equipment allows students to engage in a wide                 variety of laboratory exercises and enhances the efficiency of                  laboratory instruction. The college is contributing an amount equal             to the award.",
