 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question of the prebiotic source of pyrophosphate will                 be pursued along two lines.  One is the possibility of continuous               formation in nature by condensation under high temperature acidic               hydrothermal conditions and subsequent concentration in reactive                minerals.  The other involves the action of condensation agents,                such as cyanide derivatives in an environment where such agents                 may be concentrated together with orthophosphate ion.  Since the                source components of RNA; cyanide, phosphate and carbonate (as a                precursor of aldehydes) are all anionic, minerals with anion                    exchange capacity are our prime choice for study as potential                   concentrators and hosts for these components, and as catalysts                  for their further reaction.  Possible and likely paths for                      prebiotic phosphorylation of sugar precursor molecules require                  condensed phosphates as driving agents, and, as substrates, the                 simplest possible achiral ester forming hydroxyl compounds, such                as condensation products of formaldehyde, the latter known to                   form by photochemical and plasma processes.  Also in this branch                of the investigation, the selective concentrating power and the                 catalytic aid of anion sorbing transition metal hydroxide                       minerals will be explore.  The third part of the study connects                 to current research on non-enzymatic oligomerization of RNA by                  exploring the concentration, ordering, and catalytic reaction of                evolved nucleotides such as AMP and nucleotide phosphates (ADP,                 ATP) in the anion exchanging pyroaurite minerals.                                    This project is a part of a larger program, that aims at                   demonstrating environmentally plausible processes leading from                  simple organic and inorganic molecules in highly dilute aqueous                 solution via selective concentration, ordering and reaction on                  mineral substrates, to the formation of molecular complexes of                  prebiotic interest.  The present proposal is concerned with the                 now unknown processes of original formation, concentration and                  esterification of condensed phosphate (diphosphate,                             pyrophosphate).",
