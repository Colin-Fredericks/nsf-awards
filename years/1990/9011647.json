 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies with microbial systems have shown that                           perfluorocarbon (PF)-emulsions can increase the oxygen                          transfer rate and increase the growth and/or amount of                          harvested bioproduct.  More recently, attempts have been                        made to develop useful PF microcarriers using F-emulsions.                      These microcarriers provide an enormous increase in                             surface area.  It has been known for some time that                             anchorage  dependent cells grow well on fluorocarbon                            surfaces.  A new technique has been developed by DuPont                         that makes it possible to fix specific proteins to a                            fluorocarbon surface.  This technique has the potential to                      provide droplets with important and specific factors                            necessary for different cells to adhere to a surface, and                       makes it possible to provide better aeration.  The PIs                          have done some preliminary studies using a purified                             fraction of high molecular weight gelatin, bovine serum                         albumin (BSA) as a model protein, and perfluorodecalin as                       the recipient fluorocarbon.  Gelatin                                            has been successfully tested for growth with BHK cells.                         This                                                                            project will be directed towards purifying the                                  perfluorodecalin, preparing beads that are more stable,                         and conducting preliminary oxygen mass transport studies.                       Successful completion of this project will open the way to                      developing PF microcarriers with special adhesion factors,                      and optimal gas exchange for cells adhering to the PF                           microcarriers.",
