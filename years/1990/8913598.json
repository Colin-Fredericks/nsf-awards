 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two year program to share facilities and              researchers to carry out complementary work on the use of high                  performance computing and networking for computer integrated                    manufacturing.  The investigators are Dr. H. T. Kung, Carnegie-                 Mellon University and Dr. Peter Dew and Alan DePennington,                      Department of Mechanical Engineering, Leeds University, England.                Professor Kung and his group are at the forefront of the most                   promising areas of high performance network parallel computer                   systems.  Dr. DePennington and Dew lead an internationally                      recognized, cross-disciplinary research program in mechanical                   engineering and computer science.                                                                                                                               This project will focus on the following specific tasks:  1)                    Continue the development of application programming by benchmarking             the Meiko Computing Surface against CMU machines, and investigate               the potential use of AL within the analysis phase of the product                life cycle 2) Investigate the issue of portability of software                  between diverse parallel machines and develop tools to aid this                 process and computers.  Both research groups have complementary                 research programs.  Through this project, the Leeds group will                  improve their understanding of CIM requirements for exploiting                  parallel computation; the CMU group will gain application insight               into the characteristics of high performance networked parallel                 architectures and requirements for future software environments.",
