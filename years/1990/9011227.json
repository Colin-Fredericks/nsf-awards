 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing demand for high speed real-time signal and image processing         has led to many new parallel architectures.  Among these systolic arrays        is an important class of parallel architectures that has played a               significant role in the VLSI implementation of algorithms of these              applications.  Since systolic arrays are algorithmic specific, it is            essential to develop methods for the synthesis and automatic mapping of         algorithms onto these arrays.  Work by other researchers has addressed          the synthesis problem based on uniform recurrence equations (URE) or            equivalent specifications of algorithms.                                                                                                                        Local communication is an essential factor for effective realization of         systolic arrays.  However, compared to global communication it requires         extra delays which reduce the computation time.  Particularly, for many         fine-grain operations where the PE has a simple structure the additional        delay for the transmission of data becomes restrictive.  Furthermore,           many algorithms can not be directly transformed to UREs or may not              exhibit the property of locality.  The locality restriction can be              solved by using Multi-Rate Arrays (MRA).  These arrays transmit the data        in a multi-rate fashion and can be used for many DSP and matrix                 computations resulting in speed up over systolic arrays.                                                                                                        In this project we extend previous design methods for systolic arrays           to MRAs in several directions.  First, we further develop our recent            results on the synthesis of MRAs and obtain a formal procedure for the          design automation of MRAs.  Secondly, we investigate the application of         MRAs to DSP and image processing algorithms.  This includes a thorough          comparison of MRAs with local broadcast (systolic,) bounded-broadcast,          and global broadcast arrays in terms of speedup, efficiency,                    architecture complexity, number of data paths, and VLSI chip area.",
