 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the effects                   of amino acid mutations on the fluctuation properties of T4                     phage lysozyme (T4L) proximate to the active site cleft.                        Dr. Hudson will focus on mutations of minimal perturbation as                   regards size change, and will perform constrained molecular                     dynamics calculations beginning with either an x-ray or a                       predicted crystal structure.  A component of the research                       plan involves using the extensive data base of T4L mutant                       structures to further extend the ability to test structure                      predictive techniques.  The importance of particular networks                   of nonbonded interactions in determining the overall dynamics                   of the region proximate to tryptophan 138, the fluorescence                     probe in the experimental work, as well as that of the active                   site itself will be probed.  The complex decay of the                           fluorescence of the single tryptophan of T4L mutant forms and                   other single tryptophan proteins will be analyzed.  The                         development of models will be guided by the results of                          dynamics simulations.  The juxtaposition of experiments and                     calculations will establish the nature of large  amplitude                      tryptophan dynamics on the interior of a protein.  The                          previous simulation work on T4 phage lysozyme to include a                      realistic solvent environment will be extended.  Finally free                   energy perturbation methods will be applied to determine the                    free energy differences for series of common                                    structural/conformational changes observed in several room                      temperature simulations of mutant T4L.  This will provide an                    enthalpic/entropic decomposition of the thermodynamic driving                   forces associated with the enhanced fluctuations gating the                     transition.  The nature of nonbonded interactions in mutant                     proteins will be compared with the thermodynamic properties                     and fluctuation correlation functions to glean general                          principles.",
