The workshop will be held on June 18-20 in the Iowa                 House in Iowa City, Iowa.  The workshop will address the                        following items: the basic statistics course; integration of                    statistical methods in other courses; collections of projects and               case studies; reasonable balance among teaching, consulting, and                research for faculty; and long range efforts in attracting more                 students to science and mathematics through statistical thinking.               The work shop will produce a document consisting of                             recommendations; this document will appear in the American                      Statistician, and its existence will be mentioned in publications               of the MAA and the NCTM.  The members of the workshop will be                   made-up of a large cross section of people from academia,                       industry, and government interested in statistics education.",
