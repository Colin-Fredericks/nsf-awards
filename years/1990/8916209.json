 "awd_abstract_narration": "This equipment grant will allow the acquisition of an automated                 carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur analyzer to be used primarily in an                ongoing program of oceanic tracer and flux analyses at Rice                     University.  The oceanic pathways of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur               are indicators of significant biogeochemical processes with global              implications, and have assumed crucial positions in developing                  studies of global change.  This system will replace an almost                   thirty-year old instrument that can no longer be overhauled or                  kept in operating condition, and will greatly expand the                        institutional research capabilities by allowing the analysis of                 much smaller samples than had heretofore been possible.  No                     equivalent instrument is presently available on the Rice                        University campus, and the new system will support the efforts of               approximately six research groups at Rice University and at the                 University of Houston.  Rice University is committed to providing               50% of the total cost of the new instrumentation in a matching                  grant.",
