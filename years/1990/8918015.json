 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is important to understand how particles which are formed in                 the upper layers of the ocean are transformed as they sink out                  of those upper layers into the benthos.  Bacteria play a major                  role in the transformation of the particles on their way to the                 bottom.  Much of the organic matter associated with these                       particles is converted to the dissolved state, a form in which                  it can be utilized by phytoplankton and other bacteria for                      growth.  Dr. Azam's previous results have led to the hypothesis                 that the attached bacteria, via secretion of certain enzymes                    (hydrolases) into the particle, are responsible for large scale                 solubilization and fragmentation of the particles.  The result                  is that most of the dissolved organic material diffuses out of                  the particle and is utilized by free-living bacteria.  In the                   present study, the magnitude and mechanisms of this pathway are                 explored.  The research focuses on the regulation of several                    enzymes that control the transformation from the particulate to                 the dissolved state.  The study contributes toward the                          understanding of the role of bacteria in biogeochemical cycling                 pathways of organic matter.",
