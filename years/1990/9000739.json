 "awd_abstract_narration": "An REU Site Program is proposed that will offer a wide variety of               opportunities of approximately 10 students to perform research on a             broad range of mechanical engineering topics during a 9-week summer             period.  National advertising of the program and selection procedures           to be used as an integral part of the program will maximize the                 possibility of attracting top students nationally, including students           who are women, handicapped, members of minority groups.  Students               selected for the program will have the opportunity of choosing a                summer project from a wide range of topics that encompass virtually             the complete realm of mechanical engineering.  Specific topics are              scheduled to be directed by faculty members with a specialty in that            specific areas and who are active in research in those topics.  The             students will be encouraged to enroll in an optional credit course for          their work.  Supplemental programs, such as fundamentals of shop                practice, instrumentation, and computer and computer graphics use,              will be available to participants who do not have that background.  An          integral thrust of the program is a seminar series that includes the            students presentation of their research plans (after approximately one          week on the program) and their results (at the end of the program).  A          formal written report will be required of each student summarizing              their efforts.  In all cases, attempts will be made to have the                 students work publishable in the technical press.  Based on past                experience with similar programs, it is anticipated some of the                 student work will, in fact, be publishable and that a large number of           these students will go on to graduate school.  Research areas involve           engineering design, control theory, fluid mechanics, heat transfer              applied mechanics of composite and manufacturing.",
