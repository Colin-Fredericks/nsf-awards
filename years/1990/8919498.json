 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the accuracy and speed with which                people can retrieve material from memory; its aim is to account                 for dissociations between different kinds of performances which                 depend primarily on short-term memory.  The aspects of short-                   term memory performance on which the research will focus include                the accuracy with which people can retrieve memorized materials                 when they are asked to recognize them (studied via forgetting                   functions), the speed with which they can retrieve such materials               (studied via reaction time or scan time), and the accuracy with                 which they can produce memorized materials when asked to recall                 them (studied via ordered recall or span).  These measures are                  sensitive to differences in materials and between individuals.                  Though analysis of individual differences in performances in                    problem solving, reading, etc., shows that short-term memory is                 one good predictor of these performances, the various measures                  can show odd dissociations.  For  example, retrieval times and                  production in recall show related dependence on materials, but                  individuals whose performance is above average on one measure may               not be above average on the other.  This research will test a                   precise quantitative model of short-term memory performance.  The               core of the model is short-term forgetting, fairly directly                     measured by forgetting functions.  Experiments will show whether,               as the model suggests, retrieval time is tied primarily to speed                of forgetting, while production or recall also is strongly                      affected by initial efficiency in learning.  Experiments will                   outline the relations between the three aspects of short-term                   memory within individuals for different materials, including                    characters and words, both controlled and uncontrolled for                      phonemic complexity, and geometric and graphical items.  The                    project aims to produce an accurate model to account for the                    common materials effects, explain the dissociation in measures                  for the individual, and to suggest how the various short-term                   memory measures should be interpreted with respect to their role                in different kinds of mental tasks.  Because of the dependence of               so many tasks on short-term memory, the results of this research                will bear on issues such as reading, problem solving, and                       decision making, as well as on education in these tasks.",
