 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding what controls the location of the channel head in a               valley network is crucial to predicting drainage density, and the               response of landscapes to changes in climate, landuse, and base                 level.  Recent studies of channel head locations in semi-arid to                humid landscapes have suggested that for a given area, channel                  heads are found progressively farther downslope, hence draining a               larger area, in gentler valleys.  Theories for channel initiation               are few and are severely limited by a lack of detailed field                    observations on runoff and erosion processes that can be used to                motivate and test physics-based equations.  We propose to conduct               field experiments by monitoring runoff and erosion during natural               and artificial rainstorms in gentle and steep gradient                          unchanneled valleys.  We will use results from these experiments                to test and extend available models for runoff generation and we                will couple with these models with erosion theories to predict                  channel head locations.  Work will be carried out at sites in                   California and Oregon where we have active research field                       programs in hydrologic and geomorphic processes.  The work                      proposed here is also an essential stepping stone toward                        formulating a theory for landscape evolution by valley                          development.",
