 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cassidy will use this award, made through the Small Grants                  for Exploratory Research program, to experimentally test the                    hypothesis that certain minerals found in meteorites could have                 grown metastably.  Laboratory equipment and facilities for these                studies are available at the Westinghouse Science and Technology                Center in Pittsburgh.                                                                                                                                           Diamonds and SiC grains have recently been identified in most                   classes of primitive stony meteorites.  These materials probably                condensed in the crystalline state from vapor.  They may not have               crystallized under equilibrium conditions, however.  The                        possibility of metastable crystal growth has been raised by the                 discovery that crystalline diamond can be produced artificially                 in a plasma at very low pressures and moderate temperatures.                    Other high temperature minerals occur in primitive meteorites                   and, by analogy, these may also have grown metastably.  Dr.                     Cassidy's research will explore the metastable growth of these                  minerals.  If the research is successful, certain assumptions                   about the condensation theory of cosmic dust grains will have to                be reexamined.",
