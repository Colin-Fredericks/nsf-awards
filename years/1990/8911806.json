 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project begins exploratory research in the philosophical                   foundations of conservation biology.  It involves careful review                of the appropriate philosophical literature and of biological work              on the relationship between stability and diversity for ecological              preservation.  Two related papers will result; one will discuss the             special role of values in conservation biology, given its status                as a science with a prescriptive goal, and one will examine and                 evaluate various definitions of \"ecosystem health.\"  The thesis                 that will be explored is that conservation biology will need to                 integrate insights from both its experimentalist and naturalist                 traditions, and from philosophical explorations of the role of                  values in science, in order to succeed in its goal of preserving                and protecting nature.  With the assistance of three advisors                   representing different biological perspectives, the investigator                will examine the implications of applying a recent theoretical                  approach -- systems or heirarchy theory -- to conservation biology.             Philosophical analysis of this approach may provide a frame of                  reference within which to satisfy both normative and objectivist                concerns in science; it may allow insights from naturalists to be               integrated with scientific data gathered by experimentalists.                                                                                                   This project is undertaken by a well-qualified and productive                   researcher with appropriate contacts and support in the research                communities he proposes to study.  Institutional support is                     adequate.  Results are likely to advance our understanding of the               role of values in science in general, and in conservation biology               in particular.  Questions about the relationship between science                and values, and between science, preservation of environment and                environmental values are of considerable interest to Ethics and                 Values Studies in Science, Technology and Society.  Given the                   project's merit, it has high priority for support.",
