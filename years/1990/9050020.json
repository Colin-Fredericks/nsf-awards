The mathematics core will consist                     of a new two-semester sequence guided by the NCTM standards.                    Both the mathematics and science courses will utilize                           manipulatives and laboratory work and will emphasize inquiry                    oriented and activity based learning.  The mathematics and                      science methods courses will be coordinated with the content                    courses.  Faculty from mathematics and the sciences will                        collaborate with faculty from the school of education in                        establishing and evaluating the program.  The University of                     Wisconsin--Milwaukee is one of the Project 30 institutions, a                   three-year project to redesign teacher education curricula.                     The Center for Teacher Education at UWM has been designated                     as a Center for Excellence in the UW system, and the Center                     has forged strong ties with the Milwaukee business and                          education community for the recruitment of minorities and the                   promotion of science and math education and literacy in the                     Milwaukee public schools.   The university's cost sharing                       will be 39% of NSF's contribution.",
