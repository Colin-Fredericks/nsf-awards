 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most difficult areas of experimental heat transfer                                                                                                   is that of determining the thermal response of solid surfaces                                                                                                   placed inside the flow to highly non-steady fluctuations in                     temperature, pressure, velocity, etc.  In recent years, very                                                                                                    sophisticated computer codes have been developed which are                      capable of analyzing such flows, but typically, they involve                                                                                                    some semi-empiricism.  Experimental validation of these non-                                                                                                    steady codes is therefore of great importance.  However, the                                                                                                    progress of experimental techniques has not kept pace with                      such computational developments, and much work is needed to                     provide such validation.  One area where non-steady effects                     are                                                                             of great importance is the area of turbo-machinery where high                   non-steadiness is produced by rotor-stator flow interactions,                   shock wave generation, turbulence, blade-boundary layer                         interaction, and the like.   The Axial Flow Turbine Facility                    at                                                                              Penn State with its instrumentation in the rotor frame of                       reference is uniquely equipped to attempt such validation.                                                                                                      The innovation of the proposed research is to attempt to                        simulate non-steady heat transfer in a turbo-machine by                         introducing a slug of high temperature air flow at a                            relatively small segment of the periphery of the turbo-                         machine,                                                                        over a very small increment of time.  If the simulation proves                                                                                                  valid, then the experimental study of non-steady transfer                       characteristics in turbo-machines will be greatly simplified,                                                                                                   and lead to relatively rapid progress in this important field.                                                                                                  In addition, fundamental information on non-steady heat                         transfer                                                                        will emerge from this study.",
