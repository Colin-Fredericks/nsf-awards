 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will initiate a study of multiple               self-intersecting closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces.  This                will include an investigation into a systematic method for                      determining the existence of permanent triple points.  The method               involves the application of trace identities between matrices in                SL(2,C) representing hyperbolic isometries.  Trace polynomials                  will also be used.                                                                   Geodesics, which may lie along surfaces, are generalizations               of the concept of a straight line.  The great circles are the                   geodesics on a sphere.  These are called closed geodesics because               they eventually retrace themselves.  For many years, geometers                  have studied the problem of classifying and counting the numbers                of closed geodesics on other surfaces such as the torus. The                    principal investigator's project is related to this continuing                  study.",
