Mr. Stone will collaborate with Dr. Hiroshi Hotta and others at                 JAMSTEC in defining critical research areas requiring in situ                   experimentation or sampling at ocean depths in excess of 4,000                  meters.  The submersible system and types of instrumentation and                tools that would be needed to accomplish deep-sea science programs              will be assessed.                                                                                                                                               JAMSTEC is the Japanese counterpart to NURP and, as an organization,            has as its mission the promotion of marine science research and the             development of technologies to facilitate that research.  In 1989               JAMSTEC launced the SHINKAI 6500, one of the deepest diving manned              submergence research vessels in the world.  NURP and JAMSTEC have a             history of collaboration.  Mr. Stone's research stay in Japan should            help to focus and coordinate future collaboration between the marine            science communities of our two countries.",
