 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms allocate resources to a variety of activities,                  such as reproduction, growth, and maintenance, and it is                        generally perceived that the allocation of resources to any one                 activity occurs at the expense of the other activities.  Plants                 provide an excellent opportunity to determine how resource                      allocation strategies are affected by the sex of an individual,                 as many genera contain species that vary in their sex expression.               Within the genus Silene, there are species that are                             hermaphroditic (both sexes in one individual) and others that are               dioecious (separate male and female individuals).                                    It has been shown for one of the dioecious species of Silene               that males and females have very different resource allocation                  patterns.  Dr. Delph's long-term research plans include                         investigating how these differences evolved.  In order to do so,                it is necessary to unambiguously determine the sex of plants                    early in their development.  At the present time, the sex of an                 individual can only be determined when it is flowering.  The                    grant will provide necessary funds to develop molecular                         techniques that would enable sex determination prior to                         flowering.  In addition, a protocol for a technique will be                     developed to detect differences between the sexes in where                      resources for flowering and fruiting originate within the plant.",
