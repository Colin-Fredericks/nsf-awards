 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range objective of this project is to understand how                   subpopulations of neural crest cells differentiate into specific                types of mature neurons during embryonic development.  What                     genetic and other factors are at work?  Dr. Barald and her                      coworkers have identified subpopulations of cells in the neural                 crest of chick and quail embryos with different biochemical                     properties.  They have developed markers for these different                    subpopulations and techniques for separating these cell types                   while keeping them alive.  They can now grow these subpopulations               in culture and characterize their responses to a variety of                     regulatory factors as well as to examine the interaction of                     various genes important in cellular differentiation.  By                        employing these methods, Dr. Barald's group will be able to                     answer the following questions:  When does a neuronal population                that is derived from the neural crest become determined, and                    therefore segregated from other cells in the crest lineage?  Is                 the expression of the determined state plastic?  Can it be                      modified by environmental cues in vivo or in vitro?",
