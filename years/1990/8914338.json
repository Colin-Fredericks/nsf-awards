 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in nuclear physics                     to be conducted by Stuart Pittel of the Bartol Research                         Institute at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware                     collaborating with Alberto Etchegoyen of the National                           Commission on Atomic Energy and Pedro Federman of the                           University of Buenos Aires, both in Buenos Aires, Argentina.                    Also participating will be Richard Casten of Brookhaven                         National Laboratory and Jonathan Engel, a postdoc at Bartol.                    The research will focus on two important contemporary                           problems in nuclear structure theory.  One is a systematic                      study of neutron-proton monopole-monopole effective inter-                      actions with the goal of obtaining a simple form for this                       important component of the effective nuclear force, valid                       over the whole range of elements.  The other is to develop a                    new approach to nuclear shell model calculations to be                          applied to a study of the shape transitions which occur in                      the neutron-rich strontium-zirconium-molybdenum region of the                   periodic table.                                                                                                                                                 The current work builds on previous collaborations resulting                    in ten publications with the Latin American scientists in                       this proposal and twelve more with others.  The earlier focus                   of cooperative research with Dr. Federman was on the                            development of a unified shell model of nuclear deformation.                    The new work will add an international dimension to active                      research.",
