 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hemoglobin acts as a receptor for a variety of small                            molecular weight compounds.  Some of these have potential as                    anti-sickling agents or agents that promote delivery of                         oxygen, but so far their practical application has foundered                    on their strong affinity for serum albumin.  The                                stereochemistry of binding of these molecules to the recently                   solved structure of serum albumin will be explored with a view                  to modifying their structure so as to lower their affinity for                  albumin without lowering the affinity for hemoglobin.                           Work on the binding of potential anti-sickling compounds to                     hemoglobins has led to the finding that these compounds seek                    out niches in the protein that fit their van der Waals shape,                   and that within those niches the compounds arrange                              themselves so as to maximize the electrostatic interaction                      between drug and protein.  Recent experience has shown that                     this rule is far from sufficient to allow us to predict where                   these molecules will bind to different sites in the protein.                    Most receptors are large membrane proteins of as yet unknown                    structure.  Hemoglobin is an ideal model receptor for exploring                 the rules that govern small molecular to proteins.                              Human globin can now be made in E.coli.  This has opened the                    way to directed mutagenesis of hemoglobin, and this will                        allow an exploration of the evolution of the hemoglobin                         structure and  of its specialized functions in different                        species.                                                                                                                                                        One possible strategy towards the prevention of sickling                        would be inhibition of the phosphoglyceromutase that converts                   1,3- to 2,3- diphosphoglycerate.  Horseradish peroxidase is                     widely used in diagnostic tests and could be adapted to more                    uses by directed mutagenesis, but its structure is unknown.                     Efforts are under way to determine the structures of both                       these proteins.",
