 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S..Hungary cooperative research                 project between Dr. Joseph P. Kennedy of the University of Akron                and Dr. Tibor Kelen of the Kossuth Lajos University, Debrecen,                  Hungary is to study the effects of process variables in the                     preparation of telechelic polyisobu\u001atylenes.  Relative telechelic               polymer yield, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution               will be determined through fundamental kinetic studies.  Results                should contribute to a second objective of synthesising \"perfect\"               and mixed polyisobutylene.based rubbery networks which may be                   suitable for studying a number of follow.on questions pertaining to             the theory of rubber elasticity and bimodal networks.                                                                                                           This project in polymer research fulfills the program objective of              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in the               United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents               and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and              competence.  In addition to new knowledge of elastomeric networks,              collaborative efforts under this project are also expected to yield             sufficient inventories of new polymers for use by polymer physicists            and engineers in subsequent research.",
