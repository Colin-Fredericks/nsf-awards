 "awd_abstract_narration": "All mathematical ideas must be expressed in some notation,                 and the most basic notation of all is the system of number names                a language uses.  When children learn to count, they must develop               basic mathematical concepts at the same time that they figure out               the rules of the particular system of number names they are                     learning.  Because languages vary in the way they represent                     numbers, it is possible to study how linguistic and cultural                    variation affects the development of mathematical competence.                   This research will study relations between the linguistic                       structure of number-naming systems and children's developing                    mastery of counting and basic arithmetic.                                            The research will produce a model of children's                            representation of number and how it is affected by the structure                of number-naming systems by looking at how children learn to                    count in Chinese and English.  Some experiments will examine the                origins of counting in very young children (2.5 years old), to                  see whether this fundamental mathematical skill varies before the               point where the number systems begin to differ.  Also included                  will be a longitudinal study of counting, to describe whether                   impasses and plateaus in learning to count differ across the two                countries.  Other experiments will examine how specific features                of the number systems affect children's acquisition of particular               concepts.  For example, Chinese forms ordinal numbers (such as                  first, second, third, etc.( by using a regular prefix (di') in                  front of the cardinal number, in contrast to the irregular system               of ordinal numbers that English has (first, second, third,                      fourth, etc.).  The research will examine the role this                         linguistic structure plays in children's learning the conceptual                distinction between ordinal and cardinal numbers.  Finally, the                 research will include a study on the development of mental                      arithmetic in Chinese and American children.  Previous research                 shows that Chinese children outperform their American peers on a                variety of mathematical skills.  This research should allow the                 precise description of which aspects of arithmetic skill account                for these substantial differences.                                                   The poor performance of American children on a wide array of               mathematical tasks makes understanding the basis for the                        advantages Chinese children show a question of obvious practical                significance.  These questions are of basic scientific interest                 as well, because an adequate model of the development of                        mathematical competence must be able to account for the                         performance of both groups of children.  Understanding the                      cognitive bases for large differences between American and                      Chinese children is an essential step in figuring out what the                  implications of these differences are for understanding and                     promoting cognitive development.",
