 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South Turkana Ecosystem Project (STEP) is a long-term,                 interdisciplinary ecosystem-oriented study of Ngisonyoka Turkana                pastoral nomads and their interactions with a dry                               savanna/woodland ecosystem in Northern Kenya.  The initial                      objective of STEP in the early 1980s was to determine how                       Ngisonyoka pastoralists, with only their traditional technology,                managed to survive and persist in a dry and drought-stressed                    ecosystem, in the midst of rampant banditry and inter-tribal                    warfare.  Over the last ten years the project has conducted a                   number of studies on landscapes, vegetation, livestock, and                     people.  The project team will now perform research-synthesis                   phase of two years duration for the purpose of pulling together                 and synthesizing the results of the diverse disciplinary studies                around ecosystem level concepts or particular issues that have                  arisen during the course of the work.  By integrating the results               of field and modeling work around important issues and concepts                 it is expected that the group will (1) demonstrate that studies                 of human ecology, biology and society can be integrated into                    ecosystem science; (2) show that it is feasible to incorporate                  climate studies, ecosystem analyses, and social science within a                single investigatory and modeling framework; (3) provide several                new insights into the structure and dynamics of dry tropical                    ecosystems and, most importantly; (4) present a holistic portrait               of the ecology of pastoral nomads, their biological, social, and                resource exploitation strategies, and their interactions with                   their ecosystem.",
