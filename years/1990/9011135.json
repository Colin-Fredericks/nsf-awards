 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Loma Prieta Earthquake of 17 October 1989                                   represents an exogenous shock to the economic                                   markets in the San Francisco Bay area.  As                                      such we would expect a set of short                                             (transitory, lasting less than 6 months) and                                    long (persistent, exceeding one year) term                                      impacts to result.  The objective of this                                       research is to assess these impacts, to                                         measure their initial magnitude and their                                       propensity to persist into the future.  Two                                     potential impacts are considered: (i) the risk                                  perceptions of citizens of the San Francisco                                    Bay area; and (ii) the housing market.  The                                     study area consists of the counties of                                          Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Cruz,                                   Santa Clara, Marin, and San Francisco (areas                                    both damaged and undamaged by the earthquake).                                                                                                                  The outputs of the research will be fourfold.                                   First, through analysis of the individual risk                                  perceptions, we will achieve a better                                           understanding of the risk perception formation                                  process.  The impact of an actual event in                                      changing perceptions and causing subsequent                                     behavioral changes will also be extensively                                     studied.  The role of the media and statements                                  from public officials will also be assessed.                                    Second, any short and/or long term effects on                                   the housing market will be identified and                                       quantified.  Again, the role of the media and                                   public officials will be assessed.  Third, the                                  welfare loss (in dollar terms) associated with                                  the event and with any misconception of risk                                    levels will be quantified.  Finally, the value                                  that individuals place on accurate geologic                                     information will be determined through                                          analysis of the housing market data.  In                                        essence, the value of knowing the relevant                                      geologic information, either through mapping                                    or hazard announcements will be obtained.",
