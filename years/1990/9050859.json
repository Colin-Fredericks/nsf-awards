 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern optics is the basis for some of the most innovative                      applications in today's technology.  Lasers and modern optics have              also had a major impact on the experimental work in the physical                sciences.  Yet this field has received very little attention in                 most college physics curricula.  While some physics departments                 have tried to reverse this trend in either their courses for the                majors or for the non-majors, few have attempted to incude this                 field in a connected and comprehensive manner in their                          undergraduate curriculum.  Union is introducing experimental modern             optics and lasers at several stages of the physics curriculum both              to educate a wider audience, and to provide a stronger background               for those who would pursue this field at a more advanced level.                 They are using high-quality optical components, lasers, detectors,              and analysers for advanced experiments, and also in laboratories                for non-science majors.  In addition, they are involving students               from other sciences and, especially, engineering in the work.  The              college is matching the award with an equal amont of funds.",
