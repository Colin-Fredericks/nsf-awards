 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new reconstitutable emulsion system was identified in                         laboratory, which is formed by addition of an aqueous vehicle                   to a finely divided solid.  The emulsion does not contain                       emulsifiers or other surfactant materials.  It is formed by                     dissolving saccharides or a hydrophilic polymer in a volatile                   solvent and the mixture is flash evaporated under vacuum until                  a dry solid is formed.  The addition of water to the dry solid                  forms a dispersed system having unique properties.  The new                     systems may be formed with strong acidic, alkaline or                           alcoholic solutions, is thixotropic, and the particle size                      decreases with time for about two weeks.  The objective of                      this research is to establish the thermodynamic properties of                   the new emulsion obtained in laboratory.  The research may                      lead to a new group of emulsion systems with application in                     pharmaceuticals, food and chemical industries.",
