 "awd_abstract_narration": "PIs proposed to develop construction control systems to better                  understand production operations, to develop methods of satisfying              conflicting objectives, and to design standards for integrated                  process and project control.  An interdisciplinary research team,               including academics (Maryland, Virginia Tech, Stanford and Penn                 State), NIST and construction industry, is assembled.                                                                                                           The team will work to develop and test on site, a computer based                open system for planning and control during the construction phase              of a project.  The overall goal of this research is to establish                an integrated and flexible control concept for construction which               is based on system and information theory, hierarchical control and             state-machine concepts, uncertainty analysis, and computer                      simulation and emulation.  In this context a generic framework will             be developed to provide a structure for controlling four specific               construction objectives:  Quality, Safety, Productivity and                     Precision (As-Built).  Data acquisition, reduction and analysis of              construction parameters are needed.  This process can be in the                 form of point-in-time sampling rather than real time.  A case study             will be considered to perform this process.  Automatic data                     collection devices, such as senors (e.g., strain gauges) and voice              recognition systems, will be selected and tested for the case                   study.//",
