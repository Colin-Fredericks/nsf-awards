 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade, there has been considerable development in                investigating methods of symbolic mathematics in many application               areas of computer science and artificial intelligence, for example,             engineering design - solid and geometric modeling, robotics and motion          planning, and machine vision.  Most of this research, however, has              been theoretical, and its application to real problems has been                 limited because of the slow progress made in applying the                       combinatorially expensive symbolic techniques to real problems.  Also           there are no mechanisms in computer algebra and other symbolic                  techniques to handle issues of data error and computational precision.          Typically such problems are addressed in practice by using numerical            methods to approximate the underlying mathematical models.                      This workshop will focus on approaches for systematic integration of            symbolic techniques with numerical techniques.  Symbolic methods can            provide insight into the structure and stability of problem solutions           while numerical methods are efficient for handling the thousands of             data elements which arise in practical applications.  The workshop              will bring together experts from numerical computation, symbolic                computation, and application areas using such methods.  Some possible           topics of discussion are: methods for solving nonlinear equations,              homotopy methods, nonlinear optimization, exploitation of geometric             invariants, differential theories.",
