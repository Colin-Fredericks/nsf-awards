 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of these studies is to ascertain                     mechanisms of organism dispersal and rates of gene flow between                 deep-sea hydrothermal vent fields associated with contiguious                   and non-contiguous oceanic ridge systems.  A second, but                        equally important objective of these studies will be to delimit                 the genetic boundaries and systematic relationships among the                   suite of molluscan species occupying these unusual abyssal                      environments.  As hydrothermal vents share significant numbers                  of confamilial, congeneric and perhaps conspecific molluscan                    taxa with certain cold-water sulfide/methane seeps, the later                   environments will also be investigated as additional sources of                 larval recruitment to the ridge hydrothermal systems.                                Drs. Lutz and Vjrienhoek will sample the molluscan fauna                   associated with a number of geographically-separated vent and                   seep sites  in the eastern Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico and                      along the mid-Atlantic Ridge.  They will use electrophoretic                    and molecular techniques to examine three discrete models                       (\"island\" \"linear stepping-stone\", and \"reservoir\") of                          population structure, colonization, and gene flow in deep-sea                   vent populations.  Morphological features associated with                       juvenile molluscan shells will be analyzed to infer modes of                    larval development of species sampled from the various vent and                 seep habitats.  Inferences drawn from such analyses should                      provide a basis for an approximate rank-ordering of vent/seep                   molluscan species according to dispersal capability.  This, in                  turn, when coupled with genetic studies, should permit us a                     test of the validity of several recent hypotheses concerning                    the evolutionary consequences of different life-history                         strategies associated with the spectrum of organisms                            encountered at deep-sea vents and seeps.",
