The purpose of the  conference is              to review current research and the wealth of industrial                         applications that are in progress throughout the world with                     accelerators.  The conference is composed of two symposia which run             in parallel, the Research Symposium, and the Industrial                         Applications of Accelerators.  Some of the sessions are of common               interest and will be open for both groups.  Areas where papers have             been accepted include:  Atomic physics and related phenomena, Trace             & Surface Analysis with Ion Beams, Electron Beam Processing,                    Nuclear Physics, CTR & Related Phenomena, Neutron Activation                    Analysis & Bulk Analysis with Accelerators, Radiological Safety                 Aspects of Accelerators, Ion Implantation with particular emphasis              on Semiconductors & Metallurgical Applications, Geosciences and                 Related Phenomena, Charged Particle Microprobes, Super SIMS, Carbon             Dating, Computer Tomography, Synchrotron Light Source experiments,              Insitu Beams, Radiation Interaction with Ion Beams, Accelerator and             component Design & Automation, Targetry, Detection & electronics,               Medical, Biological & Chemical Applications, Material Analysis with             Ion Beams, Channeling, Stopping Power & Radiation Effects.  The                 conference is a topical conference of the American Physical Society             and the abstracts will be published in the September 1990 issue of              the Bulletin.  Over 150 scientists from India, and 18 from Egypt                have expressed interest in attending.  A selection committee from               academia, industry and government will select those to receive                  support.                                                                                                                                                        Scope:  Past participation of foreign scientists in this series of              conferences has proved to be quite beneficial to all concerned.                 This is the only conference in the world that addresses itself to               research and industrial applications of accelerators.  Participants             get to hear \"state-of-the-art\" papers, and to discuss common                    problems with world experts.  Most participating countries have                 obtained accelerators from U.S. manufacturers, and the interaction              of user scientists with scientists in the accelerator manufacturing             industry is important.",
