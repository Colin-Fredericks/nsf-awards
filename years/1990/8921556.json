 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-component polymer systems exhibit a rich variety of useful                mechanical, electrical, and optical properties.  The nature of                  the interface and free surface boundary regions is a central                    problem to the understanding and predicting of their complex                    behavior.  This ROW research-initiation grant will deal with                    composition-vs-distance profiles in the model systems of                        partially miscible polymers; (a) polystyrene/polybromostyrene                   (b) polystyrene/deuterated polystyrene.  The measurements will be               performed by several complementary techniques; (a) secondary ion                mass spectroscopy, (b) forward recoil elastic scattering with                   simultaneous measurement of time-of-flight and energy                           measurements, (c) neutron and x-ray reflectivity and                            fluorescence.  The first two techniques have resolutions of 120A                and 240A, respectively, and the advantage that the measured                     energy spectra can be converted simply and unambiguously into                   concentration profiles.  The reflectivity techniques have                       resolutions of approx. 20A but obtain data in inverse space and                 the interpretation is difficult without preliminary information                 from other methods.                                                                                                                                             The experimental program will focus on investigation of the                     equilibrium and dynamical properties of interfaces and surfaces                 as functions of chain length, interaction parameter, segment                    deuteration, and blend composition.  Of special interest are                    surface wetting and pre-wetting phase transitions and their                     relationship to bulk critical phenomena as predicted by various                 theoretical models.",
