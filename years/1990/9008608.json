 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solar wind plasma within 20 Ro will be studied using a                 variety of radio propagation techniques.  This will permit                      estimation of the spatial spectrum of density fluctuations, the                 mean flow velocity, its random component and the orientation of                 the magnetic field. These measurements will be compared with                    optical data, such as white light coronograph, magnetograph, and                emission line observations. The basic objectives will be to learn               more about the mechanism of coronal heating and the flow of                     energy near the critical point, and to study the coronal origin                 of large scale structures such as fast streams.  Within 20 Ro                   earlier observations have shown a rapid increase in random                      velocity, excess power in density fluctuations on scales of 10 to               300 km,  and density fluctuations which become highly isotropic.                This study will measure the acceleration of the particles through               the sonic point using multiple antenna intensity scintillations.                The spatial anisotropy as a function of spatial scale will be                   measured by comparing angular scattering (measured at the VLA)                  with phase scintillation (measured with the VLBA). The intensity                scintillations will be analyzed to learn the origin of the random               velocity component. Finally, observations within 20 Ro can be                   compared with surface measurements more accurately than those                   further from the sun because the mapping distance is small and                  stream-stream interactions are much less important. A study will                be made to determine the difference in the flow field between                   regions of different magnetic geometry.",
