Using the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics, the                         investigators will estimate the parameters of a lifecycle model                 involving Euler equations. Incorporated in this model will be the               assumptions of a lifetime budget constraint as well as a                        liquidity constraint. One of the important developments in this                 research is the use of the method of simulated scores to                        estimate the model.                                                                                                                                             Households do appear to switch their consumption and labor supply               patterns over long periods. They are likely to be constrained                   early on in their lifetime, at the time of major purchases or                   unforseen events (such as unemployment, catastrophic illness,                   etc). The incorporation of the endogeneity and imperfect                        observability of liquidity constraints in the type of model that                is being estimated will make it easier to confirm the importance                of these constraints on household behavior. Because of the                      methods used, the techniques can be generalized to the                          constraints that firms face, as well.",
