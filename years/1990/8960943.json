This                        project addresses the influence of temperature on the                           effects produced by the electron beam, determination of                         the relative effectiveness of a dose delivered by pulsed                        delivery versus a constant beam, and innovations in design                      of the acceleration tube and exit window for reliable                           operation of electron beam devices.                                                                                                                             The proposal leading to this Phase I award was submitted                        in response to the Small Business Innovation Research                           Program Solicitation, NSF 89-30.  The project addresses                         engineering design considerations for devices to deliver                        electron beam radiation for potential application in                            reducing emissions of pollutants in domestic and                                industrial wastewaters and gaseous emissions produced by                        combustion of fossil fuels and solid wastes.",
