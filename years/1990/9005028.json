 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the problem of discovering,                         identifying and locating resources in a nationwide network.  The                research is based on two fundamental tenets.  The first is that                 users should be able to identify a resource with a set of                       attributes or properties that describe the resource.  For                       example, rather than having to know the name or address of a                    processor, the user should be able to state that he or she wants                a processor that has a particular architecture, runs a certain                  operating system, supports a given software package, and is                     reachable via a specific communication protocol.  It should be                  the naming system's responsibility to locate a resource that                    matches such a description.  The second tenet is that the naming                system for a nationwide network will be highly decentralized.                   The primary reason for this decentralization is not the problem                 of scale so much as the problem of autonomy.  Such a network is                 expected to consist of a collection of autonomous systems, each                 of which is responsible for managing and naming its own                         resources.  For example, the National Research and Education                    Network spans thousands of autonomous organizations.  The naming                system for such a network probably will be decentralized                        proportionally.The researchers are investigating methods for                    identifying resources with a set of attributes, and exploring                   techniques for searching a large, high decentralized name space.                This effort is based on their experience designing and using two                experimental naming systems:  Profile and Univers.",
