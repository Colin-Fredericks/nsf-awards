 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in civil                         engineering and computer science between Dr. Boyd Paulson,                      Stanford University and Drs. George Fleming and Ken McCallum,                   University of Strathclyde, Scotland.  The aim of the project is                 to better integrate robotics in the construction industry with                  current computer-aided design management information and                        production systems.                                                                                                                                             Since the early 1980's, researchers have sought to apply                        robotics in the construction industry.  However, no unifying                    theory and few guidelines exist for defining and communicating                  knowledge about designs and field operations in a way that can                  be effectively utilized by such machines.  Thus far, most of the                \"robots\" in actual field applications have either been tele-                    operated machines remotely controlled by humans, or have been so                narrowly focused and highly specialized that automation could be                implemented only via procedural programs designed to anticipate                 all of the robots' limited requirements. In this joint  project,                the investigators will aim to design, assemble and develop a                    theoretical framework and experimental software for a general                   core of \"intelligence\" common to diverse types of autonomous                    machines. The research will consist of several interrelated                     projects to simulate the cognitive behavior of robot agents and                 to build a knowledge environment simulator in which to test                     prototype agent software as it evolves. The project will benefit                from the complementary expertise of the US and British investi-                 gators in computer-aided design. The results of this research                   will provide computer-based concepts to help integrate construc-                tion field processes into the other phases of the project life-                 cycle, such as planning, design and operations. 8922441                         GOULD                                                                           This award will support collaborative research in biophysics                    between Dr. Robert Gould, Middlebury College and Dr. W. Terence                 Coakley, University of Wales, Cardiff. The objective of the                     project is to exploit the use of ultrasound to segregate and                    isolate large particles of biological interest.                                                                                                                 When an ultrasonic standing wave field exists in a liquid-filled                chamber, suspended particles of a given type will tend to                       collect at positions in the chamber about a half wavelength                     apart.  The ultrasonic phenomena of radiation pressure and                      acoustic streaming associated with a standing wave field produce                forces and torques on objects in suspension.  Strengths of the                  forces and torques on a given particle depend mainly on the size                and shape of the particle and on the acoustical properties of                   compressibility and density of the particle, relative to the                    corresponding properties of the suspending liquid.  Thus                        particles differing in acoustic properties will tend to collect                 in different positions in the chamber.   Methods for collecting                 particles in suspension with which most biologists are familiar,                such as centrifugation, dielectrophoresis and application of                    magnetic fields, tend to cause particles to migrate to one or                   two sites.  Ultrasound offers a unique capability to concentrate                particles at many discrete locations in the suspending phase.                   This project aims to utilize the differences in the forces and                  torques on different types of particles to diverge them, one                    type from another, so they may be harvested and studied                         separately. The results of this research will provide important                 information regarding the applicability of ultrasound to a                      variety of biological systems.  The project will benefit from                   the complementary expertise of the two investigators, as well as                their past history of fruitful collaboration.",
