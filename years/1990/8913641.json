 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deals with program synthesis, the derivation of a program           to meet a given specification.  While the specification describes the           conditions the desired program is to satisfy, the program itself                describes a detailed method for meeting those conditions.  The benefit          of this research is to make the programming process easier and less             subject to error.  The method is based on a deductive approach, in              which the problem of deriving a program is regarded as one of proving           a mathematical theorem.  The theorem expresses the existence of an              object meeting the specified conditions.  The proof is restricted to            be sufficiently constructive to indicate a method for finding the               desired output.  That method becomes the basis for a program, which is          extracted from the proof.                                                       The emphasis of the work has been on automating as much as possible of          the program derivation process.  In particular, theorem-proving                 methods particularly well-suited to the program synthesis application           have been developed.  An experimental interactive program-derivation            system is being implemented.  Current research topics included                  developing a more automatic theorem prover, modifying already                   constructed programs, and controlling the efficiency of derived                 programs.",
