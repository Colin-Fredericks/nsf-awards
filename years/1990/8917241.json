 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Donald K. Grayson, Ms. Lee Ann                     Kreutzer will conduct a structural analysis of bison bone and                   apply the results to faunal material recovered from the Mill Iron               archaeological site located near Ekalaka in southeastern Montana.               Using a recently developed technique, Quantitative Digital                      Radiography, Ms. Kreutzer will study a series of bison skeletons                housed at the University of Wyoming and measure bone density of                 different skeletal elements collected at multiple sites.  This                  will provide a basis to determine relative resistance of                        different bones to destruction in archaeological and geological                 settings.  She will then analyze bison remains recovered from the               Mill Iron site which dates to approximately 11,000 years ago and                has yielded both abundant faunal remains and stone tools.  Ms.                  Kreutzer hopes to determine the extent to which the skeletal                    composition of the assemblage is determined by either cultural                  practice or differential preservation.                                                                                                                          Because skeletal remains from hunted animals constitutes a major                class of archaeological data archaeologists have focussed a great               deal of attention on the analysis of such materials.  In most                   sites the distribution of skeletal parts is non-random:  ie. not                what one would expect given the numbers of different kinds of                   bones in a mammalian skeleton.  Archaeologists have generally                   claimed that such departures from an expected distribution                      reflect cultural practice and have tried to interpret assemblages               in this light.  More recently it has been pointed out that                      differential preservation may play a major patterning role and                  that some bones are more frequently encountered because they are                better able to withstand destructive forces.  Ms. Kreutzer's                    research will address this issue.                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  It should result               in information and analytic techniques of use to archaeologists                 who study large mammals from many time periods and parts of the                 world.  It will also contribute to our understanding of North                   American prehistory and further the training of a promising young               archaeologist.",
