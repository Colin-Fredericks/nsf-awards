 "awd_abstract_narration": "Skeletal muscle is not only important in animal locomotion, but                 also constitutes a major metabolic store of protein that can be                 quickly mobilized when dietary intake is insufficient to meet an                animal's nutritional needs.  During starvation-induced atrophy,                 muscle protein is degraded to amino acids, which are then used by               other tissues for the synthesis of proteins essential for life.                 In addition, muscle atrophy can be induced by disuse, nerve                     injury, and disease.  In some diseases, such as muscular                        dystrophy, wasting is so severe that the individual dies.                                                                                                       The intracellular regulation of protein breakdown in any animal                 is poorly understood.  The crustacean claw muscle provides a                    favorable model system for elucidating proteolytic mechanisms.                  During each intermolt cycle, the claw muscle undergoes a                        sequential atrophy and restoration, in which protein content                    decreases 40% during the premolt period and is resynthesized                    following molt.  Atrophy apparently facilitates withdrawal of the               pair of large claws at the time the shell is shed.  Protein                     degradation appears to be mediated by five enzymes: four calcium-               dependent proteinases (CDPs) and a multicatalytic proteinase                    (MCP).  These enzymes are active at neutral pH and degrade the                  contractile proteins of muscle.                                                                                                                                 This proposal examines the regulation of intracellular                          proteolysis in a muscle that resembles, both morphologically and                biochemically, vertebrate skeletal muscle.  Since atrophy                       coincides with elevated levels of a steroid molting hormone,                    experiments will investigate the hormonal control of protein                    turnover (synthesis and degradation) in claw muscles in culture.                Other experiments will identify the major steps in the signal                   pathway controlling proteolysis.  The CDPs and endogenous                       regulatory factors will be purified for further characterization                and production of antibodies.  Molt-induced changes in the                      expression, content, and intracellular distribution of the MCP                  will be quantified.  In addition to defining the function of                    these enzymes in protein breakdown, these studies will yield new                and fundamental information on the regulation of proteolytic                    processes common to all animal cells.",
