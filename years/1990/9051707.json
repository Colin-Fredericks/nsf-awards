 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colgate University is teaching a \"hands-on\" laboratory in the                   course in geophysics which focuses on the shallow subsurface                    environment.  Such investigations are becoming more crucial as                  groundwater shortages and groundwater pollution become more common.             The course is a modification of the senior-level geophysics course              which is being changed so that the lab focuses on those techniques              which are most applicable to the shallow subsurface:  gravity,                  seismology, and earth resistivity.  The labs are structured in 3                modules, each dealing with with one of the techniques.  The first               week of each segment is devoted to measurement techniques and data              reduction.  The following 2 weeks are devoted to data collection                within a segment of the Chenango River Valley, a glacially buried               valley  containing approximately 500 feet of sand and gravel.  The              final week of each segment is devoted to modelling the subsurface               using two-dimensional techniques and personal computers.  Each                  year, the course will investigate a segment of the valley using all             three techniques.  Over the years, a larger picture of the valley               will be acquired as one group of students merges their results with             those of years past.  Students are also encouraged to utilize the               equipment in senior research projects.                                                                                                                          The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
