Dr. Thunnel is awarded funds to continue his research with Dr.                  Corliss (Duke University) in the investigation of the                           Quaternary paleoceanography of the Sulu and South China Seas.                   Sediment deposition in these two basins is controlled by                        intervening sills that greatly inhibit the exhange of bottom                    water. During a cruise in 1988 Drs. Thunell and Corliss                         collected transects of cores along these sills to document                      changing paleoceanographic conditions during                                    glacial/interglacial cycles of the late Pleistocene. With their                 present award they will complete their core analyses and extend                 them to include studies of living benthic foraminifera                          collected in their box cores.  The ecologic and isotopic                        information derived in this manner will be used to reconstruct                  the history of changes of the late Quaternary paleoenvironments                 of the region.  Their data will also be used to reconstruct the                 late Quaternary history of monsoonal circulation of the western                 equatorial Pacific; they intend to compare this history with                    results derived from other studies of the NW Indian Ocean.",
