 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Section of Ecology and Systematics             at Cornell University to purchase equipment for two introductory                courses which were introduced to infuse the excitement and                      experimental approach of modern organismal biology into the                     curriculum.  The courses will enroll 100 to 120 students per year,              and approximately one-third of the Biological Sciences majors at                Cornell and half of the Natural Resources majors will take one or               both of the courses.  Laboratories will be hands-on exercises for               the students.  Functional Ecology (BioSci 272) integrates                       information about the ecology, physiology, and behavior of                      vertebrates in a phylogenetic context.  Weekly laboratories                     alternate surveys of the vertebrates with experiments that                      illustrate characteristic physiological features of those taxa.                 The twice-weekly laboratories in Functional and Comparative                     Morphology (BioSci 274) combine dissection of preserved material                with electromyography, motion analysis, and morphometries in an                 hypothesis-testing approach to morphology.  Funds will be used to               purchase laboratory instruments (for osmometry, telemetry, oxygen               analysis, and electromyography), video equipment (for motion                    analysis and morphometry), a treadmill and air-flow visualizer (for             studies of locomotion), and microcomputers (for data collection and             analysis).  The equipment will be shared by the new courses and                 used in an advanced organismal biology courses and for                          undergraduate projects.  The grantee is matching this award with                non-Federal sources.",
