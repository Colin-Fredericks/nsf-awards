 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports travel by 10 U.S.                           scientists to India to attend the 17th IUPAC International                      Symposium on the Chemistry of Natural Products to be held in                    India February 4-8, 1990.  The topics to be covered include                     natural products and human health, agriculture, and                             cosmetics; bioorganic chemistry and general natural products                    chemistry.  It will address the isolation, structure,                           elucidation of the products as well as reactions, synthesis                     and biosynthesis.  Most of the participants plan also to                        attend a U.S.-Pakistan workshop in Karachi on the same topic                    where specific progress made in that field would be                             discussed, with special reference to the natural products of                    Pakistan.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  The IUPAC Conference is likely to be attended by                        large numbers from India, the industrial countries and                          several South Asian countries and should provide for                            extensive exchange of information.  Participation by U.S.                       scientists fits the guidelines of the U.S.-India Program.                       At no additional costs U.S. participants would contribute to                    a successful workshop in Pakistan where significant impact                      can be made to that field and where an excellent institute                      exists for the chemisty of natural products.",
