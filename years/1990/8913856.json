 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in advanced ceramic              materials between Dr. John Mackenzie, University of California at               Los Angeles, and Professor J. Livage, University of Pierre and                  Marie Curie, Paris, France.                                                                                                                                     Advanced ceramic materials such as high temperature superconductors             and the insulating tiles on the space shuttle are the key to                    future technological advances which can improve the quality of                  life and make the US more competitive in the international                      marketplace.  In this project, Drs. MacKenzie and Livage will                   combine their expertise in sol-gel science, specifically the                    expertise of the French team on the physical chemistry and                      structures of complex liquids which form gels, and the background               of the US group in the transformation of gels into ceramics.  An                exchange of postdoctoral students is proposed, as well as a joint               workshop on sol-gel derived materials.  Topics to be investigated               include sol-gel systems leading to materials such as the supercon-              ducting ceramics and electronic ceramics like barium titanate.                  Dr. MacKenzie and his team are currently studying the preparation               of superconducting ceramics; Dr. Livage is actively investigating               the physical chemistry and structures of complex liquid solutions               used in the preparation of these materials.  The results of this                research may provide valuable information for the development of                new engineering materials.",
