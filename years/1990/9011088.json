 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a collaborative project                     by Drs. Arun Shukla of the Mechanical Engineering                               Department, University of Rhode Island (URI), and B.D.                          Agarwal, of the Mechanical Engineering Department, Indian                       Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT-K).  The project aims                      at the study of damage initiation and growth, under dynamic                     loading conditions, in transparent birefringent composites                      made of glass fibers and polyester resin.  An optical                           recording system of the Cranz Schardin type is to be                            designed and constructed at IIT-K.  It will be capable of                       recording 20 pictures at rates from 20,000 to 900,000                           frames per second.  Specimens are to be photographed during                     the fracture process at very short time intervals.  Initial                     fringe patterns are expected to give information on the the                     damage initiation conditions while subsequent fringe                            patterns will give information about the dynamic damage                         growth and damage arrest conditions.                                                                                                                            Scope:  The topic of this research on fracture of                               composites under dynamic loads is timely since it is not                        currently well understood.  The Indian and U.S.                                 collaborators have expertise in dealing with the subject                        research.  Their experiences complement each other well.                        This project represents a case of a potentially very useful                     international collaboration.",
