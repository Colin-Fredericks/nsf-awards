 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is that a small workshop be held with approximately 40             participants from universities, colleges, and industry who are                  interested in optoelectronics education.  The purpose will be to                discuss the goals, curricula, and courses in optoelectronics programs.          The objectives are to produce suggestions concerning the contents of            undergraduate and graduate curricula, and suggestions as to what the            general engineering or physics students would need.  There are several          related questions.  What should be included in an optoelectronics               option within electrical engineering or physics, what should be in an           undergraduate degree program in optoelectronics, what should all                electrical engineering and physics students know about                          optoelectronics, and what are the essentials in a graduate program in           optoelectronics?  Perhaps the most important question is, what optics-          related material should be introduced into the existing undergraduate           courses?  For example, photodetectors should go into the existing               solid state or electronics courses.  Other questions to be addressed            are:  how much lens design, physical optics, quantum effects, sources,          detectors, receivers, fibers, atmospheric properties, and optical               system design should be included in the curricula?  Recommendations             concerning these questions will not have an impact unless we also have          means of implementing the suggestions.  One of the main goals of the            workshop will be to devise means of implementation, such as providing           modules, ideas of demonstrations, video presentations that could be             used in other courses, and solved homework problems to encourage                instructors to assign optoelectronics problems in appropriate courses.                                                                                                                                                                          The logical next step would be to organize a symposium on                       optoelectronics education that would have much broader attendance with          the goal of disseminating and discussing the proposals that result              from our workshop.  One of the tasks of the workshop will be to                 assemble an organizing committee for that symposium.",
