Successful data management requires field stations to take                advantage of advances in technology, and to support staff at                    field stations.                                                                                                                                                 This project will support a workshop to be held April 22-26,                    1990, at the Kellogg Biological Station, as a sucessor to a                     similar workshop held in 1982.  The purpose will be to assess the               progress that has been made since the earlier workshop, to share                and disseminate information, to recommend standards and protocols               to aid collaborative research and to propose new directions for                 which pilot programs might lead the way.                                                                                                                        The workshop will be co-sponsored by the Organization of                        Biological Field Stations (OBFS) and the Southern Association of                Marine Labs (SAML), and will represent the diversity of sites and               the various stages of development of data management systems in                 these two groups.  Approximately 40 representatives from field                  station and marine laboratories will be invited to participate in               one of three working groups:  1) Data Administration,  2)Database               Standards to Facilitate Collaborative Research, and  3)Computers                and Software for Data Management.  A report of the workshops                    conclusions and recommendation will be made to the National                     Science Foundation, and distributed to the institutions                         constitution OBFS and SAML, as well as to other interested                      scientists.",
