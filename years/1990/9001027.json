 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will study several topics in set theory,                  primarily concerning the core model and its applications.  The                  major aim is to generalize the core model, first to include                     everything up to Woodin cardinals, and then to include Woodin                   cardinals as well.  Preliminary results have revealed the                       probable structure of this core model, and the main remaining                   problem is to find a condition on the extenders in the core model               which will ensure that iterated ultrapowers of the core model are               well-founded.                                                                        Other problems include questions related to the singular                   cardinal hypothesis, to infinitary Ramsey theory, and to the                    existence of definable cofinal sequences witnessing the                         singularity of an infinite singular cardinal.                                        Set theory is usually considered the foundation of all                     mathematics, so studies of this kind are in a sense exploring                   the limits of mathematical possibility.  What axioms about sets                 can be trusted as a sound foundation?  What economies of proof                  can be achieved by using stronger set theoretic assumptions?                    Questions such as these are the motivating forces of this and                   other projects in set theory.",
