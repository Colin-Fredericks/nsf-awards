Recent research has                revealed that a major lignin degradative pathway is controlled by               oxidative reactions involving Mn.  Prior research has revealed                  marked differences in the initial Mn concentrations in conifer                  wood, and these differences correspond to species susceptible to                brown-rot (little lignin degraded) versus those susceptible to                  white-rot (lignin and cellulose breakdown).  Since lignin                       comprises approximately one-third of the original conifer wood,                 the type of decomposition pathway followed controls the amount of               long-term carbon storage.  Therefore, this research will have                   direct implications for understanding the role of coarse woody                  debris (CWD) in global carbon storage.                                               Harmon, Jarrell and Caldwell hypothesize that: 1) early                    changes in carbon and nitrogen dynamics are controlled by                       decomposer colonization patterns, 2) long-term carbon dynamics                  are controlled by the availability of the microelement Mn which                 determines, in part, whether lignin is decomposed, and 3)                       nitrogen dynamics are controlled by the abundance of available                  carbon and not total carbon.  To test these hypotheses the                      investigators will conduct a three year study of carbon and                     nitrogen dynamics that examines changes in wood cell wall                       chemistry, manganese availability, microbial physiology and                     biochemistry, nitrogen dynamics and mass losses in decomposing                  logs from different coniferous ecosystems.  They will also                      continue development of a decomposition model that predicts long-               term carbon and nitrogen dynamics for many species and sizes of                 logs.                                                                                Harmon, Jarrell and Caldwell are innovative and productive                 investigators of the role of woody debris in forested ecosystems.
