 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists are constantly in search of more robust statistical                  techniques so that departures from standard assumptions will not                disrupt the estimation process. Regression quantile methods  and                \"breakdown\" and \"tail-behavior\" measures, the foci of this                      research project,  hold a great deal of promise for developing                  more robust alternatives.                                                                                                                                       The specific objectives of the project with respect to regression               quantiles are to refine the current methods and to develop user                 friendly algorithms and programs for applying these methods in                  linear models and related areas, further extending the theory                   to include dependent and non-stationary cases, to study dual                    regression quantiles and their corresponding rank statistics and                to develop large dimension asymptotics where there are a large                  number of parameters.  A second line of research involves global                measures of robustness and their relation to outlier diagnostics.                                                                                               Analyses will be completed to understand more completely what                   causes statistical procedures to break down in the presence of                  outliers, particularly through the exploration of the close                     connection between finite-sample \"breakdown\" and \"tail behavior\"                of estimators, and to refine current procedures for detecting and               adjusting for outliers and to develop inference methods that are                highly resistant to the presence of outliers and influential                    observations.                                                                                                                                                   The development and distribution of the algorithms created by                   this project will hasten the use of these important                             methodological developments by applied researchers in economics.                Extending the theoretical work will eventually result in better                 empirical work, as the departures from underlying assumptions                   like normality and independence will no longer necessarily lead                 to a breakdown in esimtation techniques.",
