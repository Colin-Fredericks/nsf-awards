 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves measurement of the concentrations of                 uranium series nuclides (238U, 234U, 230Th, 232Th) in fossil                    corals using the high-precision, high-sensitivity techniques                    recently developed by the principal investigator and colleagues.                The new mass spectrometric technique allows one to obtain 230Th                 ages of corals that are significantly more precise than was                     previously possible.  Based on analytical error, corals as young                as 3 years old have ages distinguishable from zero, and corals as               old as 600,000 years old have ages distinguishable from infinity.               The ages are generally more precise than 14C ages all the way                   through the 14 C range.  We now have the potential to obtain                    detailed records of events that are preserved in coral                          stratigraphy and in the composition of coral skeletons.  This                   proposal aims to take advantage of both of these potentials.  I                 wish to extract detailed records of (1) the timing of late                      Quaternary (last 150,000 y) sea level variations and (2) changes                in the 14C/12C ratio in the atmosphere between 8,000 and 12,000                 years ago, and about 28,000 years ago.  The records will be                     extracted from corals collected from the Huon Peninsula, Papua,                 New Guinea.  This region has a high tectonic uplift rate;                       therefore much of the coral record from the last 150,000 years or               so is subaerially exposed and accessible.  Such records would                   shed light on the causes of late Quaternary climate change and                  changes in the 14C/12C ratio in the atmosphere.                                      Funds from the National Science Foundation and the                         University of Minnesota have already been obtained for collecting               samples, determining the 14C concentrations in the corals, and                  renovating the Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory at the                U. of Minnesota, where the high precision uranium series                        measurements will be made.  This proposal requests funds for the                last stage of the project:  analysis of the samples in the                      Minnesota Laboratory and publication of the results.",
