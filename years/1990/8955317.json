 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New York Zoological Society/Bronx Zoo is requesting funds to bring          together in a conference zoo educators, university scholars, field              biologists, ecologists, and U.S. science school teachers from middle and        secondary schools who have participated in Bronz Zoo training programs          or who have built a relationship with a local zoo somewhere in the U.S.         The conference, international in scope, is to be held in Caracas,               Venezuela 23-27 January, 1990 and will explore global perspectives on           environmental issues and will catalyze ideas to enrich wildlife and             environmental education programs in the Western Hemisphere.  The five           day conference will include workshops, papers, discussions, and field           trips to environmental locations and Venezuelan classrooms.                                                                                                     The twelve U.S. science school teachers will follow up their                    interactions and experiences at the conference and in the field with            projects which will bring the issues into their classrooms and which            will enhance their knowledge of the subject matter and how to present it        to their students and colleagues.
