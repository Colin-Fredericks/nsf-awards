 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid hormones are useful tools for studying the control of gene              expression in eukaryotic organisms.  Ecdysone is the steroid                    molting hormone in insects which helps to regulate the                          developmental changes that occur during the insect's life cycle.                A gene from Drosophila, E74 which responds to ecdysone in a primary             manner and which is believed to regulate the expression of other                genes has been isolated.  How this gene is regulated by ecdysone                and how the product of this gene, in turn, regulates other genes                are the goals of this research project.  Sequences from putative                regulatory regions of this gene isolated from several Drosophila                species will be compared and conserved regions identified.                                                                                                      Understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this                 gene by ecdysone and, in turn, the mechanism(s) where by the                    product of this gene regulates other genes are admirable goals.                 While it is unlikely that a full understanding of these mechanisms              will result from this project to be carried out at an undergraduate             institution, many undergraduates will be introduced to a high level             of basic research and some factual information relevant to the                  stated goals should be obtained.***//",
