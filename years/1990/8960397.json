 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heterogeneous, multi-vendor local networks are the norm in the                population of universities, colleges and business joining the                   NSFNET and other national research networks.  Little attention                  has been paid to resource accounting on these local networks.                   While this problem is reasonably well-defined (and solved) in                   telephony and batch-computing, in the case of local networks                    there are more complex technical and economic issues.                             This project aims to develop a practical solution for local                   network resource accounting.  The principal investigator is                     investigating a distributed, programmable traffic/resource                      accounting monitor for the IEEE 802 family of local networks.                   It differs from current work in that: 1) it decodes packets at                  a higher level in the ISO model (level-4 and above); 2) the                     design is geared to multi-protocol networks; 3) the architecture                is extensible to high-speed, fiber-based networks; and 4) the                   system accommodates differing administrative/accounting goals of                diverse organizations.  The research objectives are concerned                   with the detailed modelling of tasks and subsequent design of a                 low-cost platform for network accounting.***",
