 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for the purchase and construction of two                    greenhouses with an attached headhouse and an indoor                            environmentally controlled growth facility consisting of three                  growth rooms and 12 growth chambers.  The greenhouses are                       designed to be easily modified to conform to potential future                   regulations for the propagation of transgenic plants.  Three                    rooms within one of the houses will be equipped with refrigerated               cooling to provide temperature reduction during summer months.                  The growth rooms and growth chambers will be located within the                 University's new BioScience Complex.  They will provide                         relatively large amounts of environmentally controlled space for                routine plant growth.  The chambers will provide greater and more               precise ranges of temperature (100  to 400 C) and light (0 to 1200              micro mol/photons m-2 s-1 at growth height) for more rigorously                 defined growth requirements.  Major projects utilizing the                      proposed new facilities include:  hybridization in natural plant                populations (Arnold); regulation of gene active in later                        embryogensis (Galau); breedng structure and gene flow in plant                  populations (Hamrick); genetic and environmental control of                     flower development (Malmberg); differential expression of two                   multigene families (Meagher); environmental effects on heat shock               and auxin regulation (Nagao); phytochrome structure and                         functional relationships in transgenic plants (Pratt);                          photosynthetic acclimation in C3 plants (Sage); transposable                    elements in maize and rice (Wessler); and moss phylogeny and                    paternity in milkweeds (Wyatt).",
