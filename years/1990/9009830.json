 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research initiation award provides support to study the               dynamic control strategy for direct drive actuators used in                     precision machining systems.  To realize the full potential of                  direct actuation, advanced dynamic control techniques will be                   investigated to address problems of dynamic interaction between                 drives and machining processes and dynamic coupling between axes.               Current linear motor technology may provide the response, speed and             force required for machining and could have great potential to                  realize higher speed and higher precision machining systems at a                cost advantage.  Since few applications of linear motors for                    machining exist, advanced control theory has seldom been applied                to this problem. This research investigates the control methods and             techniques for linear motors from the perspective of the entire                 machining systems, as opposed to exclusively considering the                    actuator, independent of the machining process.",
