 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are apparent differences in the style of deformation                 between various foreland fold and thrust belts.  Despite these                  differences, the overall topology of foreland belts is remark-                  ably similar in that both thrust belts and fold belts show, (1) a               cratonward decreasing systematic spacing of major structures,                   (2) a shared regional decollement and (3) multiple lesser                       internal decollements levels.  The fundamental differences in                   style (folding vs. faulting) can be related to the strength,                    stacking order and rheology of the stratigraphy.  By applying an                analysis of the flow instability of a layered sequence for a non-               linear viscous fluid, the initiation and localization of first                  order structures in both fold-dominated and fault-dominated fold/               thrust belts will be determined.  This theory will predict the                  spacing of major structures, whether folds or thrusts, within a                 layered sequence for a range of geologically plausible represen-                tations of the stratigraphic sequences of the Plateau Province of               Pennsylvania and the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt.  Further                   analysis of the finite evolution of these structures for a non-                 linear rheology will focus on the transition from folding to                    faulting that may be responsible for the observed deformation in                the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt.  Thus, this study will                      attempt to unify the mechanisms for the origin of foreland fold                 and thrust belts.",
