 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with an approximation theory for                variational (optimization) problems and its application.  A major               effort of the research will go to the development of a                          quantitative theory that would be more directly applicable in a                 numerical environment and would provide a means for calculating                 error estimates.  Of particular interest is the application of                  the theory to a stochastic environment, including the computer                  implementation of solution procedures.  Three application areas                 have been singled out for detailed study in this project:                       stochastic optimization problems, estimation theory in                          statistics, and random operator equations that model conductivity               or flow through random composite materials.                                          The research is in the general area of applied mathematics                 with applications to the theory of statistics.",
