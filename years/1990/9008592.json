 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional manifolds appeal to us at a very basic                   level, but they are very difficult to understand.  There are many               ways to construct examples of 3-manifolds, but the simplest sorts               of questions about the constructed manifolds often cannot be                    answered.  For example, it is very difficult to tell whether two                construction schemes yield the same or different manifolds.                          What is needed is a computable collection of invariants                    which distill the vast amount of information contained in the                   three-manifold into a usable form.  The standard invariants -                   Euler characteristic, homology, fundamental group - either                      contain almost no information, or are very difficult to work                    with.                                                                                Hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the most important - and most                   complicated - class of geometric 3-manifolds.  Hyperbolic                       manifolds have the same metric properties as the non-Euclidean                  geometry discovered by Bolyai, Gauss, and Lobachevsky in the                    1820's.  The metric can be used to carry out measurements.  In                  particular, such invariants as the volume (the size of the                      manifold) and the length spectrum (the set of all lengths of non-               trivial closed geodesics in the manifold) can be used to study                  these 3-manifolds.  Subtler geometric invariants can be defined                 as well.                                                                             Recent research indicates that these invariants may be very                useful in helping us to understand 3-manifolds.  This project                   involves extensive machine computation in an approach to                        understanding these invariants.",
