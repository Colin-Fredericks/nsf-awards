Typical applications include the                    exchange of two-dimensional images among members of an                          undergraduate astronomy consortium; interactive login by upper-                 level computer science students on a parallel processing machine;               and improved access to databases such as MEDLINE, Chemical                      Abstracts and the MLA International Bibliography.  Further,                     Middlebury's specialized library collections, such as that at the               Institute for Northern Studies, is now available to off-campus                  scholars.  The connection aids Middlebury's recruiting of the high-             caliber faculty they need to maintain and improve their academic                programs.  The link is a critical resource for research and                     instruction.",
