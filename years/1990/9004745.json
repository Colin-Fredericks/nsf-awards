 "awd_abstract_narration": "Early to Late Silurian limestones from the Heceta Formation                record the earliest occurrence of widespread carbonate deposition               in the region and represent the earliest foundation for shallow                 water platform development within the arc.  The excellent                       preservation of shallow to deep subtidal deposits within the                    Alexander arc contrasts with the poor preservation of many marine               sediments that originated within other island arcs.  Hence, these               limestones provide important insights into the styles, processes                and bathymetry of carbonate deposition in tectonically active                   areas.  Although previously described as having a shallow marine                origin, the limestones from the Heceta Formation can be                         differentiated into shallow water platform, platform margin, and                slope facies.  Renewal support will enable PI to pursue topics                  that relate to: (1) the dynamics of reef sedimentation and                      carbonate platform development within the Alexander arc; (2)                    physical and biologic controls on stromatolite distribution                     within the arc; and (3) regional biogeographic correlations.  The               proposed research will involve field work and laboratory analyses               during a two-year period and will generate a model for carbonate                platform and reef evolution within a tectonic framework.  Results               of the proposed research will refine our understanding of                       Silurian reef evolution and decline in different tectonic                       settings, factors affecting Phanerozoic stromatolite development,               and the paleogeography of the Alexander terrane.",
