 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quasi-permanent sea ice cover of the Arctic Ocean is a central              component of the northern high latitude climate system, and secular             changes in the concentration and thickness of the sea ice can be                important proxy indicators of wide-spread arctic climate                        variations.  While interannual differences in ice concentration and             extent are relatively easily documented from microwave satellite                imagery, variations in thickness require the analysis of direct in-             situ observations.  This project is an effort to analyze selected               sea ice draft profiles obtained with an upward looking sonar by                 U.S. submarines while crossing the Arctic Ocean.  These data have               been obtained routinely since 1975, but have not yet been subjected             to a rigorous examination, nor have they been related to other in               situ and remotely sensed environmental data.  The proposed                      statistical techniques are expected to be sufficiently precise to               reveal interannual variations in the arctic ice thickness on the                decadal time scale, which may be an early indicator of hemispheric              climate change.",
