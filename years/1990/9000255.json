 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New England region has a high concentration of research,                  educational, and entrepreneurial organizations.  This                           concentration has created a heavy demand for network                            communication services to facilitate the exchange of information                and ideas, both within the region and with colleagues in other                  parts of the nation and even internationally.                                                                                                                   Recognizing this need, Boston University, Harvard University, and               the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have spearheaded the                  formation of a regional network to improve communication                        services.  The network, the New England Academic and Research                   Network (NEARNET), has 21 member organizations and is growing                   rapidly.  Its current connection to the NSFNET backbone is shared               with other JVNCNET users in the Northeast and increases the                     hopcount between NEARNET's most remote members and the backbone                 point of presence by as much as a factor of two.                                                                                                                An additional backbone node located at MIT would provide more                   reliable, faster service to New England users of NSF facilities,                such as supercomputers, and would make the unique resources that                this region has to offer more accessible to the NSFNET community.                                                                                               This significantly improved access will be a catalyst for the                   development of the \"information infrastructure\" in New                          England.***",
