 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northern Kentucky University will initiate a 4-week commuter                    Young Scholars project for 40 students in grades 8-9 in physics                 and math.  The goal of the Northern Kentucky University Young                   Scholars Program-Early Alert Initiative is to increase the                      awareness and interest of junior high students in mathematics and               physics as potential career options.  The program is designed to                present mathematics, physics and other applied sciences and the                 tools for solving exciting problems, individually, and in small                 cooperative learning groups.  This four-week commuter summer                    program enjoys community and industrial support as students take                weekly tours of research and development centers, and engineers                 and scientists come to campus to work with students.  Follow-up                 activities include a bi-monthly newsletter and six Saturday                     workshops to further develop problem-solving skills.",
