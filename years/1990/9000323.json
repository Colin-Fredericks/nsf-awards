 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the preceeding grant periods, the instrumentation                        required to perform in situ benthic flux chamber measurements                   and to retrieve and maintain sediment cores at in situ                          temperatures and pressures during shipboard pore water sampling                 and incubations were developed.  This project will utilize                      these instruments to study two important aspects of the marine                  carbon cycle, the mineralization of organic matter and the                      kinetics of CaCO3 dissolution in deep sea surface sediments.                    Specifically, sites adjacent to the highly productive west                      African margin (in collaboration with the French-sponsored                      EUMELI program) and sites above and below the lysocline in the                  western equatorial Pacific will be studied.  At each location,                  the particulate input of organic matter, opal, and CaCO3, the                   mineralization and dissolution rate of these phases in surface                  sediments, and the burial rate will be determined.  This                        information, when coupled through models to environmental                       parameters such as bottom water CaCO3 saturation state,                         diffusive boundary layer thickness, etc., will permit the                       following questions to be addressed:  1. Are organic matter                     fluxes to the seafloor off Africa important to deep Atlantic                    carbon budgets?  2. Can organic matter fluxes off Africa be                     supported by vertical rain rates as measured by sediment traps?                 3. Is denitrification at the deep seafloor important off west                   Africa?  4. What is the CaCO3 dissolution rate constant at the                  seafloor?  5. To what extent is metabolic CO2 neutralized by                    the dissolution of sedimentary CaCO3?  6. Does transport across                 the diffusive sublayer limit the total CaCO3 dissolution rate                   in the deep sea?",
