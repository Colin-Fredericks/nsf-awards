 "awd_abstract_narration": "Peptide sequence analysis of two newly identified members of the murine         \"High Mobility Group\" of nonhistone chromatin proteins, HMG-I and HMG-Y,        revealed that these proteins are identical (except for an internal              deletion of 11 residues in the HMG-Y protein) and each contains two             exact copies of a conserved palindromic amino acid sequence motif whose         structure is similar to the DNA-binding, antitumor and antiviral,               peptide drugs distamycin and netropsin.  Pure HMG-I or HMG-Y proteins           specifically bind, in vitro, to stretches of A/T-rich DNA found in the          flanking regulatory regions of many areas of mammalian chromosomes              including G/O bands, centromeres and telomeres in vivo.  Nucleotide             sequence analyses of the cDNA clones coding for these isoform protiens          indicate that they are derived from a common mRNA precursor by                  alternative splicing.  Therefore, the following specific research aims          are proposed:  (i) Determine which regions of these isoform proteins are        responsible for specific DNA binding and determine whether there are            differences between HMG-I and HMG-Y in their association with A/T rich          sequences of DNA; (ii) Utilizing synchronized cells, investigate HMG-I          and HMG-Y protein synthesis and mRNA synthesis and splicing during              different phases of the cell cycle; (iii) Utilizing synchronized cells,         investigate possible differences in the distribution of the HMG-I and           HMG-Y proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm during different phases        of the cell cycle.  (iv) Investigate possible differences in chromosomal        localization of the HMG-I and HMG-Y proteins on mitotic chromosomes.            The results of these experiments may provide important clues to the             biological function of these proteins.",
