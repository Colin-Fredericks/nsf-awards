 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Beers will complete an objective prism survey of the northern               and southern hemispheres of our Galaxy and then follow up on                    selected stars which have extremely low metal abundances and                    stars on the horizontal branch of their evolutionary track.  The                final database of candidates should include about 16,000 stars                  with relatively low abundances of iron, and about 25,000                        horizontal branch stars will be identified.                                                                                                                     The halo of our Galaxy contains less than 1 percent of the                      luminous stars in the entire Galaxy.  Yet the halo is fundamental               for revealing crucial issues of stellar evolution, the processes                of galaxy formation and evolution, and for constraining the                     distribution of matter throughout the Galaxy.  To understand the                halo, one must first find it and characterize it.  Ideally,                     complete spectroscopic and photometric information for the                      approximately one billion luminous stars which populate the halo                would allow the observer to draw a picture of the halo which is                 untainted by sampling bias.  Short of this, one can only attempt                to minimize the effects of any selection criteria which must be                 imposed to make the problem tractable.  In its broadest sense,                  the purpose of Dr. Beers' survey is to discover the objects which               will, eventually, allow for a much more complete understanding of               the halo of our Galaxy.",
