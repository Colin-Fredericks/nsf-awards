 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is the aim of this project to upgrade an existing facility used o            determine flow velocities in a laboratory experiment associated                 with a fluid mechanics course.  The facility currently uses a                   single-channel laser-doppler velocimeter (LDV), which limits                    measurements to one dimension.  Flow systems of engineering                     interest are rarely one dimensional.  This facility is upgraded to a            double-base system which can measure two components of flow                     velocity simultaneously.  Experiments to be performed illustrate                more completely the concepts of fluid mechanics taught in the                   course and train the students in the theory and use of a state-of-              the-art instrument.                                                                                                                                             Laser-doppler velocimetry has made possible the measurement of                  flow velocities with much greater accuracy and precision than was               possible previously.  In addition, it is a non-invasive technique               not strongly dependent upon the properties and composition of the               flow medium and can be used over a velocity range of more than six              orders of magnitude.  Because of these reasons, it is widely used               to measure flow conditions in wind tunnels, narrow passages,                    rotating machinery, combustion systems, flames, and plasmas.",
