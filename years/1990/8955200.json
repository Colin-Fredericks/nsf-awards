 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year teacher enhancement project will provide in-                    service science content and pedagogy instruction to 80                          teachers from 40 middle and high schools.  It will emphasize                    the use of meteorological observations to facilitate the                        development of scientific concepts and process skills which                     are relevant to students' everyday lives.  Teachers will                        learn to use and maintain a network of computer linked                          weather stations for classroom instructions.  The project                       includes academic year in-service courses, annual fall and                      spring conferences, annual three-week summer workshops and                      academic year classroom visits by professional                                  meteorologists.  The project begins with workshops for 30                       teachers in the summer of 1990.  Participants may earn six                      graduate credits from Portland State University for the                         summer workshops and (1-4) credits for the academic year                        work.  Working scientists are ongoing participants and the                      resources of public and private schools are combined with                       those of the university, business community, and professional                   organizations and agencies.  The cooperative pooling of human                   and fiscal resources from school districts, universities, the                   business community, professional organizations and other                        agencies, is a compelling feature of this project.                                                                                                              Cost sharing in an amount of $460,219 equals 122% of the NSF                    award.",
