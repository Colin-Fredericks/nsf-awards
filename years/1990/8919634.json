 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Marcy will search for extremely low mass, dark companions to                stars by using the reflex velocity of the host star.  He will use               a new measurement technique which should significantly improve the              precision of radial velocities and permit the detection of stellar              companions with masses as low 3 Jupiter-masses, for orbital periods             up to the duration of the observations.  He hopes to further                    improve the analysis so that companions of even lower mass will be              detectable.                                                                                                                                                     A long standing difficulty in astronomy as been the determination               of the properties of substellar objects, \"stars\" of too little mass             to support stable nuclear hydrogen burning.  Such objects bear on               several diverse subfields of astronomy, such as: (1) the                        identification of unseen matter both in the disk of our Galaxy and              in halos of other galaxies; (2) the understanding of star formation             and protostellar fragmentation at low stellar masses; and (3) the               determination of masses of low mass stars orbited by substellar                 companions to better determine the stellar mass function and the                frequency of binary stars at the low mass end of the main sequence              of stars.  Although there are several interesting candidates, there             are currently no confirmed bona fide substellar objects known                   outside our Solar System.  Dr. Marcy's objective is to use an                   improved observational technique that will permit detection of                  substellar companions of stars down to masses of about 1 Jupiter-               mass.
