 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Diamond is writing a biography of Charlotte Friend, a                       distinguished pioneer in the study of viral oncology and cell                   differentiation.  Friend made two seminal discoveries that had                  a major impact on our understanding of the cancer process.                      At a time when the concept that viruses could cause cancer was                  still viewed with skepticism, she isolated a virus that                         produced a fatal leukemia in mice.  She later showed that                       tumor cells such as those induced by her virus could be                         stimulated to differentiate into normal cells and lose their                    potential to divide.  This study is being made within the                       scientific, intellectual and social contexts of Dr. Friend's                    time.  Among the themes being examined by Dr. Diamond are the                   influence of Friend's discoveries on modern cancer research,                    the challenge and joy of discovery, the struggle to have one's                  unorthodox observations accepted, and the importance in this                    struggle for acceptance of having strong personal and                           institutional support.  Another theme of significance for this                  story is that of women's conflict between family life and a                     life in science.  All of these developments are framed by                       the \"molecular revolution\" and the cognitive/technical                          development of Friend's research within the changing                            intellectual landscape of biomedicine in the DNA era.  This                     biography should be of interest to scientists, historians and                   laymen and an inspiration to young men and women who aspire                     to an exciting life in science.",
