 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                               Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. Gregory S. Girolami will                  synthesize and study soluble models of the heterogeneous                        catalysts used widely for the industrial synthesis of such                      polymers as polyethylene, the so-called Ziegler-Natta                           catalysts. The results of the project are expected to aid in                    the identification of the species responsible for the catalytic                 activity and in the formulation of a detailed mechanism for the                 catalytic process.                                                                                                                                              Homogeneous models of Ziegler-Natta catalysts will be                           synthesized and studied, with particular emphasis on the                        preparation and reactivity of electronically unsaturated alkyl                  derivatives of the early transition elements. Among the effects                 to be examined are the unexpected spin-state changes which                      occur as a result of the extremely strong pi-electron donation                  by the early transition metals, e.g., those of group 4, to                      ligand acceptor orbitals. Although octahedral geometries are                    generally assumed for Ziegler-Natta catalysts, d-zero metal                     alkyls can adopt non-octahedral geometries, and the role of the                 latter geometries in the catalytic process will be probed.                      Studies of new chromium-based polymerization systems and                        mechanistic studies related to the thermolysis of transition                    metal alkyls will be pursued also.",
