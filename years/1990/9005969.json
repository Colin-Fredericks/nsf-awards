 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research which uses the              framework of mathematical economics to model the coordination of                amultitude of computational units engaged in large-scale problem                solving.  The authors are working on developing a detailed formalism            of a massively parallel computing system that lends itself to a                 representation as an economic resource allocation problem.  A                   computation will be regarded as a production process that yields a              specific output and requires certain inputs.  Just as production of             commodities are organized into parallel and serial stages with                  intermediate goods, a computational problem will be organized into              parallel and serial steps with intermediate outputs.  Inputs and                outputs will be priced, and profits will be defined for each                    computational unit.  Entry and exit of individual units based on                rofitability can be interpreted as a form of adaptive learning.                 Mathematical economic will allow the characterization of optimal                prices that will achieve the system objective efficiently.  The                 authors will study the existence, optimality, and stability of                  equilibrium prices and allocations, the practical implementation of             this economic solution, and the potential learning behavior driven              by profitability.  The research is significant in that it explores              the way in which knowledge from economic science and knowledge                  fromcomputer science can be integrated to produce new knowledge.",
