Geography will be viewed as an integrating science, treating                    physical, biological, and cultural components as interrelated                   parts of a whole.  The series will present a satellite's eye                    view of the earth, utilizing the best available imagery from                    satellite, photographic coverage, maps, animation, and                          computer generated imagery.  Program topics will include                        global systems and remote sensing, patterns of settlement,                      geologic processes, local impacts of global markets, climatic                   zones and climatic changes, oceans of the world, rivers and                     lakes, forests of the world, feast or famine, and ethnicity                     and technology.                                                                                                                                                      The Producers, Nigel Calder and Nicholas Barton, are                       experienced writers and producers of science book and films.                    They will be supported by an internationally recognized team                    of senior consultants and advisors.  SPACESHIP EARTH will be                    complemented by educational materials packages for wide use                     in formal and informal settings, and U.S. precollege teachers                   will have unlimited three year off air tape and reuse rights                    to the series.                                                                                                                                                       This series promises to be an engaging and fresh                           approach to science through global views of geography, with                     substantial appeal to educators and schools as well as at                       home viewers.  NSF's contribution will be 13% of the total.",
