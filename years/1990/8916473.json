 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary controversy has                     matured to the point where it is important to document the mosaic                                                                                               of environmental and geologic processes that encompassed the                    earth 66 m.y. ago., especially in the classic continental                       sections in western North America and in the classic marine                     sections in Scandinavia.  PI's will test the contention that                    basaltic volcanism was a dominant progenitor of the Mg-smectite                 clay mineral in the (K/T) boundary clay unit in Scandinavia, and                                                                                                (2) will assess the role of basaltic volcanism in producing Ir                  anomalies.  We have reported a significant new evidence that the                                                                                                K/T boundary clay unit at Stevns Klint (the Fish Clay), which is                                                                                                dominantly composed of an unusual Mg-smectite clay, is formed by                                                                                                alteration of basaltic pyroclastic ash as opposed to being formed                                                                                               from impact derived glass or ejecta.  A basaltic pyroclastic                    origin is supported by our finding of large subhedral labradorite                                                                                               grains in layer III of the Fish Clay.  Our initial findings also                                                                                                suggest that basaltic volcanism took place before, during and                   after the deposition of shocked quartz in the Fish Clay.

The geographically confined Skane basalts which heretofore have                 provided an unrealistically wide range of dates (150 m.y - 80                   m.y) will be redated, paying close attention to avoiding                        xenolithic contamination.",
