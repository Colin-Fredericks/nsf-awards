 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                               investigation project in learning from this damaging                            event.                                                                                                                                                          The thrust of this project is to evaluate the performance                       of university buildings located at the campus of the                            University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) from the                       damage observations and seismic behavior analysis.                                                                                                              The UCSF campus has gradually grown over the years to now                       encompass 80 buildings located throughout San Francisco.                        As such the campus exhibits a wide range of building                            types and standards and, in addition, strong motion                             records are available for this site from the California                         Division of Mines and Geology, thus making it ideally                           suited for this evaluation.                                                                                                                                     Several buildings of different types will be chosen for                         detailed evaluations.  Evaluation methods from the                              Applied Technology Council ATC-14 document will be                              employed to perform consistent, realistic, cost effective                       assessments of the performance during the Loma Prieta                           earthquake of the existing buildings against their                              standards of record.  Observed damage, causes of any                            failures, likely building responses, actual and potential                       life-safety hazards, and capacity/demand margins for the                        Loma Prieta and future earthquakes with respect to UCSF                         buildings will be identified and discussed.  These                              findings will be extended to behavior of university                             buildings in general with respect to their standard code                        of record in a final report to be issued at project                             completion.                                                                                                                                                     The building stock of a variety of construction types and                       ages will enable the seismic performance of older                               buildings be evaluated and the associated generic                               potential life-safety hazards be rectified.",
