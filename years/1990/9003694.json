 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this work will be the study of monotonicity and               symmetry properties of solutions of partial differential                        equations.  Equations of interest include those arising in                      modeling vibrations and in nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  They               fall into the classes known as fully nonlinear elliptic and                     parabolic equations.  One is interested in understanding                        solutions where the minimal period is prescribed or the nature of               the singularity where a solution ceases to exist (blow up).                     Progress in the first case has been made; the major obstacle to                 be overcome rests with the complexity of the infinite dimensional               kernel of the wave operator.  Development in the study of blow up               of solutions of the Schrodinger equation have advanced                          considerably in the past decade.  It has been shown that when the               spatial domain is star-shaped, solutions do blow up in finite                   time.  Work will continue in this vein to understand better the                 nature of the singularity and to obtain sharper estimates                       regarding the time at which the blow up can be expected.                        Currently, many related estimates are very crude.  The onset of                 blow up is not yet known to have physical significance because                  the minimal possible time may be exponentially large.                                Other work will investigate the existence, uniqueness and                  spatial decay properties of solutions of traveling waves arising                from dynamics and combustion problems.",
