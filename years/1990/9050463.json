 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project developments a \"curriculum model\" for the integration of           mechanical design and manufacturing.  The design process begins by              converting a concept into a database using Computer Aided Drafting              (CADD).  The project equipment is used in the study of computerized             manufacturing systems and utilizes the CADD geometry files as the basis         1)for Computer Aided Design (CAD), especially analysis with finite              element analysis, and 2)for Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM)                  including the creation and execution of Computer Numerical Control              (CNC) part programs.  Learning progresses from topics courses in                mechanical design and manufacturing to a \"capstone\" semester-long group         design project integrating the design and the manufacture of a product.         The equipment support for this undertaking includes six (6) CAD/CAM             workstations with appropriate peripherals and software; and two (2)             manufacturing workcells consisting of a CNC milling machine, a CNC              lathe, an educational robot, a vision system, bar code system,                  manufacturing system components and a Statistical Process Control               System.                                                                                                                                                         The award is being matched with a greater amount (102%) by the                  principal investigator's institution.",
