 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become increasingly clear in recent years that the                  quantitative study of ionosphere-thermosphere dynamics can be                   most effective through global, multitechnique investigations.                   Observational techniques and modeling efforts have progressed to                such a level that those studies are now feasible.  Indeed, the                  CEDAR initiative in this country as well as the international                   World Ionosphere Thermosphere Study (WITS) and Solar-Terrestrial                Energy Program (STEP) of SCOSTEP have been planned exactly in                   response to such a challenge.  The World Acoustic Gravity Study                 (WAGS) is an important part of these programs.                                  Acoustic gravity waves, and the associated traveling ionospheric                disturbances (TIDS) have been the subject of many theoretical and               experimental studies.  A series of landmark theoretical papers by               Hines (1960).                                                                        Because of the large spatial coherence of the auroral-                     generated large-scale TIDs, it is imperative that world wide                    observational campaigns be conducted if one wants to study the                  overall source-generation-propagation mechanisms associated with                these waves.  WAGS was designed for this purpose.",
