 "awd_abstract_narration": "The bacterium cytophaga johnsonae moves by gliding motility, which              means that the cells possess no flagella and are incapable of                   swimming but can translocate over surfaces with which they come in              contact.  The molecular machinery underlying gliding motility has               not been identified, nor have the mechanisms that regulate the                  movements of gliding bacteria. The proposed research is based on                previous work with wild-type cells and nonmotile mutants of C.                  johnsonae showing characteristic movements of cell surface components           and identifying membrane proteins involved in cell movements.  These            proteins will be purified and characterized, with particular                    attention to their glyconjugates.  The long-term objective is                   to explain the mechanisms and regulation of gliding in Cytophaga                johnsonae.  The Cytophaga - Flexibacter group is an important and               ubiquitous group of bacteria, present in soil and water, and                    important  in turnover of macromolecules of all kinds, including                chitin, cellulose, agar, and carageenan.  Some members of the group             are pathogens of fish or shellfish, or plant pathogens involved in              soft-rot of vegetables. The have also been implicated as agents of              tooth decay in humans, and responsible for a lung disease seen in               textile mill workers.",
