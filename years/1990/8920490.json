 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials Research Laboratory (MRL) at Harvard University                   supports interactive and interdisciplinary materials research in                three primary thrust areas.  Phase Transitions and Failure                      Mechanisms:  Metals, Ceramics and Superconductors represents a                  synthesis of core materials science efforts in phase transitions                and superconductivity with ongoing collaborative work in                        micromechanics.  Activities in the thrust span a range of                       materials scales from atoms to grains to polycrystals to                        composites; the research addresses the relationships between                    macroscopic properties and microstructural features.  The thrust                on Thin Films, Interfaces, and Surfaces focuses primarily on the                links between chemistry and physics, and deals with the                         fundamental properties of a wide range of thin-film materials and               structures.  These include liquid-crystal films, polymerized                    membranes, self-assembled monolayers, liquid helium films and                   liquid metal surface morphologies, surface reconstructions, and                 two-dimensional arrays of Josephson junctions.  A newly organized               effort on Microelectronic Materials addresses the electronic                    properties of compound semiconductor heterostructures with graded               composition; novel approaches to synthesis and characterization                 of epitaxial semiconductors and liquid metal mediated crystal                   growth; and atomic transport semiconductor materials.                                                                                                           The Harvard MRL also supports the development, operation and                    maintenance of major central research facilities including a                    surface facility operated in collaboration with the MIT MRL.  The               MRL provides seed funding for new faculty and for high-risk                     projects in materials research that are related to its overall                  program.  The MRL program currently involves 24 faculty members,                8 postdoctoral research associates, 18 graduate students, 8                     undergraduates through the Research Experiences for                             Undergraduates program, and 7 other scientific and technical                    professionals.                                                                                                                                                  The Harvard MRL is directed by Professor Henry Ehrenreich. //",
