 "awd_abstract_narration": "The type of computing environment dawning on the engineering               campus is significantly different from that which was available                 just a few years ago and is radically different from the                        environment under which traditional mechanical design education                 developed.                                                                      %%%                                                                                  The aims of this research are the development of a                         mathematical model for the mechanical design process and the                    development of prototype teaching aid for a computer environment.               Such a computer aid will provide an interactive, self-paced problem             drill environment. In addition, it will provide an electronic                   workbench for problem solving. The major thrust of the work will                be the development of a quantitative theory for the design process              that will then allow the exploitation of the full power of a                    workstation computer environment in mechanical engineering                      education. A general set of software, hopefully applicable to other             disciplines, will be tested through the development of several sets             of course materials for mechanical engineering design courses. The              study will conclude with an evaluation of the technical and                     educational merits of such a system.",
