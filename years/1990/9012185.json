 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research funding agencies are now insisting that investigators make             research data developed with their support accessible to others.                The goals are to encourage openness and integrity in science, to                ensure efficient use of research funds, and to provide training                 resources.  This project examines data sharing behavior by creating             a field experiment in which shared data are requested, used, and                archived in a large and divrse teaching university.  The project                investigates how social scientists respond when asked for their                 data, what problems (e.g., ethical, attitudinal, financial) inhibit             data sharing and how these may be mitigated; and what impact data               sharing has on the interests, openness, and research activity of                students and faculty who request and use data, and attend the                   workshops that are part of the project.  The project will produce               findings on data sharing and non-sharing behavior, findings on the              uses, benefits, problems and teaching of data-sharing, particularly             in primarily teaching universities, and models for university                   support for data sharing.  Project results will be useful to                    science policy makers who seek to improve the effectiveness of data             sharing, to faculty who want to use shared data in teaching                     research values and skills, and to university service and                       administrative staff who want to improve faculty and student skills             in data use.                                                                                                                                                    This study grows out of the successful completion of a planning                 phase, which resulted in a session on data sharing at the AAAS                  annual meeting in 1989, in several articles published in IRB and                elsewhere, and in a collection of papers under review for                       publication.  Co-principal investigators are very well-qualified;               institutional support is very good; the field research plans are                good and should provide rich information about opportunities for                and constraints on data sharing.  Results will be widely                        disseminated and relevant to both researchers and educational                   policymakers.  Support is recommended.",
