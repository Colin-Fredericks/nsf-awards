The activities of the Board                      benefit the chemical sciences where continued health is a                       major concern of the NSF Divisions of Chemistry (MPS) and                       Chemical and Thermal Systems (Engineering).  The Board, in the                                                                                                  past, managed the studies on \"Separation & Purification\" and                    \"Frontiers in Chemical Engineering\" for the CTS Division and,                   before that, the \"Opportunities in Chemistry\" for the                           Chemistry Division.                                                                                                                                             Co-funding of the BCST by NSF helps it continue its tradition                   of service to the discipline of chemistry, biochemistry, and                    chemical engineering by planning studies on important issues                    and by providing the means by which study recommendations can                   be disseminated and acted upon.                                                                                                                                 Over the next three years, the Board hopes to formulate a                       number of major initiatives, including the following:                                                                                                                o    stimulating the development of an improved                                 introductory chemistry curriculum;                                              o    improving the management of chemical laboratory                            safety in academic institutions;                                                o    providing guidance on optimal strategies for the                                design, construction, and renovation of chemical                                laboratory facilities;                                                     o    continuing coordinated dissemination efforts for the                                                                                                            chemistry and chemical engineering survey reports;                         and                                                                             o    initiating a series of short, highly visible                                    reports/symposia to highlight especially promising                              chemical research frontiers.  One such report was                               recently started on \"Catalyst Science and                                  Technology\" under the chairmanship of Alexis Bell of the                        University of California-Berkeley, Department of Chemical                                                                                                            Engineering.",
