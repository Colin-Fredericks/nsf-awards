 "awd_abstract_narration": "Colgate University is providing students with an opportunity to                 examine the nervous system at the biochemical level.  The project               is having an impact on the Neuroscience curriculum on two levels.               First, the project is providing equipment for a laboratory section              that enables juniors and seniors to learn basic biochemical                     methodology.  The students isolate and characterize subcellular                 fractions from central nervous system tissue.  The fractions are                analyzed for biochemical markers (enzymatic activity), by SDS-                  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots, and for lipids.             At the second level, the students are designing senior thesis                   projects that address problems at the biochemical level utilizing               the equipment in the project.  Two specialized pieces of equipment              are being used.  The first is a system that runs, stains, and                   destains SDS-polyacrylamide gels in 1 hr.  In addition, transfer                of polypetides to nitrocellulose in preparation for immunoblot                  analysis is accomplished in 15 min.  The second is a                            spectrophotometer equipped with 6 wells to allow for the                        simulataneous acquisition of kinetic data from 6 samples.  The                  project brings to the Neuroscience curriculum fundamental methods               and techniques for the examination of the biochemical properties                of the nervous system.                                                                                                                                          The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
