 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project DEVELOP is a six-week summer workshop with an                           academic year follow-up that emphasizes the development of                      teaching content, critical thinking skills and leadership                       techniques in field biology, ecology, and geology for newer                     or less well prepared middle and high school teachers.  Over                    two years, forty participants will be selected from Western                     and Central Ohio and Eastern Indiana.                                                                                                                           The first three weeks will provide an introduction to the                       principles of ecology and geology, thinking skills,                             leadership, and discussion of local resources.  The workshop                    will then travel by vans to the High Altitude Laboratory of                     the University of Denver (at 10,700 feet on the slopes of                       Mt. Evans), where the participants (accompanied by several                      researchers) will spend 15 days investigating the biology and                   geology of the area.  A paved road services the mountaintop                     (14,258 feet).  The area abounds in biological and geological                   topics to study.                                                                                                                                                Workshop participants, with staff assistance, would pass on                     the benefits of their experiences to their students and                         fellow teachers throughout the following academic year.  Each                   participant will develop a teaching module or exercise from                     the summer experience.  These modules are to be shared with                     the participants' colleagues at their own institution and                       with workshop participants.  The development of the modules                     will involve assistance by a mentor team selected from past                     workshop participants.  During the academic year, six evening                   meetings will be held with the participants to discuss their                    module development and implementation.  Additionally, there                     will be several field trips during the academic year to                         identify local resources.  The program participants will                        receive ten semester hours of graduate credit, certificates                     of achievement, and will be recognized by the local media.                                                                                                      An amount equivalent to 30.4% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.//",
