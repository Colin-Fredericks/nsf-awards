Funding will be provided to the National Academy                      of Sciences for this program.                                                   The triennial General Assembly is the principal mechanism for                   URSI activities.  Participation by U.S. delegates in the past                   has resulted in cooperative programs with other nations.  In                    addition, Assembly activities have been published in the                        \"Proceedings of the General Assembly\"; the \"Review of Radio                     Science\"; the \"URSI Information Bulletin\"; and trip reports                     by participants.                                                                As a constituent member of the International Council of                         Scientific Unions (ICSU), URSI receives support from NSF for                    its U.S. membership dues and for activities costs of its U.S.                   National Committee.  The NSF Division of International                          Programs coordinates the activities of NSF in fostering                         international scientific cooperation.  Under the Scientific                     Organizations and Resources Program, U.S. scientists and                        engineers are provided with broad access to the benefits of                     selected nongovernmental international organizations,                           including ICSU.  Support of this travel grant is consonant                      with this activity.                                                             In consideration of the continued merit of URSI as a way of                     providing opportunities for cooperation in a multinational                      and multidisciplinary context, and of the highly satisfactory                   management of U.S. participation through the National Academy                   of Sciences, the program manager recommends an award.",
