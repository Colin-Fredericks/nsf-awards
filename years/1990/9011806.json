 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of the \"rank\" of a demand system is used to unify the               literature concerning the aggregation and functional structure of               demands. The implication of an extended notion of rank for                      aggregation, separability, functional form and welfare comparison               are derived. These are particularly useful because rank is a                    scalar, integer attribute of readily available Engle curve data,                yet this number has implications for the income and price                       structure of the demands and for the appropriate structure of                   models used to estimate and analyze these demands.                                                                                                              A simple new nonparametric techniques for estimating the rank of                demands is derived based on ordinary linear regressions to                      construct a matrix that asymptotically has the same rank as the                 underlying demand system. Applications of other nonparametric                   estimators are also proposed. Kernel and average derivative                     estimation will be used to nonparametrically estimate                           elasticities. They will be combined with rank estimates to                      suggest appropriate levels of separability, aggregation and                     parametric or semiparametric functional forms.                                                                                                                  In developing the new techniques for analyzing demand behavior,                 the methods will be useful in examining cost and welfare                        implications for tax, income redistribution and pricing policies                and describing the differential impact of such policies on                      different demographic groups, including the elderly, single                     parents and the poor. Other potential applications include                      extensions  to production data to reveal analogous information                  about the structure of factor demands and analysis for financial                assets, where rank provides a nonparametric estimate of the                     degree of mutual fund (portfolio) separation. The principal data                sources for the analysis are the Consumer Expenditure Surveys,                  with prices obtained from the U.S. National Income and Product                  Accounts. For comparison purposes, British data will be used.",
