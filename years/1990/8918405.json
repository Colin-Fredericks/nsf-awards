 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal is to understand the virus-cell interactions that occur            during reovirus infection of mammalian cells, with emphasis on                  determining those virus functions that are responsible for metabolic            perturbations and eventual death of the host cell.  Attention will be           focussed on the proteins encoded by the reovirus S1 genome segment, o1,         the virus cell attachment protein, and o1S(p14), whose function is              presently unknown.  The specific objectives are to determine the                function(s) of sigms-1-5 in the replication cycle of reovirus and to            investigate the possible involvement of sigma-1-S in the alteration of          host cell metabolism.  Antibodies have recently been prepared which             react specifically to subcellular fractionation studies designed to             determine the intracellular localization of sigma-1-s during reovirus           multiplication.  The interaction(s) of sigma-1-S with other reovirus and        cellular proteins, or nucleic acids will also be determined.                        The proposed research will help determine the function of o1S and           the effect of both sigma-1-S and sigma-1 on the host cell.  This                information will provide a more complete comprehension of the complex           virus-host cell interactions that occur during virus multiplication.",
