 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of a longer term study,  Dr. Servos is examining the                    history of industrial sponsorship of scientific research on                     university campuses from 1900 to World War II.  Under this grant,               he is studying the evolution of contractual relationships between               universities and industrial firms during that period, focusing on               such issues as the motives and expectations of industrial sponsors,             the relationship between in-house and extramural industrial                     research, the scientific and technical accomplishments of such                  plans, the effects of corporate sponsorship on faculty morale and               ont eh research and educational missions of the academy more                    generally, and the reasons for the rise and decline of such                     relationships during the interwar years.  By studying selected                  examples of efforts to integrate industrial and academic science,               Dr. Servos will enlarge our understanding of the ways that                      industrial and academic research intersected during their early and             formative years and will provide a historical perspective on the                cooperative schemes of the present.",
