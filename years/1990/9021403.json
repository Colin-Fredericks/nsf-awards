This two year project is reporting to the                  Center's Industry Advisory Board.                                                    The project is developing an integrated crack propagation life             prediction capability system dynamic analysis for load prediction,              finite element analysis for stress prediction, and fatigue crack                propagation analysis for fatigue life prediction.  The feasibility              of automating this crack propagation life prediction method for                 mechanical components is being demonstrated in an integrated                    analysis environment.                                                                The Principal Investigator is competent and has the facilities             to perform the research.                                                             The Program Manager recommends that Prairie View A & M                     University be awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.",
