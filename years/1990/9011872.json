 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been claimed by some philosophers of science that                        scientists give greater weight (or should give greater weight)                  to theories that make successful predictions of previously                      unknown facts, than to theories that only explain or deduce                     facts already known.  Professor Brush is examining several                      historical case studies in order to find out whether                            scientists actually follow this rule, and more generally how                    the success or failure of predictions affects the reception                     of theories.  Some possible case studies include Einstein's                     prediction of the gravitational bending of light;  Alfven's                     predictions about the behavior of plasmas and electric and                      magnetic fields in the magnetosphere and interplanetary space,                  the prediction of the positron from Dirac's relativistic                        quantum mechanics, electromagnetic waves from Maxwell's                         theory, the prediction of the omega-minus particle from Gell-                   Mann's \"eight-fold way\" symmetry theory, Clairaut's prediction                  of the date when Halley's comet would return, and Mendeleev's                   prediction of new chemical elements to fill the gaps in his                     periodic table.  The results of this research should help to                    clarify the reasons why scientists accept or reject theories.",
