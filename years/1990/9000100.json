 "awd_abstract_narration": "All 37 species of monitor lizards are considered as                        threatened or endangered.  Habitat destruction and human                        intervention have caused serious disturbances in numerous                       populations of these lizards (genus Varanus).  Complicating this                decrease in diversity is that monitor lizards do not reproduce                  well in captivity.  Indeed successful captive propagation of                    selected species has only occurred after sufficient behavioral                  and physiological information has been collected from natural                   populations.  With permission from the Department of Nature                     Conservation in Namibia, Africa, Dr. Phillips will study savanna                monitor lizards in their natural habitat.  Integrating a series                 of field and laboratory studies, he and his colleague, Dr. Pratt,               will determine the hormonal correlates of behavior in males and                 females, examine the environmental and social conditions required               for successful hatching of eggs, and determine what causes                      reproductive dysfunction in captive female monitor lizards.                     Not only will these findings provide baseline data from which the               other varanid species can be compared, but the establishment of                 ecophysiological data base that emphasizes the behavioral and                   endocrinological aspects of natural reproduction could proved a                 proximate solution for maintaining viable populations.  Indeed                  information originating from this work is essential to establish                successful captive breeding programs which will allow for the                   preservation of the species and the eventual reintroduction of                  these monitor lizards into the wild.",
