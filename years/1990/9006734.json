 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seed dormancy mechanisms are widespread among tropical                     plants that colonize small-scale disturbances (e.g.,                            treefalls),and presumably evolved because disperses deposit most                seeds in inappropriate habitats (i.e., beneath intact forest                    canopies).  Most colonists indeed arrive before gap formation,                  but the typical \"residence time\" of seeds in the soil before gap                information is unknown.  How long seeds persist in the soil is                  dependent upon the rates at which they are \"removed,\" both by                   predators and by exceeding inherent limits of viability.  Rates                 of removal from the soil have profound consequences for such                    \"pioneer\" plants and the communities in which they occur: species               composition in patches recovering from natural or anthropogenic                 disturbance is largely determined by the composition of the seed                bank at the time of disturbance.  In addition, seed removal rates               mediate the fitness increments associated with different ripening               schedules and with dispersal by different animals.  This study                  will take advantage of extensive background data on germination                 requirements, seed dormancy, and bird-generated seed shadows in                 Costa Rican pioneer plants to evaluate these effects.  Through                  several controlled, replicated field experiments, the P.I. will                 measure rates if seed input to and removal from the soil seed                   bank, and then examine the consequences of seed demography for                  community structure and the evolution of ripening phenologies and               plant-disperser relationships.  This work will have important                   implications for analyses of tropical forest dynamics.",
