 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monodispersed dendritic macromolecules having controlled                   surface functionality will be prepared by two methods. The first                involves a novel \"convergent\" approach in which growth of the                   macromolecule starts at what will become its external surface and               proceeds inwards through repeated coupling of a polyfunctional                  monomer to the single reactive group of the growing polymer,                    while the second method uses a more classical solid-phase                       approach.  The \"convergent growth\" approach provides unparalleled               control of both the number and the spatial location of the                      functional groups at the outer surface of the final spheroidal                  macromolecule.  Once prepared, the dendritic molecules will be                  used to prepare new macromolecular assemblies with unusual                      architectures and properties.  This will be done through                        modification of the surface functional groups in processes                      involving grafting, block polymerization, or coupling reactions.                In particular, the growth of linear polymer chains form                         controlled locations on the outer surface of dendritic                          macromolecules will be studied.  The synthesis of these new                     macromolecular assemblies will lead to new materials with novel                 properties resulting from their unusual topology, their uniform                 small size (30-100) A), their symmetrical or unsymmetrical                      surface functionalization, the existence of strong molecular                    dispoles, the presence of chirality, etc.  Applications of these                new materials are anticipated in areas as varied as molecular                   transport, catalysis, and optoelectronics.",
