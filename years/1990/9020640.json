 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of North Carolina Educational Computing Service                  (UNC-ECS) provides computing and networking services for over forty             small educational institutions including the nineteen institutions              participating in this proposal.  The nineteen include thirteen                  campuses of the University of North Carolina, four private colleges             or universities, the North Carolina School of Science and                       Mathematics (a State-funded high school for outstanding students),              and the National Humanities Center.  The UNC campuses include five              minority institutions.  The UNC-ECS runs a data network which                   connects through the mid-level network SURANET to NSFNET.  The                  proposal requests funds to upgrade the network connections of nine              institutions, and provide \"NSF recognition\" to eight others to                  enable them to qualify for reduced annual dues to SURANET.  Wake                Forest University and the National Humanities Center, included in               the nineteen, do not participate financially in the proposal.                   Access to NSFNET provides the faculty and students with access to               supercomputers, data archives, a variety of network gateways,                   automated library catalogs, and a wide range of software.  Primary              applications include file transfers, electronic mail communication              between local and remote researchers, and remote login to and use               of supercomputers and other research facilities.",
