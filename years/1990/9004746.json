 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is focused on three inter-related                         questions concerning regulation of muscle contraction:  the                     molecular basis for calcium-dependent control by myosin, the                    role of protein phosphorylation and filament architecture in                    regulating long-lasting contractions, and the structure and                     dynamics of the calcium-pumping protein assembly in the                         sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane.  In each case, the goal is to                  relate the detailed structure and properties of individual                      protein molecules to the architecture and dynamics of the                       native protein assemblies in muscle.  Drs. Vibert and Cohen                     have established that certain invertebrate muscles are                          especially suitable for these investigations, and that their                    structural and regulatory properties are of general                             significance for contraction in many muscle types, including                    those of vertebrates.  In the next phase of this program,                       application of advanced methods of electron microscopy -                        especially cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified samples -                      should provide images of higher resolution and fidelity than                    have been produced in the past.  Coupled with the use of                        proteins altered by site-directed mutagenesis, and of specific                  antibodies, these structural approaches should allow them to                    integrate findings at the molecular level into a picture of                     regulation in whole muscle.  Knowledge of the structure and                     switching of the protein assemblies that regulate muscle                        contraction involves understanding inter-related control                        systems at a higher level of organization than any yet                          achieved.",
