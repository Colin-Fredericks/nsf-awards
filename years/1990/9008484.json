 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a \"Research Opportunity for Women / Research                   Planning Grant\" pilot project by a young cultural anthropologist                who will study a low-caste village in Sri Lanka to examine the                  village-level consequences of radical changes in the national                   economy of this developing state. The investigator has done                     research in this village before and the pilot study will allow                  her to apply macro-level economic theory to this micro-case of                  development.  The specific issues to be examined are to explain                 the villages apparent economic development in an environment of                 economic hardship.                                                                                                                                              This project is important because it supports the scientific                    research of a young woman investigator, and helps her develop her               potential for doing large-scale scientific research.  The topic                 of explaining variation in the economic development of poor                     developing-country villages is an important one, as only by                     examining and understanding the successful cases of local-level                 village development can we help planners develop policies to                    stimulate thus development on a broad scale.",
