 "awd_abstract_narration": "5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is the first committed intermediate                 in the biosynthesis of the hemes, chlorophylls, corrins and other               naturally-occurring cyclic and linear tetrapyrrolic compounds.                  In animals, yeast and some bacteria, ALA is synthesized from                    glycine and succinyl CoA (C4 pathway).  In higher plants, algae                 and cyanobacteria it is synthesized from glutamate (C5 pathway).                It had been assumed that E. coli followed the C4 pathway, but it                has been shown conclusively, using radiolabelling experiments,                  that E. coli uses the C5 pathway, although it can use a foreign                 C4 pathway gene when it is introduced on a plasmid.  This project               will (1) isolate and characterize mutants in ALA biosynthesis,                  (2) use them to clone the C5 pathway genes, (3) identify and                    characterize the gene products, (4) reconstitute and characterize               the C5 enzymatic pathway, and (5) use in vivo and in vitro                      techniques to study levels of control (transcriptional,                         translational and enzymatic) of ALA biosynthesis in E. coli.                                                                                                    Heme is a necessary component of a number of important biological               compounds.  Chlorophyll and hemoglobin are two examples of heme                 proteins.  This research will examine the early steps of heme                   biosynthesis in order to better understand the components of the                pathway and its regulation.  These studies are important                        agriculturally because of the potential for improved crop yields                through greater protosynthetic efficiency.  It will also be of                  value in the medical field where an understanding of heme                       biosynthesis is necessary to the understanding of genetic                       disorders which are associated with the pathway.",
