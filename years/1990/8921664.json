 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Office of Special Projects of the Division of               Chemistry provides funds for the partial support of a study by the              Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology (BCST) of the Commission              on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Resources of the National                Academy of Sciences that will identify research frontiers in                    catalysis science and technology.  In recent years, United States               leadership in the catalysis science and technology has been                     increasingly challenged by researchers in Japan and Western                     Europe.  During this period, there has been a growing perception                among U.S. scientists and engineers that research opportunities in              catalysis are becoming less timely and interesting.  It is widely               acknowledged that the size and vigor of the general U.S. effort in              catalysis research is not at the level needed to effectively meet               future national needs and international challenges.  The BCST                   believes that the scientific basis for further advances in                      catalysis is strong, and that a high-visibility report offering a               substantive discussion of research frontiers could do much to                   focus attention on new directions in the field and to serve as a                brief guide to promising research areas for a broad national                    audience.                                                                                                                                                       This project, which is jointly supported by the Division of                     Chemistry and the Division of Chemical and Thermal Systems of the               NSF, the U.S. Army Research Office, the U.S. Department of Energy,              and other sources, will bring together some eight distinguished                 academic and industrial researchers to draw input from the                      chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, molecular biology,               solid state physics, and materials science communities,                         assimilate that input, and craft a forty-page report that will be               widely publicized and distributed to academic and industrial                    researchers.",
