About 85-90 regions will be collected.  Dating analyses in the TL               laboratory in Bellingham will be conducted.                                          This project will build upon the previous detailed testing of              TL dating methods conducted by the PI on loess from North Island.               Further test will be conducted on a few known-age South Island                  Loess samples (remote from sources of volcanic feldspars in North               Island), and extensive applications of reliable partial-bleach                  procedures will be made to several undated key loess sections                   throughout South Island.  The resultant loess chronology will be                related to the development of associated Quaternary features such               as marine terraces, glacial outwash deposits and river terraces.                TL dates for such features and for several buried soils in the                  loess sequences will reveal the timing of environmental changes in              much of South Island, in the targeted time window of 20-200 ka.",
