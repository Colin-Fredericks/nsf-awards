The main objective of this interdisciplinary                      meeting is to bring together specialists from various fields such               as engineering, physics, materials science, and mathematics and                 contrast their views on mechanical behavior with emphasis on                    plastic flow and fracture.  Emphasis will be put on nonlinearity                and pattern forming instabilities, as well as their implications                into the understanding of the mechanical behavior of novel                      high-technological materials.  The relevance of the notions of                  bifurcation, self organization, fractals, and chaos will                        critically be examined for the case of solids and the their                     microstructures.  In this connection, the outstanding problem of                the transition from microscales to macroscales will again be                    addressed.",
