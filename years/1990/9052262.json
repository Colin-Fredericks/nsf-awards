 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project enables mechanical engineering students to conduct                 ultra-high temperature experiments.  The equipment purchased includes           an electric furnace capable of reaching 1950 K, and a data                      acquisition system for recording and processing experimental data.              The laboratory improves the offering in materials science by                    permitting the study of the mechanical properties of ceramics.  It              also allows students in Heat Power Design and Senior Independent                Courses to consider potential processes that use high temperature               solar energy as a substitute for those that currently consume                   conventional fossil fuels.  Students experimentally investigate                 chemical reactions adaptable to such processes. The experience with             ceramics heightens undergraduate students' awareness of materials               other than just conventional steel and nonferrous alloys.  It further           serves to illustrate chemical reactions that may become a part of               pioneering processes while increasing interest in energy and                    environmental research. The award is being matched by an equal amount           from the principal investigator's institution.",
