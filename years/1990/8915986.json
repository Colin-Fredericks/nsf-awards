 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award should complete an isotopic investigation into the                   origins of the Cameroon line, a 1600 km. long chain of volcanoes                and plutons which is unique in that it traverses both oceanic and               continental lithosphere.  Recent published work has shown that:                 The basalts have identical chemistry in oceanic and continental                 sectors; Phonolites are common in the oceanic but rare in the                   continental sector; Rhyolites are common in the continental                     sector but absent from the oceanic sector, Amphibole is abundant                in the oceanic sector but scarce in the continental sector; The                 basaltic lavas display a progression to more radiogenic Pb with                 time in both oceanic and continental sectors: There is a                        remarkable lead isotopic anomaly at the continent/ocean boundary                in that the volcanics immediately to either side have a uniform                 highly radiogenic (\"St. Helena type\") signature regardless of                   lead concentration.                                                             So far this project has expanded on the published database and                  presented the first detailed Nd and Pb isotopic studies of some                 of these centers.  The striking near symmetrical change in Pb                   isotopic composition with distance ffrom the continent/ocean                    boundary which has been demonstrated, appears to be due to the                  remelting of upper mantle previously affected by the St. Helena                 plume.  A comprehensive suite of mantle xenoliths from the                      region has been collected, and these will be the focus of                       chemical and isotopic studies this next year.",
