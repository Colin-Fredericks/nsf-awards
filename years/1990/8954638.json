 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement a long-term strategy for upgrading                  the teaching of contemporary genetics in grades 7-12 throughout                 the region in and near the state of Kansas.  Thirty teachers                    per year will be involved with practical, hands-on classroom                    activities which draw upon the state-of-the-art laboratory                      technology that has been developed by mentor teachers working                   in collaboration with scientist in their research laboratories.                 Five mentor teachers per year, research scientists, and a                       research technician with experience in science education                        together with a science educator will comprise the                              instructional team that will teach these activities to other                    well-prepared teachers and some less well-prepared teachers in                  2 three-week summer workshops on the campus of Kansas State                     University during the summers of 1990 and 1991.                                                                                                                 Workshops will use an effective, well-tested format that                        stresses individual mastery of simple lab techniques, updating                  content knowledge and effective strategies.  Topics include                     genetics of yeast, plants (including fast plants) and flour                     beetles and the biological effect of radiation on these                         species. In addition to their work in the development and                       refinement of the activities, the mentor teachers will work                     with the participants during the summer workshop and the                        academic year. The small ratio of mentor teachers to                            participants will facilitate close cooperation and                              reinforcement of the workshop objectives. Mentor teachers will                  be chosen from the same geographical regions as are                             participants to ensure the availability of their expertise.                                                                                                     The use of microcomputers will be an integral component of the                  project both for data analysis and for subsequent networking                    among the teachers in the follow-up phase of the project. An                    existing on-going computer bulletin board-electronic mail                       network, teleconferences and a final weekend conference at a                    professional meeting (e.g. NSTA) will facilitate and ensure an                  ongoing relationship among the participants, the project staff                  and the University researchers.   Objective and subjective                      assessment methods will be used to evaluate both the                            effectiveness of the training and educating of teachers and the                 strengths and weaknesses of this model of development and                       dissemination of innovative science activities in the topic                     areas that are not generally included in secondary biology.                                                                                                     Cost-sharing from The University and the cooperating school                     districts amounts to approximately 30% of the NSF request for                   funds.",
