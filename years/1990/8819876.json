 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans and other higher animals must select relevant information                from the huge amount of data provided by the senses at every                    moment.  The Bloughs' research project seeks to clarify how this                selective process, \"attention,\" works in the case of visual                     information.  They chose the pigeon as their subject because it                 has extremely good vision, unlike most small and inexpensive                    animals studied by biologists and psychologists.  The pigeon is                 an excellent animal model in which to explore how the brain is                  able to interpret the visual world.                                                                                                                             Although most of our understanding of perception and attention                  comes from studying humans, that understanding is limited in a                  number of ways.  Biological processes have always been understood               most deeply by comparing and contrasting them in different                      species.  Learning and motivation play a major role in attention,               and researchers can vary and control these factors in animal                    subjects.  Attention may be simpler and easier to understand in                 pigeons than in humans; humans use complex strategies and thought               processes that may obscure relatively simple mechanisms.  Above                 all, by using an animal subject, the Bloughs hope eventually to                 contribute to the complete understanding of mental processes that               will come only from relating behavioral results directly to                     evidence from physiological experiments in the same species.                    This understanding of neural processes is a major goal of science               and a necessary background for the treatment of behavioral and                  mental disorders.",
