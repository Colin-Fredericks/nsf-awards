 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Susan McIntosh, Mr. Tereba Togola will                conduct archaeological survey and excavation in the Mema or \"Dead               Delta\" region of Mali.  The results of this work will form the                  basis for his doctoral dissertation.  The Mema, as                              geomorphological data indicates, was once a well watered region                 which coincided with the inland delta of the Niger River.  A                    change in the river's course has turned the region to desert.                   The small amount of archaeological research which has been done                 in the region indicates that it contains archaeological sites                   which probably span several millennia.  Areal photographs,                      however, indicate that the region is dotted with possibly                       hundreds of \"tells\" or habitation mounds.  Past uncontrolled                    excavations recovered such artifacts as statuettes of horseman,                 iron spear and arrowheads, and multi-legged vases.  However,                    faunal and floral remains were not collected and the subsistence                base for this culture remains unknown.  Likewise neither an                     absolute nor a relative chronology exists.  Through a combination               of survey, correlation of sites with ancient landforms, and                     excavation at several sites, Mr. Togola will collect both                       chronological and subsistence information.                                                                                                                      This project is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  fill in what is almost a complete archaeological blank.  It will                provide information on how cultures at a very simple level of                   technology adapted to a rigorous Saharan environment and,                       hopefully, shed light on the development of agriculture                         pastoralism and early iron working in sub-Saharan Africa.  It                   should also provide information on the rise of African kingdoms.                Finally, it will aid in the training of an extremely promising                  young scientist.",
