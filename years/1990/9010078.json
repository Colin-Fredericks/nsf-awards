 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several new formulations are proposed to overcome the multi-                    frequency and non-uniqueness problems of the boundary element                   method in elastodynamics.  For the multi-frequency problem, two                 improved boundary element techniques are proposed to make the                   analysis for an entire frequency spectrum possible and practical.               The first technique is to interpolate the \"neutralized\" boundary                element coefficient matrices in the frequency domain; the second                technique is to interpolate the Green function in the spatial                   domain.  Both techniques are suitable for vectorization and                     parallelization on supercomputers.  For the non-uniqueness problem,             two \"enhanced CHIEF\" methods are proposed to ensure the uniqueness              and accuracy of the boundary element solution for an exterior wave              propagation problem.  Vectorized and parallelized codes based on                the proposed formulations will also be made.  Application areas                 include structural vibration, elastic wave propagation and earth-               structure interaction.",
