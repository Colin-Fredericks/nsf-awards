The objectives           of the program are to 1) develop the mental processes of the student            to identify and creatively solve research problems in biophysical               systems, 2) provide research examples through seminars, literature              reviews and active interaction in research projects with faculty and            industrial personnel, and 3) enhance the written and oral                       communication ability of participating students through presentation            of research procedures and findings.  The program is designed to                supplement the existing strong design component of the curriculum and           encourage future research involvement of participating students.                Educational programs including seminars, course work and stimulating            research projects have been planned to instill an interest in and               enthusiasm for future research activities.  Several research projects           applying biophysical processes have been initiated.  A program to               locate and actively recruit academically qualified students has been            developed to ensure success of the overall education effort.",
