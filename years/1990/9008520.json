 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will continue his important studies of               three major areas of nonlinear wave theory:  nonlinear dispersive               waves, focussing of weak shock waves at caustics and catastrophic               instabilities in square-wave detonations.  The methods of study                 involve the use of analytic and asymptotic techniques                           supplemented with numerical analysis.  Such a combined approach                 is called for because the phenomena under study occur at the                    boundaries of existing theories.  Many phenomena in nature cannot               be described adequately with linear models;  nature is inherently               \"nonlinear\".  The proposed research involves the study of wave                  motions that are described by nonlinear differential equations.                 A good example is the \"breaking\" of an ocean wave as it                         approaches the beach.  In order to describe the behavior of such                a nonlinear wave the principal investigator will use asymptotic                 analysis in concert with numerical analysis to obtain qualitative               and quantitative information.",
