The objectives of the meeting are: to                   make a comprehensive in-depth presentation of the current                       status of the mathematical theory of control, to discuss its                    potential in theory and application; and to discusss Indian                     scientists' participation in this area.  Topics to be                           included are: Pontryagin Maximum principle; Time-optimal                        control; Linear quadratic feedback control; Robot control                       dynamics; Control of large space structures; Stochastic                         control; Frequency domain theory; Infinite dimensional                          systems; Differential games; Adaptive control; Riccati                          equations; Controlability and observability; Computational                      techniques in optimal control; Nonlinear systems.                                                                                                               Scope:  This project supports participation of U.S.                             scientists in an international meeting where they and other                     participants from Europe and from India will exchange                           information on advances in the area of control.  This is an                     area of increasing importance to industrialized countries as                    well as developing countries.  The exchange of information is                   likely to benefit the U.S. participants by identifying                          potential collaborators from India.  It is clearly of benefit                   to India since the exposure to leaders in the field should                      stimulate research in the field.",
