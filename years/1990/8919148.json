 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Federation of Automatic                                       Control (IFAC) is composed of 44 National                                       Member Organizations (NMO), each one                                            representing the technical societies concerned                                  with automatic control in its own country.                                      The U.S. NMO is the American Automatic Control                                  Council (AACC) consisting of representatives                                    from seven member societies of which the                                        largest is the IEEE Control Systems Society.                                    IFAC sponsors many conferences, but the most                                    important is the triennial World Congress.                                      The 11th such IFAC World Congress will be held                                  August 13-17, 1990 in Tallinn, USSR.  The 12th                                  will be held in Sydney, Australia, in 1993,                                     and the 13th in San Francisco, U.S.A. in 1996.                                                                                                                  The official theme of the 11th IFAC World                                       Congress is \"Automatic control in the service                                   of mankind.\"  One objective of the Congress is                                  to strengthen the connections between theory                                    and applications by including papers whose                                      topics range from basic research to industrial                                  and social applications.  A second objective                                    is to strengthen the cooperation between                                        researchers from various parts of the world,                                    including the U.S. In the past, this                                            conference has been very successful in                                          attracting researchers and other engineers and                                  scientists from all over the world.  The most                                   recent IFAC World Congress, the 10th held in                                    Munich, FRG, in 1987, had an attendance of                                      over 1,500.  Thus, the conference is expected                                   to be a particularly good forum for the                                         exchange of ideas among U.S. and non-U.S.                                       experts in automatic control.                                                                                                                                   The conference will be comprised of invited                                     sessions and regular sessions.  It will                                         address control theory topics as well as                                        applications to industrial controls,                                            manufacturing systems, automation, and other                                    related issues.",
