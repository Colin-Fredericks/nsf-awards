 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Terry J. Delph of Lehigh University for           a long term research visit to the Fraunhofer Institute for Material             Mechanics in Freiburg, West Germany, where he will work primarily               with Dr. Hermann Riedel, head of the High Temperature Materials                 Department.  The goal of this research is to extend a deterministic             model for high-temperature creep damage and failure recently developed          by Dr. Riedel to include various probabilistic features.  They are              interested in features such as random growth of creep damage and                random creep failure times.  The principal avenues of approach                  include integration techniques for stochastic differential equations            and a general expression for the distribution of failure times                  developed by Coleman.                                                                                                                                           As the drive for increased power and efficiency leads to higher                 operating temperatures for energy conversion devices, structure                 failure modes which were either suppressed or not apparant at lower             temperatures become of greater importance.  One of the most significant         high-temperature failure modes in energy conversion devices is creep            rupture.  The proposed research will provide a description of the               creep damage process that is both physically and probabilistically              based; that is, it will be capable of predicting the probability of             failure by a given time \"t.\"  This will produce much more useful                estimations of structural reliability than current deterministic                models.",
