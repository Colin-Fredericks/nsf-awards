 "awd_abstract_narration": "Globular clusters are well studied systems, because they offer the              opportunity to look on a large number of stars of different masses,             all with pretty much the same age and initial chemical composition.             Much of our knowledge of stellar evolution comes from the study of              these systems.  However, we can, as yet only really look at                     individual stars in very nearby objects, those associated with our              own galaxy, or with the Magellanic Clouds.                                                                                                                      This program is an attempt to enable us to obtain accurate                      information about the chemical composition and age of much more                 distant globular clusters.  The investigators combine                           internationally recognized expertise in the fields of the theory                of stellar atmospheres, spectroscopy and the study of globular                  clusters.  They will utilize computation of model stellar                       atmospheres, stellar evolution calculations, and various luminosity             functions and ages to predict integrated spectra which can be                   measured for distant objects.  They will calibrate their model                  parameters with data from nearby globular clusters for which these              parameters have been determined by other means.",
