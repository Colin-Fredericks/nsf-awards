 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical step in pattern formation in Drosophila is the                       establishment of polarity along the two major body axes. At least               20 maternally active genes are involved in creating dorsal-                     ventral polarity. A variety of experiments have shown that                      dorsal represents the last step in the process, it acts as the                  ventral morphogen relating the maternal positional information to               the zygotic genome. Dr. Steward has cloned and characterized the                dorsal gene and found it is closely related to the vertebrate                   proto-oncogene c-rel. In wild type embryos, the dorsal protein is               present in the cytoplasm during cleavage. After the nuclei                      migrate to the periphery of the embryo, a ventral to dorsal                     gradient of nuclear dorsal protein is established. The formation                of the nuclear gradient is disrupted in mutant embryos from other               maternally active dorsal-ventral polarity genes. In dorsalized                  mutant embryos, only cytoplasmic protein is observed, while in                  ventralized embryos, the nuclear gradient is shifted dorsally.                  Relocalization of the dorsal protein from the cytoplasm to the                  nucleus appears critical for dorsal to function as a morphogen.                 Dr. Steward proposes a number of experiments that address the                   question of what genes either interact with dorsal to effect the                cytoplasmic versus nuclear localization or are essential for                    dorsal function once the protein is in the nucleus. Specifically                she will perform genetic screens to isolate second site                         suppressors of specific dorsal mutations.",
