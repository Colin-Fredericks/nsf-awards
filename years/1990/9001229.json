 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of geographic information systems (GISs) as                analytic tools has been parallelled by attempts to create media that            allow people with varied skills and backgrounds to manipulate and               interpret computer-based spatial data.  The construction of more                effective general user interfaces has been inhibited, however, by the           fact that people structure and deal with geographic relationships in            different ways.  Language influences the ways in which people perceive          spatial relationships, but little attention has been given by scholars          to determining how linguistic differences affect the ways in which              people use GISs.  This doctoral dissertation research project will              examine different ways in which English-speaking and Spanish-speaking           persons describe, structure, and manage spatial relationships.  An oral         questionnaire dealing with common spatial relationships will be                 administered to persons in Spain, Ecuador, and the United States;               persons in those nations also will experiment with different types of           GIS user interfaces to determine if different formats are more                  effective for person speaking different languages.                                   This project will provide a valuable test of different GIS user            interface formats in different linguistic settings, thereby helping to          identify the degree to which linguistic differences must be                     accommodated in the development of \"user-friendly\" GISs.  The study             will enhance understandings of the ways in which language helps                 structure individual understandings of spatial relationships, and it            will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to          continue to develop independent research skills.",
