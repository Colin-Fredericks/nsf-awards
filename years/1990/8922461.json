 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in metallurgy                    between Dr. Clive Clayton, State University of New York at Stony                Brook and Professor Ingemar Olefjord, Department of Engineering                 Metals, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden.  In              previous studies carried out by these investigators, it has been                observed that hte composition of the alloy surface layers                       interfacing the passive film is quite different from the bulk                   composition.  The aim of the proposed collaboration is to                       investigate what contribution, if any, the surface modified allow               plays in passivity.  They propose to conduct electrochemical and                surface analytical studies on thin alloy films fabricated to                    simulate the interfacial layers observed on a series of stainless               steels.  This study will also evaluate the potential of this                    approach to the design of new highly corrosion resistant alloys                 and protective coatings.                                                                                                                                        Dr. Clayton and Professor Oleford are two of the foremost surface               analysts working on the complex topic of passivity research and                 have made major contributions in this field.  In addition, Sweden,              because of its stainless steel manufacturing tradition, is                      particularly strong in new stainless steel research.  The results               of this research may lead to an improved fundamental understanding              of the processes that cause passive behavior in                                 alloys.",
