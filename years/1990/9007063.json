This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Michael                     Becker of the University of Washington to work with Prof. Dr.                   Robert Huber of the Max-Planck-Institut f\u001ar Biochemie in                        Martinsried bei M\u001anchen, Germany, on \"X-Ray Crystallography                     Studies of Phycobiliproteins.\"  Phycobiliproteins of the                        cryptomonad algae have highly unusual spectral and morpho-                      logical characteristics.  The principal investigator proposes                   to determine the structure of one of these proteins by X-Ray                    diffraction techniques.  In order to find a phycobiliprotein                    suitable for X-Ray diffraction studies, the investigators                       will first isolate, partially characterize, and attempt to                      crystallize phycobiliproteins from several different species                    of the cryptomonad algae.  Structural studies on these                          proteins could yield exciting information in at least two                       different areas of biochemistry:  photosynthetic energy                         transfer, and protein folding and aggregation.",
