 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop new strategies for                       determining the structures of macromolecular assemblies not                     amenable to conventional crystallographic analyses.  The                        focus will be on assemblies made up of many identical                           subunits arranged into helical or planar arrays.  Most of the                   subunits making up these assemblies cannot be made to form                      three dimensional crystals nor can the assemblies themselves                    be crystallized.  Diffraction from the non-crystalline                          specimens that they do form has intrinsic limitations that                      make extraction of structural information more difficult than                   for crystallographic studies.  In this project Dr. Makowski                     will develop methods to exploit new sources of phase                            information, methods for integrating structural information                     from other experimental techniques, and continue development                    of fundamental techniques needed for successful use of fiber                    diffraction.  Specific objectives include; (1) use of                           multiwavelength anomalous scattering for phasing fiber                          diffraction patterns; (2) development of a method for                           refining structural models directly against film data; (3)                      use of simulated annealing for refinement of structural                         models against fiber diffraction data; (4) development of                       methods for integrating other structural information as                         restraints into the refinement of a structural model; (5)                       development of quantitative methods for assessment of                           structural models; (6) exploration of new methods of specimen                   preparation.  These methods will be tested on a variety of                      macromolecular assemblies.  The objective of the work is an                     integrated set of methods applicable to a very broad range of                   macromolecular assemblies.",
