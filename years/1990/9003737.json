 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed study of the enzymes, deoxycytidylate (dCMP) (dCD) and               thymidylate (dTMP) synthase (TS), will be conducted in order to                 further understand how the structures of these two enzymes                      determine their catalytic specificities.  Both enzymes are                      important in providing pyrimidine nucleotide precursors of DNA                  and are notably elevated in mitotically active tissues and cells.               The availability of large quantities of T4 dCMP deaminase will                  make possible detailed studies on locating the substrate binding                sites as well as the allosteric sites for dCTP and dTTP.  Site-                 specific and random mutagenesis studies are planned to modify                   amino acids at the above binding sites to determine their                       influence on enzyme activity.  dCMP deaminase is present in very                low amounts in eucaryotic cells, but has been isolated and                      purified to homogeneity by using a modified substrate affinity                  column.  Our ultimate goal is to use recombinant DNA methods to                 synthesize large amounts of the human dCMP deaminase in bacteria                or yeast for further mechanistic and binding sites studies                      similar to those described in this proposal for T4 dCMP                         deaminase.  Attempts will be made to crystallize T4-dCMP                        deaminase, as has been described by us for T2-dCMP deaminase, for               x-ray structural studies in collaboration with colleagues at the                Medical Foundation of Buffalo, Inc.  Studies of T4-thymidylate                  synthase will center around the additional proteins                             expressed by the complete gene, which is composed of two exons                  separated by an intron.  The significance of the Td gene encoded                IRF protein, which possesses a specific endonuclease activity, will             be studied with respect to its properties, its solubilization,                  processing and potential transposase activity.  In addition the                 high level expression of the exon I and exon II genes of Td will                be attempted.  Continued emphasis will be placed on x-ray                       crystallographic comparisons of TS from different sources, of                   particular interest will be the structure of the phi3T phage TS.",
