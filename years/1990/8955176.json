 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rutgers University will conduct a three-year program to develop a               leadership cadre of secondary school teachers in selected topics in             discrete mathematics and their applications.  The project includes a            four-week summer workshop for each participant, two weeks of which are          on content and two on methodology.  After implementation, follow-up, and        sharing with colleagues, lead teachers will be selected for the next            workshops and for outreach.  The proposal is based on a successful pilot        project, and participants will be selected from a large region, within          200 miles of Rutgers University, to increase the outreach.  This program        is a direct result of the designation of the Center for Discrete                Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science (DIMACS) as a Science and          Technology Center by the National Science Foundation.  It will be               conducted by the Rutgers University Center for Mathematics, Science and         Computer Education (CMSCE). Rutgers University has contributed an amount        equal to 31% of the National Science Foundation request.",
