 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of promising new resonant structures and modern                 microwave technology to EPR studies of problems in materials                    science, chemistry, physics, biology, and medicine, is limited by               the lack of engineering design data.                                                                                                                            The PI's propose to test the quantitative predictions of our                    theoretical results for inductive coupling, parallel capacitive                 coupling, and series capacitive coupling.  Sensitivity of                       coupling to dimensional and electrical parameters will be                       explored.  The best designs will be implemented for CW and pulsed               S-band and X- band spectrometers.  Primary focus will be on ease                of sample change, returning, and variable temperature operation                 for samples contained in standard cylindrical tubes and in                      solvents of various dielectric constants.                                                                                                                       A variety of equipment will be built:                                                                                                                           A hybrid microwave EPR bridge that will be more sensitive and                   cost-effective than present bridges.                                                                                                                            An electronically tunable LGR for S-band operation that will                    improve tunability of the resonator/matching network. A system in               which the preamplifier is cooled along with the resonator to take               advantage of the low noise possible at cryogenic temperature.                                                                                                   Design guidance that will come from the proposed work is urgently               needed by many research groups.  The results will enhance the                   competitiveness of American spectroscopic measurements.",
