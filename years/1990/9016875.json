The focus of                    the investigation is on the tolerable amount of lateral drift                   that existing infills can resist within their plane before                      significant damage occurs.  In addition, the stability of                       damaged infills is to be examined by loading cracked panels                     normal to their plane.  Repair measures will be developed that                  will enhance transverse flexural strength.                                                                                                                      A series of full-scale specimens are to be constructed and                      tested.  Each test structure will be a one-story masonry                        infill panel surrounded by a one-bay reinforced concrete                        frame.  Horizontal forces will be applied at static rates, but                  will be cycled in a representative sequence of small and large                  amplitudes.  Variables of the test series will include the                      type of masonry unit (clay brick or concrete block), the type                   of mortar, the strength and stiffness of the frame and the                      type of infill repair method.                                                                                                                                   This project is part of a collaborative research effort which                   combines fundamental studies by an academic institution and                     a professional engineering firm.  Together they represent a                     common effort for the implementation of research results.",
