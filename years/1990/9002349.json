 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction diffusion equations may give rise to a variety                    of pattern like solutions.  These include traveling wave                        solutions, stable steady solutions, cellular patterns,                          oscillatory solutions, and even solutions which behave in a                     chaotic manner.  All of the systems which the principle                         investigator will consider arise as a mathematical model of a                   biological or chemical system.  This project will consider                      models for combusion, chemical reactions on catalytic surfaces,                 phase transitions, and bursting in excitable membranes.  The                    primary goals of this research project are to investigate through               which mathematical mechanisms these patterns may arise, analyse                 the stability properties of each pattern, and understand what                   physical significance each pattern has for the underlying                       physical problem.                                                                    The problems to be addressed in this project raise a number                of fundamental mathematical issues.  Of particular interest are                 patterns arising in more than one space dimension.  Much of the                 analysis will be concerned with how higher dimensional patterns                 bifurcate from basically one dimensional objects such as planar                 wave solutions and radially symmetric solutions.  Simple                        examples demonstrate that the structure of the bifurcating                      patterns may be incredibly complex.",
