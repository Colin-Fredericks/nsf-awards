 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) produce a yellow                     pigment in the sheaths or capsules surrounding their cells when                 exposed to high intensity sunlight.  The goal of this project is                to determine the chemical nature of this pigment, and to assess                 its effectiveness in protecting these organisms from the harmful                effects of short wave solar radiation, in particular, ultra-                    violet radiation.  The experiments will use laboratory cultures                 and will determine the various effects of normal and enhanced                   levels of ultra-violet radiation on photosynthesis, growth , and                survival, with and without the protective pigment.                                   This research is particularly relevant because stratospheric               ozone depletion may result in significantly greater levels of                   ultra-violet radiation.  It is important to understand all the                  \"strategies\" employed by living organisms to protect against this               potentially damaging radiation.  Shielding by sheath pigments in                cyanobacteria may represent one of the earliest and most                        primitive adaptations to excess light and short-wave radiation.",
