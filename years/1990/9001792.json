 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides additional support for research                        by a Presidential Young Investigator working on problems of                     Fourier analysis related to the microlocal analysis of                          partial differential operators and the theory of Fourier                        integral operators.                                                                  Work will be done in developing a microlocal version                       of the maximal theorem of Bourgain.  The result concerns                        the maximal operator associated with the Radon transform (over                  spheres) which was shown to preserve the Lebesgue spaces for                    powers greater than two.  The averaging may be viewed as a                      Fourier integral operator of negative order one-half.  Efforts                  will be made to determine if the same result holds for any family               of nondegererate operators of the same order, depending smoothly                on a linear parameter.  Some additional conditions have to be                   established since a total generalization is known to be                         impossible.                                                                          A related type of operator studied by Carleson and Sjolin is               known to preserve the fourth-power Lebesgue spaces.  In this                    project, work will be done in expanding the operators to integral               transforms involving exponential of the Laplace-Beltrami                        operator.  If this is possible then the Carleson-Sjolin theorem                 for Bochner-Riesz summation in the plane can be extended to                     compact manifolds.                                                                   Other work involves the question of embedded eigenvalues for               Schrodinger operators.  If the potential is bounded by the                      reciprocal of the variable, then Hormander showed that                          eigenfunctions which are small at infinity actually vanish                      everywhere.  The next step in analyzing this phenomenon is to                   determine exact conditions on the potential to guarantee the same               result.  An immediate goal will be to find the correct function                 space (one of the local Lebesgue spaces) for embedding the                      potential.",
