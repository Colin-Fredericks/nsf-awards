 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes a microcomputer based teaching facility for            non computer science majors who need to know how to use the computer as         a problem solving tool.  The facility consists of thirty workstations           connected to the instructor's console by a device that will enable him          to see and interact with each student's computer from the console.              Also connected to the console is a projection system to facilitate              group instruction.  The system will allow the instructor to take over           any workstation, interact with it, and project it onto the screen for           class discussion.                                                                                                                                               This facility greatly enhances the lecture/recitation instruction               format and the teaching of high level computer skills to non-majors in          an effective way.  Personalized \"hands-on\" instruction is provided to           many students simultaneously.                                                                                                                                   The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
