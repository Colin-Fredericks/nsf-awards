 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports the collaboration of                       Dr. Dilhan Kalyon of Stevens Institute of Technology (SIT)                      and Dr. Erdal Bayramli of Middle East Technical University                      (METU) in Turkey.  The proposed research will be carried out                    at both SIT and METU.  Dr. Bayramli will prepare coatings at                    METU and Dr. Kalyon will perform surface and rheological                        characterization experiments at SIT.  Project funding will                      allow Dr. Bayramli to spend two months per year at SIT and                      Dr. Kalyon will visit METU for a similar period of time.                                                                                                        Scope:  This proposal will bring together research                              scientists from two countries working in the area of wall                       slippage of polymer melts.  It is anticipated that this                         collaborative research will result in a better understanding                    of the processability of polymeric resins during various                        processing flows.  Dr. Bayramli will have an opportunity to                     become familiar with research techniques at SIT and,                            likewise, Dr. Kalyon will benefit from the time he spends at                    METU.  Therefore, this proposal fulfils objectives of the                       Science in Developing Countries Program in its exchange and                     transfer of scientific knowledge through an international                       collaboration.",
