 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia College Chicago has a significant tradition of training                future communications professionals, including a substantial                    proportion of women and minority students.  The Science and                     Mathematics Department incorporates this tradition into the                     chemistry curriculum by offering courses which examine the impact               of chemistry on areas of social concern like the environment,                   drugs and drug testing, and consumer product quality                                                                                                            Results of student research projects in these and other areas are               integrated with the students' communications specialties through                the presentation of reports such as videotapes, films, artwork                  and other creative presentations.  Student projects have appeared               on local cable television, and have been presented nationally and               internationally at numerous science museums, science centers,                   conferences, symposia and special lectures.                                                                                                                     Laboratory experience, which is a strong emphasis throughout the                curriculum, features numerous applications of analytical                        technique, including gas chromatography.  The acquisition of the                high pressure liquid chromatograph through this project expanded                the analytical methods component of the institution's laboratory                program as a logical extension of their chromatography                          capability.  The Atomic Absorption Spectrometer permitted                       analysis of metals in a variety of settings.  The instrumentation               allowed students to investigate and report on a wide variety of                 realistic problems in the application of chemistry to the                       concerns and needs of society.                                                                                                                                  The institution contributed to the project in an amount equal to                the NSF funds.",
