 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed study is to use molecular                    criteria to identify obligate or synergistic associations among                 members of a natural anaerobic microbial biofilm community under                changing environmental conditions.  To achieve this objective,                  comparative sequencing of environmentally derived 16s ribosomal                 RNAs and application of phylogenetically-based hybridization                    probes will be used to identify and monitor the dominant members                of groundwater biofilm communities that are established within                  laboratory bioreactor systems.  In conjunction with in situ                     hybridization techniques, this molecular framework will be used                 to define interdependent relationships among community members                  such as those involving H2-producing bacteria (fermentative and                 fatty acid-and alcohol-oxidizing bacteria) and H2-consuming                     bacteria (methanogenic bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria).                 Bioreactor operating conditions (eg. Substrate concentration and                sulfate concentration) will be altered to detect these                          interdependent associations by following coordinate fluctuations                among selected microbial populations (using the molecular                       approach described above) during biofilm colonization,                          development and establishment of the climax community.  The                     proposed research should provide fundamental information                        regarding the diversity, stability and function of natural                      microbial communities.  Such basic information about microbial                  communities has thusfar been inaccessible, but constitutes the                  foundation for studies of microbial ecosystem perturbation and                  assessment of the risk associated with the release of                           genetically engineered microorganisms into the environment.",
