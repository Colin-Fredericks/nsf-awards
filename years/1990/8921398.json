 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to support an International Conference on the                  Foundations and Applications of Utility, Risk and Decision Theory.              The conference will provide a forum for economists, psychologists,              philosophers, decision theorists, and others to share research                  ideas.  The quality of participants who have already agreed to                  attend is very high.  Moreover, the conference will include                     attendees from both North American and Europe, and will provide                 specific opportunities for young investigators to be involved.                                                                                                  The conference will contribute to advancing fundamental research                on economic utility theory, risk analysis, and behavioral decision              theory.  It will encourage cross-disciplinary interaction and                   cross-fertilization between diverse approaches.  Abridged versions              of conference papers will be published in a proceedings volume,                 with selected papers to be published in special issues of two                   leading journals.  In all, the conference will have considerable                impact on future research and applications of utility, risk, and                decision theory.",
