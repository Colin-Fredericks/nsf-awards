 "awd_abstract_narration": "This five site project is designed to accomplish the following six              objectives:                                                                                                                                                     1)  Conduct a mathematical/psychological/instructional analysis of the              content domain of multiplicative structures.  This analysis will                identify relationships within and between the many topics included              in this domain, and will form the framework for the curriculum                  development, assessment, teacher education, and research components             of the project.                                                                                                                                             2)  Develop an objectives framework and a scope and sequence for                    elementary and middle school mathematics curriculum material for                the domain of multiplicative structures:  to consist of multiplica-             tive concepts, relationships, operations, and problem situations                and will include:  multiplication, division, rational number                    concepts including fraction (part whole), ratio, decimal, operator,             measurement and proportionality up to and including missing value               numerical comparisons situations, qualitative reasoning and the                 graphical depiction and interpretation of linear functions.                                                                                                 3)  Outline a complete assessment program to coincide with project                  goals.  This assessment program will include a computer adaptive                learner profile test and computer based simulations of clinical                 interviews.                                                                                                                                                 4)  Develop, pilot, and implement abbreviated teaching experiments                  designed to explore students' \"logical conceptual development.\"                 Several of these mini units will also be field tested in 6-10                   intact classrooms.  Teachers will be interviewed.                                                                                                           5)  Refine, redevelop and extend, rational number related materials                 from our previous work so as to reflect more recent project                     understandings.  Materials will be formatted so as to be usable                 by middle school classroom teachers.                                                                                                                        6)  Develop and validate a model of rational belief change, which will              used for both helping teachers acquire knowledge about multi-                   plicative structures, and for evaluating teachers' knowledge about              this domain.",
