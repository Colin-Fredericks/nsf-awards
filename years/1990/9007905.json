 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue to                develop numerical methods based upon iterative techniques for the               approximate solution of a class of nonlinear elliptic eigenvalue                problems that arises in physics and engineering.  What sets this                class of problems apart and makes it interesting is the                         requirement that the solutions to be approximated must satisfy an               additional integral constraint.  Most numerical schemes in                      current use approximate solutions of elliptic equations that                    satisfy conditions on the boundary of the domain, while in this                 grant the principal investigator has to modify existing schemes                 or invent new ones in order to assure satisfaction of the                       integral constraint.  Such eigenvalue problems arise in the                     theory of nonlinear waves and there is a genuine need for                       reliable numerical methods to generate accurate approximate                     solutions.                                                                           In many mathematical models of physical phenomena the                      process under consideration is realized as the solution of a                    differential equation that satisfies certain additional                         conditions.  For example, one may know the state of the process                 at some initial time or along the boundary of the domain.  In                   these cases there exist reliable numerical methods that provide                 accurate approximate solutions with the aid of a computer.  In                  this grant the principal investigator will study processes that                 satisfy an integral constraint, instead of the more familiar                    initial or boundary conditions alluded to above, and so she will                have to develop new numerical methods to find the solution.",
