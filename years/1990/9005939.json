This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support four research                       projects in  the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the                University of New Mexico.  The names of the investigators and the               titles of their projects follow:  Edward Bedrick, Outlier Tests                 for Logistic Regression, A Conditional Approach;  Ronald                        Christensen, Influence Diagnostics in Linear Models for Spatial                 Data;  Wolfgang Bein and Pramod Pathak, Integration of Surveys;                 and William Zimmer, An Essentially Non-parametric Bayes Empirical               Bayes Procedure.",
