 "awd_abstract_narration": "A field program will use Seabeam and SEAMARC II                            simultaneously for investigating the section of the East Pacific                Rise along the Pacific-Antarctic plate boundary. A principal                    objective is to determine how the characteristic structure of                   normal and oblique fracture zones are created at offsets of the                 rise-crest. The northern part of the Pacific-Antarctic plate                    boundary is well suited for such a study, because it is the best                modern, active analog to the Tertiary Pacific-Kula and                          Pacific-Farallon spreading centers, where the well known North                  Pacific fracture zones were created. Sparse magnetic data from                  the rise flanks and the obliquity of the overall trend of the                   ridge crest to the spreading-normal direction suggest that it has               small, migrating nontransform offsets, as well as a set of                      typical transform faults. Another aim of the proposed cruise is                 to establish the style of plan and profile segmentation of this                 poorly known accreting boundary.",
