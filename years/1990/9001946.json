 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Vermont will connect their campus network to                  the New England Academic and Research Network (NEARnet), a                      regional network which is part of the NSFNET.  Direct connection                to NEARnet will provide researchers with improved access to the                 Internet and other national networks such as CSNET/Bitnet and                   USENET.  The proposed 1.5 million bit per second, dedicated,                    communication link will improve reliability, speed, turn-around,                and flexibility for data communication functions such as file                   transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing.  NEARnet will                     provide for equipment, maintenance, and information services.                                                                                                   The University of Vermont will be able to integrate                             supercomputing and collaborative research into graduate and                     udergraduate curricula.  In addition the State Library Services                 and Middlebury College will be connected to the main campus and                 provided connectivity to the rest of the Internet through                       already existing local networks.  This project thus provides                    sharing of resources among the state institutions, greatly                      facilitates research by students and faculty, and provides a                    valuable resource to supplement course work.***",
