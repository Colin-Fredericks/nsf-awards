 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Flora of North America Project is a collaborative                      endeavor among U.S. and Canadian museums and universities to                    produce an authoritative taxonomic inventory of all species of                  vascular plants growing without cultivation in North America                    north of Mexico.  This would include all the ferns, gymnosperms                 (conifers and cycads), and flowering plants, estimated at 17,000                to 20,000 species.  Twelve printed volumes and a computerized                   database are to be prepared, to contain morphological                           descriptions, chromosome numbers, geographic range, vernacular                  names, and habitat and phenological notes (seasonality of                       flowering and fruiting), all arranged within a modern taxonomic                 system of classification.  The database will be maintained as an                ongoing resource and will provide easy access to the data for a                 wide range of users.  Phase two activity includes editorial work,               preparation and illustration of species-level treatments,                       workshops for authors, and management of the database.  Groups of               plants that will receive attention during the grant period                      include Cyperaceae (sedge family), Fabaceae (bean family), and                  Rosaceae (rose family).                                                              The Flora of North America project provides a synthesis of                 up-to-date taxonomic information on the plants of the North                     American continent north of Mexico.  Such information will be of                use to resource managers, conservationists, those exploring                     economic and medicinal uses of plants, and research biologists.                 The inventory will form the baseline data by which changes in                   local and global environmental conditions can be monitored, and                 it will furnish a summary of the plant diversity of this                        continental region.",
