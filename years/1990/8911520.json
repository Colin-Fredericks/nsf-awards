 "awd_abstract_narration": "Copepods of the genus Calanus and its near relatives are the                    most abundant zooplankters in mid-latitude oceans.  Their life                  cycles characteristically include prolonged resting phases in                   the last developmental stage, the fifth copepodite (C5).  These                 dormant periods are spent at considerable depths in mid-water.                  Feeding and developmental progress both stop, while activity is                 sharply limited. Rest phases in the life history are very                       common among animals, and for many groups, such as the insects,                 the biological details of the resting phases are very well                      known.  In Calanus this is not the case. An experimental                        analyses of the factors influencing the onset of dormancy and                   arousal will be initiated. Dormant C5 will be collected in                      dark-maintaining containers from waters off Maine in autumn,                    and will be exposed to three treatments: 1) constant darkness;                  2) near-surface intensity and daylength; and 3) 500 m intensity                 and daylength. Results should reveal whether the mechanism that                 triggers arousal is endogenous (an internal timer) or exogenous                 (a response to photoperiod).",
