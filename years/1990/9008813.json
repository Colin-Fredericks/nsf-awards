 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve two basic topics of combinatorial                geometry, namely polyhedra and configurations.  The principal                   investigator will study a general theory for polyhedra in 3-                    dimensional space including self-intersecting polyhedra and those               with self-intersecting faces.  He will also analyze polyhedra                   without self-intersections which have faces which are equivalent                under symmetries of the polyhedron.                                                  Examples of convex polyhedra in three-dimensional space                    include boxes, pyramids, and the shapes of most buildings.  These               are convex if they have no indentations and always protrude                     outward.  When a convex building has windows, one cannot see the                outside of the building through any of these.  For many decades                 mathematicians have studied convex polyhedra and their many                     applications.  The principal investigator will extend many of the               results of this earlier work to polyhedra which are not convex.",
