 "awd_abstract_narration": "Incubation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens with host cells results                 in synthesis by the bacteria of cellulose fibrils.  These fibrils               serve to anchor the bacteria firmly to the host cell surface.                   Using transposon mutants which are unable to synthesize                         cellulose, the genes required for cellulose synthesis are being                 identified and characterized.  The subcellular localization of                  these gene products and the steps involved in cellulose synthesis               are being determined and the regulation of bacterial cellulose                  synthesis by the presence of host cells examined.  Although there               is some information available on the mechanism of cellulose                     synthesis, there is little knowledge of the genes and gene                      products involved in its synthesis in any organism.  In addition,               cellulose synthesis in A. tumefaciens is an interesting example                 of the regulation of the synthesis of an exopolysaccharide                      involved in bacterial adhesion by the presence of the host cells                to which the bacteria bind.                                                                                                                                     Cellulose is the most abundant polymer in the cell walls of                     higher plants and is of enormous importance globally.  Other                    organisms (besides higher plants) are also capable of                           synthesizing cellulose and are more amendable to biochemical and                molecular manipulation.  The plant pathogen, Agrobacterium                      tumefaciens, synthesizes cellulose which appears to play an                     important role in its interaction with its host.  There is very                 little information available about the mechanism of cellulose                   synthesis in any system and almost nothing is known of the genes                involved or their regulation.  A. tumefaciens provides a good                   system in which to examine the mechanisms and genes required for                cellulose synthesis not only in this organism, but higher plants                as well.",
