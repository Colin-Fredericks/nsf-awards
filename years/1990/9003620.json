The study has two broad goals.  First, using                                    a variety of methodological approaches, to                                      determine the impacts (both real and                                            perceived) of the earthquake on low income,                                     homeless and non-English speaking people.                                       Second, the study will examine the                                              organizational responses of public agencies                                     (relief and social service agencies, city                                       departments, etc.) whose task it is to serve                                    these clients.                                                                                                                                                  Data will be collected using random sampling                                    and snowball sampling techniques and will                                       consist of semi-structured interviews with                                      effected persons and with staff of public                                       agencies whose task it is to serve these                                        individuals.",
