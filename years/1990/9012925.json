 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the early development of the biotechnology industry, new                     contexts of biotechnology firms were created, joining the                       university lab, while at the same time old contexts of                          pharmaceutical and chemical firms were largely pushed aside.                    Understanding these changes is important to explaining where the                industry may go in the future, as well as in understanding growth               of other science-based industrial developments.  Zucker and                     Brewer propose to study and explain the rate of founding and the                geographic location of new biotechnology firms as a function of                 available intellectual capital and the dual membership of                       founders in firms and universities, as well as the phenomenon of                new biotechnology firms spinoffs and the extent to which                        scientific knowledge remains public or becomes proprietary.  They               also propose to model the productivity of scientists as a                       function of a variety of individual and contextual factors.  They               will combine a number of different data bases to obtain                         information and make use of innovative modeling techniques that                 combine partial likelihood and multi-level analytical methods.                  To estimate these models, detailed micro-level data must be                     collected, as well as data on the organizations and cities and                  regions within which the individual-level scientific discovery                  and application takes place.  Implications of this research                     include improved understanding of the discovery/application                     process, the effects of institutional context on that process,                  and the changing character of knowledge flow that follows from                  commercialization and the increase in proprietary pressures.",
