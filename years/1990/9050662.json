 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds were requested for a flame/furnace atomic absorption                      spectrometer and microwave sample digestion system to be used by                both Florida Institute of Technology and Brevard Community College.             It was located in a new Center for Chemical Instrumentation, a                  modern 4000 square foot laboratory complex jointly managed by FIT               and BCC.  At FIT it was used by undergraduates in several courses               offered in the Chemistry Department.  At BCC it was used by                     students in an innovative new Instrument Technician program.                    Because instrument based analytical chemistry is critical to the                nation's high technology industries, the demand for skilled                     analytical chemists and instrument technicians is expected to                   remain high for many years.  The equipment of this proposal was                 used to help educate and train those chemists and technicians.",
