 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the processes by which human activity has most dramatically         altered natural environmental conditions across the globe in recent             decades has been the destruction of large tracts of tropical                    rainforest.  Millions of acres have been cleared in the Amazon basin of         South America.  Considerable scholarly attention has focused on the             biological, atmospheric, and hydrological ramifications of accelerated          deforestation, but relatively little research has been conducted to             identify and understand the attitudes that residents of the Amazon have         toward the rainforests and the processes by which they clear land               individually and as members of groups.  This project will consist of a          pilot study to refine survey instruments and will provide preliminary           results to facilitate refinement of hypotheses for a larger study of            the attitudes and actions of rainforest residents rainforest in the             Sucumbios province of northeastern Ecuador.  Surveys will be tested in          interviews with members of roughly 400 households.  These tests will            determine the most effective means of gathering descriptive information         about the demographic and economic characteristics and the land- and            resource-use practices of settlers; they also will refine methods for           effectively eliciting information about household attitudes regarding           current status and future aspirations, the availability of resources,           and the institutional and societal factors affecting individual                 activities.  In addition to refining data gathering capabilities,               results from the trial surveys will be used to improve a model that             relates social and ecological processes.  The project will be conducted         in coordination with the Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo, an agency of           the Ecuador government.                                                              This project will significantly improve our knowledge of the               efficacy of specific surveying and interviewing approaches in settings          like northeastern Ecuador.  More importantly, it will provide a means           for gathering valuable information about the characteristics of                 settlers who are clearing large tracts of tropical rainforest and the           perceptions and attitudes that lead them to act in that way.  The               broader significance of this research therefore will be felt both with          respect to our general understandings of how people value and use               natural resourcesand also in our improved knowledge about of the ways           in which social and economic processes contribute to dramatic changes           in the natural environment.",
