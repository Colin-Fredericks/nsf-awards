 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide Nautical and Naval Science               students with a 30 student Multipurpose Microcomputer teaching                  laboratory.  By utilizing new technologies and software, several new            courses are being developed.  A unique feature of this laboratory is            the utilization of microcomputer based hardware and software to teach           principals of safety in marine navigation.                                                                                                                      The equipment purchased for this project includes 80286 8MHZ machines           with one 3.5 inch floppy drive and one 20MB Hard Drive, 640K RAM/256            EMS.  These machines permit the utilization of software for Nautical            and Naval Science.                                                                                                                                              An RCS-100 authoring system is an important component of this project           and consists of a graphics panel assembly, sonic digitizer, stylus,             microphone assembly, and connecting cable.  The use of the sonic                digitizer as the students interface with the training media allows the          instructor to present visual support of teaching points as a panel of           photos, drawings or forms, or as graphics on a video monitor.  This             allows the instructor to direct the students attention to higher                fidelity graphics and objects within an are that is much larger and             more versatile than any video - only system.                                                                                                                    The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
