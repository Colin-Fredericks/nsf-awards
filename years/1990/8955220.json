 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Iowa will conduct a thirty-month program to develop a         cadre of lead teachers in discrete mathematics, transformational and            vector geometry, and the use of technology in teaching mathematics.  In         all, sixty well prepared secondary mathematics teachers will participate        in a series of summer workshop and follow-up activities designed to             provide the necessary subject matter content and leadership training and        to winnow out the final group of lead teachers.  These leaders will             return for a two-week workshops on leadership and additional work on            implementing the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics Standards.         This project builds on a successful Teacher Enhancement program                 conducted previously by senior staff members.  The project includes a           strong component on learning issues especially relevant to under-               represented groups in mathematics.  The University of Iowa, Maharishi           International University, and the participants' schools are contributing        an amount equal to 25% of the National Science Foundation request.",
