 "awd_abstract_narration": "To exercise leadership, engineering educators need to provide                   their students with the tools to identify and respond                           appropriately to engineering problems with ethical dimensions.                  This pilot study will test an approach for introducing ethical                  decision problems into required undergraduate engineering courses.              The study has a dual purpose:  to develop and test a case study                 approach to sensitizing engineering students to the ethical                     issues involved in their engineering decision making, and to                    provide them with conceptual tools for thinking about these                     problems in a clear and responsible manner.  These goals will be                achieved by collecting and cataloging relevant case studies                     which include both technical and ethical issues.  These cases will              provide the basis for the development of aproximately 10 modules                that will be integrated into the syllabi of selected required                   engineering courses.  The case will transcend traditional                       departmental disciplinary lines and will cover such topics as                   environmental impact, product quality, safety and structural                    design.  They will be tested om selected classes in the Civil,                  Chemical, and Mechanical Engineering departments.  The study will               also develop a resources book of annotated and catalogued case                  studies complete with classroom use guidance material.  The use                 of the material in classroom sessions, some of which will be                    recorded on videotape, will be evaluated by students and faculty,               and by a carefully selected national advisory committee.  Results               will be widely reported at professional society meetings,                       particularly the annual meeting of the American Society of                      Engineering Education.                                                                                                                                          This proposal focuses on an important area in Ethic and Values                  Studies.  The team of investigators is very well qualified;                     the plan is thoughtful and feasible; university support is                      extremely good.  Results are likely to improve the teaching of                  engineering ethics on this campus and in undergraduate curricula                nationwide.  Based on the merits of the proposal and the                        generally positive review, support is highly recommended.",
