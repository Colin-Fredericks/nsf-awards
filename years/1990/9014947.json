 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Research will support                     mathematical research on general mathematical structures for fast               Fourier transforms algorithms.  The focus will be on computing                  the discrete Fourier transform for the general case.                            Applications to data possessing crystallographic symmetries will                be made.  Studies on related fast convolution algorithms will                   also be made.                                                                        Data transformation and permutation algorithms will be                     produced. These be necessary for transforming data between stages               of the Fourier transforms and for reducing and expanding data for               input and output.                                                                    Algorithms will be adapted to machine architectures                        including those of vector, parallel and hierarchical memory                     machines.  They will take account of data flow, data permutations               and data access in large scale computations.                                         Group theoretical methods will play an important part in                   this effort.  Included in the work is the goal of a systematic                  classification of the symmetries of all crystallographic groups.                     Algorithms and programs for others parts of the                            crystallographic calculation, particularly the refinement                       problem, will be produced.                                                           Implementation of this work in one large general                           crystallographic program package and report on the efficiency is                planned.",
