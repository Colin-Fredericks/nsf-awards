 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution was able to purchase a gas                chromatograph/mass spectrometer.  A central theme is the                        improvement of students' understanding of reaction mechanisms and               stereochemistry.  In the first semester Organic Chemistry, GC/MS                helped to introduce the concept of carbocation stability.  In the               second semester, GC/MS was used to analyze the stereochemistry of               addition reactions that form threo- or erythro-bromo-                           deuteriobutane and the subsequent base-promoted elimination                     reactions of these stereoisomers.  Such difficult concepts are                  seldom addressed in conventional organic laboratory due to the                  lack of proper instrumentation.  In Physical Chemistry the GC/MS                is being used to determine kinetic isotope effects and                          stereochemistry for gas-phase syn-elimination of the previously                 prepared deuterated bromobutanes.  The Instrumental Chemistry                   course is emphasizing technique, operation of the instrument, its               capabilities and interpretation of spectra.  In Environmental                   Chemistry GC/MS is helping demonstrate detection and                            quantification of organic contaminants in ground water.  Many                   students find the GC/MS vital to their undergraduate research                   projects.  Through more sophisticated experiments the GC/MS is                  improving instruction in Organic, Physical, Instrumental, and                   Environmental Chemistry courses.                                                                                                                                The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
