 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural Networks and Expert Systems have                                         each shown important successes in                                               diagnostic domains ranging from process                                         control to vehicle power trains.  Neural                                        networks are particularly effective at                                          lowering knowledge engineering costs by                                         automatically learning patterns from                                            training data, while expert systems are                                         more effective at representing knowledge                                        gained from experts, at providing                                               explanations of its diagnoses, and at                                           performing sequential actions such as test                                      sequencing, repair, and repair validation.                                      The proposed work investigates a hybrid                                         system where neural networks perform an                                         initial diagnosis via acoustic signal                                           recognition, and an expert system performs                                      follow-up tests leading to a specific                                           diagnosis and repair strategy.                                                                                                                                  The Phase I prototype showed that a                                             standard low-cost platform could support a                                      hybrid of neural network, expert system,                                        and data acquisition software, that the                                         hybrid system has a smooth user interface,                                      and that the neural network can                                                 successfully classify acoustic signal data.                                     The Phase I survey showed considerable                                          interest from potential users in industry                                       and the military.  The Phase II study will                                      address critical research issues:                                               comparison of various neural network                                            paradigms for effective signal                                                  classification, comparison of neural                                            networks with traditional signal                                                classification techniques, and effective                                        techniques for explaining the hybrid                                            systems's reasoning to the developer and                                        end user.                                                                                                                                                       The hybrid system has potential                                                 applications in situations where signal                                         data and symbolic data must be used                                             together for a definitive and repair                                            procedure.  Potential applications include                                      factory floor, military, aerospace, nuclear                                     power plant, commercial vehicles, and                                           materials certification.",
