 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to obtain temperature sensitive                    yeast mutants in which mRNA exit from the nucleus is blocked at                 the restrictive temperature.  After mutagenesis of selected yeast               strains, mutants will be selected through a series of screening                 procedures designed to eliminate those which are simply                         temperature sensitive for protein synthesis or amino acid uptake,               and to identify those which continue to synthesize mRNA but do                  not allow it to exit the nucleus at the non-permissive                          temperature.                                                                                                                                                    Although transport of molecules into and out of the cell nucleus                is critical for the life of a cell, the mechanisms regulating                   such transport are not understood.  Furthermore, despite the                    central importance of messenger-RNA exit for all eukaryotic                     cells, a genetic approach to this fundamental problem of cell                   function has not previously been taken.  Success in obtaining                   temperature sensitive messenger-RNA exit mutants would therefore                provide important new tools that would permit analysis of the                   molecular basis of this process.",
