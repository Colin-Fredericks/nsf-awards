 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will concentrate on the analysis of the low             resolution spectra obtained with IRAS in order to establish the                 characteristic dust grain signatures found in the 8-22 micron region.           With these spectra, Dr. Little-Marenin will be able to investigate and          possibly extend the chronology of dust formation and microwave maser            development in relatively older and optically thick circumstellar               shells associated with M stars.  The time variability of the emission           from the circumstellar shells will be investigated by analyzing the             IRAS broad band fluxes and the spectra of individual IRAS                       observations.  Analysis of the emission and absorption features                 observed in the circumstellar shells associated with C stars should             provide observational evidence for the carbon-bearing dust grain                formation sequence that has been proposed.                                        In addition, Dr. Little-Marenin will teach an Introductory Astronomy          course, develop a research seminar on the late stages of stellar                evolution and organize a lecture series given by women astronomers.             She will also give departmental colloquia, seminars and informal                presentations.                                                                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
