 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort represents the fifth in a series of NSF-                    supported quinquennial surveys of undergraduate programs in                     mathematics and computer science departments at the Nation's                    colleges and universities. This project provides much-needed and                unique information on undergraduate courses, enrollments,                       faculty, teaching formats and organizational structure in                       mathematical and computer science departments in U.S.                           universities, 4-year colleges and two-year colleges. These data                 have not been collected by any other agency at any other time.                          This proposal also calls for the establishment of a                     comprehensive and more permanent data base of all undergraduate                 departments of mathematical and computer sciences in the United                 States. A relatively recent initiative for NSF, the lead agency                 for U.S. science and engineering education, is its undertaking of               the development of a national data base on science and                          engineering undergraduate education. This survey, conducted by                  the Mathematical Association of America, is an important piece of               that initiative, and can serve as a prototype study for NSF in                  its development of data for other science and engineering                       disciplines.",
