 "awd_abstract_narration": "The taxonomic classification of the southern hemisphere                    plant family Proteaceae, distributed in Australia, South Africa,                and South America, is based largely upon morphological features                 of the flowers and fruits.  About 67 genera and 1450 species are                currently recognized.  To test the classification of these plants               with new data, Dr. Sylvia Feuer of DePaul University is                         investigating the pollen structure and sculpturing of                           representative samples using light- and electron-microscopy.                    Fine details of the pollen wall surface and wall layering are                   being analyzed with cryosections and with transmission electron                 microscopy, to obtain information useful in determining                         equivalent features for comparison among pollen from different                  genera.  Patterns of pollen wall structure and sculpture are                    expected to be similar among closely related groups of taxa, and                to exhibit recognizable trends of evolutionary change.                               Differences among pollen grains of this family that are                    being described by Dr. Feuer will also allow determination of the               correct taxonomic association of dispersed fossil pollens.                      Grains thought to be from Proteaceae occur in deposits in the                   northern hemisphere, far outside the current geographic range of                the family.  Accurate determination of their taxonomic status is                prerequisite to resolution of the historical biogeography of                    these plants and to further analysis of climatic and other                      controls on plant distribution.",
