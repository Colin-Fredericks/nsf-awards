 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis Program.                 Dr. Lipshutz will continue his very productive studies of                       organometallic reagents based upon complexes of copper.  These                  have the potential for producing highly selective synthetic                     tools that can be used in the synthesis of the reactive                         molecules that are found in nature.                                                                                                                             This research describes, in part, a number of new synthetic                     methods which take advantage of the efficiency and mildness of                  higher order cuprate-based transmetalation processes of                         organotin compounds.  Tolerance to a variety of functional                      groups within the stannane precursor itself will be studied,                    looking to form highly functionalized cuprates.  Allylic                        reagents are to be examined with respect to substitutions at                    both tetrahedral and trigonal centers.  Moreover, cyclic                        allylic stannanes are considered, as is the chemistry of allyl                  cuprates in the presence of carbon monoxide en route to direct                  1,4-acylations of alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones.                                                                                                               As part of a program in polyene construction, new lynchpins                     will be developed which will take advantage of site-selective                   transmetalations made possible by differences in relative rates                 between vinylstannanes.  Applications to synthetic problems in                  the leukotriene and pheromone areas will be pointed out.  The                   possibility of using oxidative \"decomposition\" of higher order                  cuprates, in a synthetic sense, to effect biaryl couplings will                 also be studied.                                                                                                                                                The last portion of the research involves spectroscopic                         investigations of several species.  One concerns the nature of                  the new reagent derived from CuI/LiCl/Bu3SnH, believed to be                    (X)HCuLi.  Another will be an in-depth study of Yamamoto's                      reagent.",
