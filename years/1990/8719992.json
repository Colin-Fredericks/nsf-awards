 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests partial support for expansion of the                     millimeter wave interferometer at Owens Valley Radio Observatory                to an array of six telescopes with fifteen simultaneous baselines.              The instrument is currently operating in the 1.3 and 2.6 mm bands               with three 10.4 m high accuracy telescopes equipped with low noise              SIS receivers.  The interferometer has been used very successfully              for high resolution aperture synthesis mapping of the molecules in              planetary atmospheres, in the circumstellar envelopes of evolved                stars, in local star forming regions, and in nearby galaxies.                                                                                                   The major element of this project is the construction of three                  additional telescopes, each equipped with dual frequency front end              receivers.  The digital spectroscopic correlator will be expanded               to handle 15 simultaneous baselines with up to 500 MHz bandwidth.                                                                                               The proposed expansion will result in an order of magnitude                     increase in speed for the array and similar increase in the dynamic             range of the data through implementation of self calibration                    procedures.  The system will be extremely versatile with the                    capability for mapping both primary millimeter bands, dual                      polarization measurements and full imaging capability on all                    angular scales greater than 1\".  The highest resolution will be                 similar to that of the best optical imaging obtained with ground-               based telescopes.                                                                                                                                               It is proposed that the three new telescopes be funded with                     equivalent contributions by Caltech, the NSF, and the University                of Toronto.  The budget submitted here is for NSF support of one                of the three new telescopes with its associated electronics.  The               instrument will be run as an open facility with extensive use by                researchers outside Caltech.",
