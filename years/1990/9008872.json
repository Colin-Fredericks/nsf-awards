 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells and glial cells are the major cell types present                    within the nervous system.  Glia cells surround nerve cells and                 constitutes more than half the mass of the nervous system.  The                 traditional view was that glial cells were just space fillers                   between nerve cells, however, with the advent of new                            technologies, it has been determined that glia plays a crucial                  role in many neuronal processes such as neurogenesis, neural                    regeneration and neural function.  Glia have been shown to                      interact with nerve cells in complex ways that are essential for                the health of the nervous system.  A conferences under the                      auspices of the New York Academy of Sciences has been planned to                bring together investigators studying in vivo and in vitro                      preparations involving vertebrate and invertebrate systems.  The                intent of this meeting is to discuss the recent advances in the                 cell biology and physiology of glial cells and to examine the                   most promising lines of future development.",
