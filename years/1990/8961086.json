 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of hybrid neural network architectures                          can have advantages over stochastic time series analysis                        techniques and other regression techniques in forecasting.                      These nonlinear systems can exhibit the ability to                              represent nonlinear mapping networks, to manage                                 multivariate data, to manage temporal relationships, and                        to function without the prior selection of a basis function.                                                                                                    This Phase I program will identify and characterize                             potential hybrid neural network architectures which                             provide significant performance advantages over presently                       used techniques in forecasting large scale nonlinear                            systems.  In addition, this program will compare the                            performance of currently used time series techniques with                       the performance of specialized neural network                                   architectures.                                                                                                                                                  This project has strong commercial applications.                                Nonlinear forecasting systems are particularly well suited                      for electric power forecasting, econometric modelling,                          and transportation forecasting.  With the addition of a                         powerful user interface to the optimized nonlinear                              systems of Phase II, the final system is expected to be                         very useful to the above mentioned industries.                                  Therefore, follow-on funding is fully expected.",
