 "awd_abstract_narration": "Conodonts have been utilized, especially during the last 50                years, as principal biologic indices of geologic age.                           Paleoecologic interpretations of observed distributions have been               attributed largely to life habits of conodont animals, and only                 general mention has been made of the potential for post-mortem                  disruption of death assemblages.  The effects of post-mortem                    transport processes on distributions of conodont elements in                    shallow-marine carbonate environments will be investigated by                   means of laboratory settling and flume experiments.  Because of                 the highly variable sizes and shapes of these phosphatic grains,                significant differences exist in terminal settling velocity in a                static fluid and are suggested for (1) critical conditions (mean                flow velocity) for initiation of movement, (2) transport within                 migrating small bedforms, (3) differential sorting of elements                  along a transport path, and (4) amount of breakage during fluid                 transport.  These hydrodynamic differences are extremely                        important because they would have strongly influenced the                       distribution of discrete conodont elements, particularly in                     moderate to high energy regimes.  Quantification of these factors               can then be used to constrain the paleoecologic interpretation of               preserved assemblages of conodonts in peritidal carbonate rocks.                This will permit a quantitative approach to determining the                     amount of post-mortem transport experienced by conodont elements                prior to their burial and will also allow for direct statistical                comparison of the composition of different samples, when                        taphonomic effects are factored.  Quantification of post-mortem                 transport broadly enhances the interpretation of biostratigraphic               and paleoenvironmental data of conodonts, with implications for                 the study of other skeletal allochems, by providing models for                  the interpretation of physical environmental processes that                     played a major role in the formation of fossiliferous deposits.",
