 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oregon State University will operate the R/V WECOMA during 1990                 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded                      research projects.  The R/V WECOMA is a 177' general                            research vessel constructed in 1975 and owned by the National                   Science Foundation.  OSU operates the WECOMA under a charter                    agreement with NSF.  The ship operates primarily in the North                   Pacific.                                                                                                                                                        This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.",
