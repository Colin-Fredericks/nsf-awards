 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale ranching and logging operations are converting                 mature, forested ecosystems of Amazona to frequently-burned,                    regrowth forest.  In a mature forest relict at the heart of an                  Amazonian ranching and lumbering center, root systems extend to                 at least 12 m depth and apparently enable this ecosystem to                     maintain carbon assimilation and transpiration through the 5                    month dry season.                                                                    The project will evaluate the hypothesis that frequently-                  burned, regrowth forests (1) are shallow-rooted, (2) extract less               water from the soil during the dry season and (3) store less                    rainfall in the soil during the wet season in comparison to the                 mature forests that they are replacing.  These prediction are                   tested by a comparative study of root distribution, fine root                   growth, soil water availability, soil water uptake and rainfall                 storage in mature forest, intact regrowth forest, and recently-                 burned regrowth forest.  This will be accomplished using a                      network of soil shafts, 7 m deep, in which measurements of root                 distribution and monitoring spatial and temporal patterns of root               growth, soil water potential and soil water content will be                     observed.  The studies proposed here will ask basic questions                   about an important, but previously neglected aspect of ecosystem                structure and function within the context of a rapidly changing                 tropical landscape.  The investigator are well qualified for this               type of research and have more than adequate institutional                      support.",
