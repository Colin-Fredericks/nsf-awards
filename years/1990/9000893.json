 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gradute student Morefield under the guidance of Dr. Loren                  Rieseberg of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the                several species of an American Southwest sunflower relative,                    Stylocline, and its relatives, in order to assess levels of                     genetic and genomic variability within and among populations of                 these annual and highly inbreeding plants.  Primary methods of                  analysis include protein electrophoresis to sample variation in                 soluble enzymes extracted from the plants, along with methods of                DNA analysis to measure mutational differences in nuclear                       ribosomal genes and in chloroplast genes.  Several related groups               of plants also will be studied, in order to construct a                         phylogenetic framework indicating evolutionary relationships                    among the species.                                                                   Much of the theoretical discussion about speciation                        processes relies upon knowledge acquired from organisms that                    cross-breed, but many groups of plants include high proportions                 of self-fertilizing individuals.  It is unclear whether these                   inbreeding groups follow the same evolutionary rules, and whether               they harbor similar amounts of genetic variability within local                 populations.  With additional data from studies of morphological                features, the student will also be able to determine reliable                   features for species identification, map geographic distributions               for all the taxa, and evaluate the correct scientific names for                 all those groups with distinguishable characteristics.  The                     student will thus gain valuable training in a broad range of                    modern systematic methods in the analysis of plant diversity.",
