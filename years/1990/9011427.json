 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potassium channels are important for encoding electrical messages               in the nervous system.  The goal of this research project is to                 identify genetic mutations, alterations in the genetic code, that               affect potassium currents in the fruit fly Drosophila.  More than               forty mutations have been identified on the basis of behavioral                 defects which enrich for mutations that disrupt the functioning                 of ion channels.  These mutations will serve as the resource                    material for the project.  Membrane currents recorded from the                  mutants will be compared with those from normal currents for                    physiological properties.  Mutations that exhibit alterations in                one or more of the four known potassium currents in Drosophila                  will be characterized genetically and studied to determine the                  specific potassium current affected and the nature of the effect.               Because of strong similarities between ion channels from                        different species, information on Drosophila potassium channels                 will aid in studying potassium channels in other organisms,                     including humans.  Analysis of potassium channels will help in                  the understanding of potassium channel function in several                      cellular processes including learning and memory, cardiac                       pacemaker activity, repetitive firing and mediation of                          therapeutic action drugs.",
