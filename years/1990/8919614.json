 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Watson will continue his theoretical research program related               to astrophysical environments in which the matter is diffuse.  The              emphasis will be on astrophysical topics in which an improved                   understanding of the microscopic processes and physical aspects of              radiative transfer is likely to play an important role.  Theory                 for astrophysical masers will be a central goal.  At the outset,                Dr. Watson will focus on various aspects of the transfer of                     polarized maser radiation that potentially are involved in a full               understanding of the recent detections of \"Zeeman patterns\" in the              spectra of water masers in star forming regions.  To do this, Dr.               Watson will build upon current developments in making the theory                considerably more realistic for polarized maser radiation.  Dr.                 Watson will also perform research related to understanding the                  power of astrophysical masers and the implications for the                      energetics and dynamics of star forming and circumstellar regions.                                                                                              Although outstanding astrophysical issues ordinarily are phrased                in global terms, such as star formation, dark matter in the                     Universe, and galaxy formation, the foundations for understanding               the phenomena and for interpreting the relevant observations                    frequently depend in a critical way upon the detailed treatment of              the physical processes.  Of particular relevance to Dr. Watson's                work is that much of our observational information in astronomy                 comes from studies of emission and absorption of spectral line                  radiation.  The observed intensity of such radiation from diffuse               astronomical environments can be particularly sensitive to the                  details of atomic, molecular, electronic, and radiative transfer                processes.  As astrophysical observations continue to be pursued                with improved refinement and sensitivity, as well as new                        environments and wavelengths, it is reasonable to expect that                   research which emphasizes the role of the above physical processes              will continue to play a significant part in the progress in many                areas with broad impact in astronomy and astrophysics.",
