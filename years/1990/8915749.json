This plan will be                  based on the major research questions and potential ice core                    sites identified in the report of the Workshop of U.S. Ice Core                 Research and the information gathered in the report on U.S. Ice                 Core Research Capabilities.  The ICWG will actively solicit the                 input and comments of key members of related disciplines, such as               paleoclimatology, climate modeling, oceanography, atmospheric                   sciences, etc, to identify research priorities and a suite of ice               core projects for the next decade.  The plan will formulate the                 contributions of the U.S. Ice Core research community to the                    study of Global Change (ICSU program).                                                                                                                          During 1990-91 the ICWG will work with NSF and its Polar Ice                    Coring Office (PICO) towards the realization of the research                    plan.  The requested budget covers the costs of ICWG meetings                   held to discuss, and further develop, the long-range research                   goals, as well as day-to-day administrative costs of the ICWG.",
