 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                   geometry of Professor Jeremy Teitelbaum of the University of                    Illinois at Chicago. Dr. Teitelbaum will pursue his studies of                  the geometry and arithmetic of the p-adic upper half plane,                     guided by the Exceptional Zero Conjecture, which relates the                    values of certain functions, namely p-adic L-functions, to the                  analytic geometry of certain curves. In addition, he will                       continue his study of the computational complexity of algorithms                from algebraic geometry.                                                             Arithmetic algebraic geometry is a subject that combines                   the techniques of algebraic geometry and number theory. In its                  original formulation, algebraic geometry treated figures that                   could be defined in the plane by the simplest equations, namely                 polynomials. Number theory started with the whole numbers and such              questions as divisibility of one whole number by another. These two             subjects, seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other            from the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual             influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic algebraic              geometry now uses techniques from all of modern mathematics, and is             having corresponding influence beyond its own borders.",
