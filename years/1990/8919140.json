 "awd_abstract_narration": "This \"accomplishment-based-renewal\" provides funds for Dr.                      McNutt to continue research on two closely related projects                     awarded her by MG&G; both pertain to the study of anomalous                     elevations of ocean crust beneath the Pacific.  The first of                    these features is the South Pacific Superswell, a large area of                 seafloor as much as 750m shallower than predicted by its age                    relative to the 125km-thick cooling plate model of Parsons and                  Sclater.  Previous analysis by Dr. McNutt discount both local                   density and dynamic stress field anomalies as the fundamental                   cause; a plate model thinned to 75 km and accompanied by small-                 scale convection in the underlying asthenosphere is favored.                    This renewal will allow her to complete the write-up phase of                   this analysis, and to evaluate the model by writing computer                    code that will model this convective flow and test its                          stability.  The Darwin Rise is a second depth anomaly studied                   under a previous award, and Dr. McNutt and colleagues argue it                  was formed by the same processes that created the Superwell.                    She will continue analysis of isostatic compensation                            surrounding Mesozoic guyots surveyed on a recent cruise across                  the Darwin Rise with the objective of gaining better                            understanding of mantle dynamics.",
