 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on electron                       systems and superconductivity in condensed matter physics to                    be held in Rio de Janeiro from July 9-13, 1990.  The U.S.                       organizer is Pedro Schlottmann of Temple University in                          Philadelphia.  His Brazilian counterpart organizer is                           Dr. Gaston Barberis of the University of Compinas in Sao Paulo                  which, along with the University of Sao Paulo, is a very                        strong center for solid state (now called condensed matter)                     physics.  The participants will be an international group of                    leading physicists, listed as an Organizing Committee (from                     the major universities in Brazil) and as an International                       Advisory Committee in the proposal.  In addition, this                          funding will support the attendance of at least eight young                     investigators to be chosen from those submitting abstracts.                     Two Latin American countries with strength in low-temperature                   physics which will send representatives are Argentina and                       Chile.                                                                                                                                                          The workshop is clearly in a critical area of physics, one in                   which both the U.S. and Latin America have strong research                      groups.  There has not been a conference in this field of                       valence fluctuations on the American continent since 1981 so                    it is certainly timely to hold one now.  Presentations of                       recent work in the U.S. as well as Brazil, Argentina and Chile                  will stimulate future developments and further collaborations                   between these scientists.  The topic is a major problem in                      condensed matter physics and is of currently intense interest                   in the U.S. and Latin America as well as the rest of the                        world physics community.",
