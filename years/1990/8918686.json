 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Shaffer will examine the process, as well as the                       pattern, of speciation and differentiation in the wide-ranging,                 extremely variable North American Tiger salamanders.  The project               has two fundamental objectives.  First, it uses a new series of                 techniques from molecular biology to collect DNA sequence data                  from salamander populations from across North America and Mexico.               The sequence data will be used to determine the phylogenetic                    relationships of the salamanders, using patterns of similarity                  and differences in DNA as an indicator of recency of common                     ancestry.  These results will complement previous research                      conducted by Dr. Shaffer on the phylogenetic relationships of                   tiger salamanders and will answer fundamental questions on how                  genetic diversification has occurred in this continentally                      distributed species.                                                                 Dr. Shaffer will also examine the mechanisms by which this                 genetic differentiation has evolved.  To do so, breeding                        experiments will be conducted that quantify the extent to which a               lack of interbreeding in the field is attributable to either 1)                 developmental abnormalities that occur after mating, or 2)                      behavioral differences between populations that make them less                  likely to court and mate with one another.  By interfacing this                 mechanistic approach with the molecular description of the                      evolutionary pattern of differentiation, the research will                      provide a unique, in-depth analysis of how speciation occurs in                 wide-ranging vertebrate species.",
