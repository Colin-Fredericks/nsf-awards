 "awd_abstract_narration": "Eleven museums in Massachusetts have formed a unique                            collaboration to help elementary school teachers improve their                  over all science literacy and their ability to transmit such                    literacy to the children that they teach.  The main focus is a                  three-week summer institute and school year follow-up program                   that has created a professional partnership between classroom                   teachers and the diverse resources of the museums, their                        staffs, collections and exhibits.  These partnerships                           contribute to the development of greater science literacy and                   improved attitudes toward science by these teachers and their                   students.                                                                                                                                                       One hundred and thirty two elementary teachers from at least                    thirty-five school districts in Massachusetts will be provided                  the opportunity to choose a workshop at one of the following                    facilities:  The Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, The                    Children's Museum, Boston, The Massachusetts Audubon Society,                   The MetroPark Zoos, The Museum of Comparative Zoology at                        Harvard, The Museum of Science, Boston, The New England                         Aquarium, The Manomet Bird Observatory, The Cape Cod Museum of                  Natural History, The New England Science Center and The                         Springfield Science Museum.  The whole group of teachers meet                   together for one day at the beginning and end of the workshop,                  but then attend the workshop of their choice, with their                        varying emphases on life science, physical science, and/or                      environmental science.  All programs are inquiry-based with a                   heavy emphasis on activities and discovery.                                                                                                                     Key summer activities focus on helping teachers understand the                  commonalities among diverse scientific fields.  The teachers                    develop an understanding of the nature of inquiry, the ways to                  foster it among children in school and out and investigate                      activities that can be modified for direct use in their                         classrooms.  Throughout the year, a variety of programs help                    the teachers with lesson planning, resource consultation                        through the various informal science facilities, the loan of                    materials and other support services.                                                                                                                           Networking activities are encouraged through the publication of                 \"Science is Elementary\", a rich newsletter that is distributed                  on a regular basis to participants of the program.                                                                                                              Thirty-five percent of the request has been cost-shared by the                  New England Aquarium, the collaborating museums, schools and                    private sector contributions.",
