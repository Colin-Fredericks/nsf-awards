 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project is concerned with the numerical solution of                several classes of linear and nonlinear integral equations.                     Specific types of integral equations slated for study include                   linear and nonlinear boundary integral equations, nonlinear                     Urysohn equations and nonlinear Fredholm equations.  Such                       equations arise in a host of pure and applied areas, and one of                 the goals of the research is the development of multi-purpose                   codes that can be fitted into software routines to enable                       researchers from many different disciplines to solve these                      integral equations efficiently and accurately.  Very often the                  solution of a problem in mathematical physics or mathematical                   biology can be expressed in the form of an integral equation.                   However this does not mean that the problem is solved; rather,                  the resulting integral equation must be solved either                           analytically or numerically.  In this proposal the researchers                  will improve existing numerical schemes and develop new ones in                 order to produce multi-purpose software for the approximate                     solution of several types of integral equations in several space                dimensions.",
