 "awd_abstract_narration": "The protein calmodulin is the principle transducer of messenger                 calcium.  It is believed to exist within the cytosols of all                    cells of all eukaryotes.  In its calcium forms, (but not in other               forms) it activates at least ten and probably as many as twenty                 different enzymes or structural proteins.  It has evolved by gene               duplication and is very highly conserved especially among the                   animals.  Previous crystal structure studies have revealed that                 calmodulin consists of two protein lobes joined by a short                      pepitde linking chain.  This proposal is to study two crystal                   structures of proteins related to calmodulin.  Crystals suitable                for x-ray diffraction studies have already been grown.  The                     significance of these determinations is their test of the model                 in which the central linker of calmodulin functions as a flexible               tether allowing specific patches on the two labels to enfold a                  target.",
