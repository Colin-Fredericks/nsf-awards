 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant family Araceae (the aroids) includes food plants                 (the taros), ornamentals, and ecologically important members of                 the wet tropical forests of the world such as philodendron,                     anthurium, and monstera.  Taxonomic relationships among the                     estimated 100 or so genera are poorly known, in part because                    morphological features occur in a complex mosaic-like fashion                   among these plants.  To acquire an independent dataset for                      establishing evolutionary relationships among the aroids, Dr.                   James French of Rutgers University is studying mutations in                     chloroplast DNA isolated from leaf tissues of representative                    species of nearly all known genera of the family.  Chloroplast                  DNA is a useful source of genomic data because its structure and                function are constrained overall; closely related plants differ                 by only a few mutations while more anciently diverged groups show               greater numbers of mutational differences.                                           By measuring the amounts and kinds of mutational differences               in chloroplast DNA among aroid genera, Dr. French is constructing               a phylogenetic tree for the family.  This diagram of taxonomic                  relationships will help improve the classification of these                     plants, organizing related genera into the same tribes and                      subfamilies.  With a phylogeny as guide, researchers can study                  the evolution of the complex morphology of aroids and the various               breeding systems known for members of the family.",
