 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order for undergraduate teaching faculty to be capable and                   comfortable in introducing courses in artificial intelligence (AT) and          expert systems into the curriculum, they must be well founded in content        and have personally experienced prototypical development processes in           AT.  In addition they need to know the associated learning strategies           and experiences of those who have taught and researched this area.                                                                                              This project is presenting an intensive, three week, Summer Institute           for 25 faculty consisting of content modules, hands-on laboratory               experiments, and teaching strategy sessions to present up-to-date               information on Symbolic and Logic Programming, Fundamentals of                  Artificial Intelligence, and Knowledge-Based and Expert Systems.                                                                                                The fundamental concepts of symbolic programming (as exemplified by the         use of Lisp) and of classical logic and logic programming (within the           practical limits of Prolog) are being presented first in both a                 theoretical and a practical laboratory setting.  The second week is             covering the fundamental paradigms of artificial intelligence                   (reasoning, goal reduction, constraint propagation, searching, control,         deduction, knowledge representation, and the elements of machine                learning, vision, robotics, natural language processing).  During the           third week the participants are learning knowledge engineering concepts         and practicing them, working with and gaining experience in programming,        analyzing, and using a number of KBS and ES shells in laboratories, and         designing a working rule-based system of their choice.                                                                                                          The highly modular nature of this summer institute is offering the              attending faculty a wide variety of individually tailored courses               adaptable to the precise needs and circumstances of their home                  institution curriculum environment.",
