 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent discovery of new high temperature superconductor                     systems has created a need to develop compatible measurement                    techniques to characterize the electrical, structural, acoustic                 and optical properties of these materials.  Although many                       standard methods of measuring conventional superconducting                      materials can be adapted to new high Tc superconductor systems,                 effective measurement of critical properties is difficult.                      Conventional acoustic techniques to measure the physical                        properties of superconducting materials normally require contact                between the sensor and the superconducting material under test.                 This research uses noncontacting laser-based ultrasonics as a                   means of accurate, non-intrusive measurement of the electronic,                 vibrational and optical properties of new high Tc                               superconducting materials.  Successful completion of this work                  would result in a research technique for improved material                      characterization in superconducting perovskite structures in                    environments at lower than room temperature.  The significance of               this program is the possible development of noncontact and                      versatile ultrasonic monitoring system for fabrication processes                and of acoustic vibrational mode measurements for                               superconducting device performance.",
