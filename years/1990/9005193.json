 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inorganic phosphate is an important part of cells as well as                    body components such as bone.  The amount of phosphate within an                organism can alter bodily calcium balance, acidity of body                      fluids, and growth.  Phosphate regulation is therefore important                in all vertebrates.  Dietary intake, intestinal absorption and                  renal excretion determine the body phosphate balance.  The                      processes in the kidneys which control the excretion of phosphate               are not understood in animals such as birds and fishes.  Unlike                 mammals, the latter have a mechanism to transfer phosphate                      directly from blood to the urine through kidney cells.  The                     objectives of this work include the study of the mechanism of                   phosphate transfer at both the cellular and cell membrane levels.               Regulation of phosphate excretion by the kidneys involves the                   interaction of hormones, acid-base balance, and dietary phosphate               availability.  Dr. Renfro will examine the basic cellular                       processes by which these factors alter body phosphate.",
