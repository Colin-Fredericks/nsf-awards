 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of eleven U.S. mathematicians             in a small international symposium to be held in Iceland in July,               1990.  The organizing committee, chaired by George McNulty of the               University of South Carolina, has representatives from several                  countries.  The local organizer is Professor Ragnar Sigurdsson,                 President of the Icelandic Mathematical Society.  The meeting is co-            sponsored by this Society as well as the University of Iceland and              several U.S. universities.  The purpose of the symposium is to                  provide an international forum for the exchange of ideas and results            at the leading edge of mathematical research in lattice theory,                 universal algebra and algebraic logic.  The occasion for the symposium          is the seventieth birthday of Bjarni Jonsson, who was born in Iceland           in 1920, though his academic training and career were pursued in the            United States.  His fundamental contributions in the above topics               have made him a leading figure for nearly forty years.  The present             day vitality of universal algebra and of lattice theory can be                  traced, in large part, to new research directions initiated by                  Professor Jonsson.                                                                                                                                              The areas addressed by the \"Jonsson Symposium\" are important mainstream         fields of mathematics that have grown enormously in the past forty              years; the main researchers in these fields are scattered around the            world.  Although these topics are addressed regularly at small                  national or regional mathematics meetings, this will be the first               conference to bring together a substantial number of specialists from           North America to meet their colleagues from Western and Central                 Europe.  The symposium offers a strong program and a convenient                 central location that should attract broad international participation          and provide a strong stimulus to cooperative research.  NSF funding             will be directed especially at the participation of young U.S.                  mathematicians.",
