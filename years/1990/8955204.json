 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Chemical Education (ICE) will continue its                    diverse program of chemical education for teachers at the                       elementary, middle school and high school levels.  This current                 two-year project describes the continual evolution of the ICE                   program, with some of the proven components continuing with non-                NSF funding and current ones reflecting both the maturing of                    relatively new programs and changes in the perceived needs of the               community of teachers.                                                                                                                                          Continuing programs are (1) the Instrumentation Program at                      University of Arizona (UA) which includes a strong Outreach                     (Equipment Loan) Program, and (2) the Fellows Program at                        University of Wisconsin-Madison (UWI-M) whose Fellows will be                   embarking upon the task of assembling, editing and publishing the               materials that have been produced as a result of the programs of                the last six years. The first program involves 30 highly                        selected, well-prepared teachers from across the nation who will                participate in a two-week long workshop preparing them to produce               some simple instruments based on the study and use of more                      complex instrumentation which will be available to them for their               own use. The loan program has been very successful in providing                 sophisticated equipment to schools which would ordinarily not                   have access to this level of instrumentation. The Fellows Program               will select three chemical educators for a period of one year to                begin and complete the massive task of making the accumulated                   materials, such as the ICE Guidebook for Chemical Activities,                   available for dissemination.                                                                                                                                    New programs are (1) Science Activities for Elementary Schools                  (SAES) at UWI-M, University of Northern Colorado (UNC), and Miami               University of Ohio (MU), an outgrowth of the Supplements Program                which will provide opportunities for 60 elementary and middle                   school teachers (20 at each site) to spend two weeks on hands-on                chemistry appropriate for those grade levels, (2) the Affiliates                Program to be held in conjunction with the SAES programs,                       selecting 10 college or university chemists who are charged with                replicating this program on their own campuses, and (3) Chemistry               Fundamentals for Prehigh School Teachers which will select 40                   prehigh school teachers in need of updating and enrichment in                   chemistry and chemical education methods of instruction and                     laboratory activities for an intensive four week workshop, to be                held at UNC in year one and UNC as well as UWI-M in year two.                                                                                                   This iteration of the ICE Programs will have teacher workshops at               sites across the country with participants having an opportunity                to select sites close to home.  These sites are UWI-M, UNC, MU,                 and UA.  Ongoing programs include the Fundamentals Program for                  High School Chemistry Teachers at University of California-                     Berkeley (UC-B) and Catholic University (CU), with an emphasis on               minority participation of teachers from the Western region and                  the Greater Washington, D.C./Baltimore area, the Instrumentation                Program at UC-B and the recently completed Laboratory Leadership                Program at UC-B.                                                                                                                                                The current project has cost-sharing from the Universities and                  school districts equivalent to 20% of the NSF request.",
