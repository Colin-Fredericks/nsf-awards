 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent attention focused on the accelerating pace of human-induced         environmental change obscures the fact that people have had profound            impacts on natural systems for millennia.  In the Western Hemisphere,           significant changes occurred in the wake of European settlement over            the last 500 years.  Within central Mexico, the introduction of Spanish         agricultural practices resulted in significant changes in the form and          intensity of land uses.  This doctoral dissertation project will                examine how such changes have been recorded in the sediments of the             upper Rio Laja valley.  Radiocarbon dating will be used to establish an         alluvial chronology of the upper Rio Laja valley; a hydrologic                  comparison of modern and pre-colonial rivers will be based on standard          paleohydrologic techniques; rates of soil erosion will be measured in           two tributary channels; and historic evidence of erosion in upland              regions will be evaluated.                                                           This project will provide valuable information about the historic          evolution of land-use patterns and related changes in river valley              deposits.  Although focusing on a specific locale in central Mexico,            the study will yield broader insights into the complex ways in which            human and natural systems have interacted over the last four centuries.         The project also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising          young scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
