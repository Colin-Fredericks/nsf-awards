 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves a cooperative effort among eleven                         institutions in the Maricopa County Community College District, in              cooperation with Arizona State University and 58 public school                  districts in Maricopa County.  The project consists of a set of                 coordinating activities, designed to increase significantly the                 representation of minorities, blacks, Hispanics, and Native                     Americans in science, engineering, and technology.                                                                                                              The minority enrollments (1988-89) were 73% Hispanic, 19% Black,                and 8% Native American.  A total of approximately $450,000 has been             committed for the first year in leveraged funds.  There are several             creative characteristics to the program, such as day care                       facilities, bilingual materials, and programs for parents.  Other               program activities include 22 summer camps, precollege motivational             and nurturing experiences, after school tutoring, hands-on                      laboratory work, and research minigrants.                                                                                                                       The needs have been well documented.  The management plan is                    strong.  The competence of staff and documented, relevant                       experience are outstanding.                                                                                                                                     The District, as a measure of its commitment and support, will                  assume, by the fifth year, the full salary of the project director.             In addition, an 8% indirect  cost rate is use to maximize the funds             available for the program.",
