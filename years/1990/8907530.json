 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the utilization of neural network concepts               in the design of control systems for complex dynamical systems.                 Neural networks can mimic certain human brain characteristics, a                potentially powerful feature for autonomous control systems.                    These characteristics include : (1) the ability to learn and make               decisions; (2) the ability to perform object and signature                      recognition under uncertain conditions and with incomplete                      information based on associative memory and generalization ; and                (3) a high processing speed due to inherent parallelism and                     distributed computation.  This research's goal is to study the                  feasibility of using neural networks as a basis for the                         development of true intelligent control and diagnostic systems                  with a high degree of robustness and the capability of real time                adaptivity, learning, and decision making.  The research focuses                on system identification and neural space representation, the                   objective being to develop a viable network concept which can                   learn the dynamic behavior of a physical system, and derive a                   neural space representation of the system.  The concept , when                  completed, will be implemented initially analytically on a set of               simple finite order systems, i.e., a second order spring mass                   damper system.  This will be followed by consideration of a robot               arm to study the feasibility of applying the neural space concept               to time varying systems, and then application to a flexible beam                to evaluate the potential of neural networks in identification of               flexible structures.  Finally, it is proposed to study                          identification of systems with nonlinear components.  The intent                is to follow up this project with efforts oriented to the                       development of robust and adaptive neurocontrollers, and neural                 based failure detection and identification schemes.",
