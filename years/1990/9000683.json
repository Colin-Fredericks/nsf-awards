 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to the Department of Natural Sciences             at South Carolina State College to establish a Research Experiences             for Undergraduates (REU) SITE.  The focus of the program will be                to expand the independent research capabilities of primarily                    minority undergraduate science majors, provide interactive                      opportunities for REU students with career research scientists, and             to stimulate and prepare students for successful graduate studies               and research careers.  Research projects will be unified around an              aquatic ecology theme, but students will have great flexibility in              choosing projects.  The locations of cooperating institutions; the              Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) adjacent to coastal                  estuarine systems not far from the Edisto River mouth and the                   Savannah River Ecology Laboratory (SREL) further inland near upper              coastal plain habitats will provide students with a comprehensive               picture of the kinds of research taking place along the length of               an entire river system.  Additional training benefits to students               will be derived from a series of ecological excursions guided by                off-site career researchers in cooperation with SREL and MRRI.                  This will not only help students improve their concepts of                      ecosystem interactions, but also provide for increased awareness                of career options and graduate studies through interactions with                host scientists.  A guest researcher seminar series will be held                at SCSC to introduce students to outside researchers and students               will present seminars of their findings.",
