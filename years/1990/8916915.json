 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of animal, plant and bacterial enzymes contain                         molybdenum.  In all cases it appears that the molybdenum is                     contained within a \"molybdenum cofactor,\" in a distinct                         structure which is essential for the enzyme's function.  The                    chemical structure of this cofactor has been highly conserved                   in different organisms.  From studies done on several species                   it is evident that groups of genes mediate the biosynthesis                     or acquisition of the molybdenum cofactor.  The failure of                      certain master genes to function in genetic mutants can                         result in the loss of all molybdenum enzyme activities, with                    drastic consequences for the organisms bearing this defect.                                                                                                     Dr. Finnerty's project focuses on an analysis of an important                   gene for an enzyme containing molybdenum in the fruit fly                       Drosophila.  Drosophila is an organism about which there is a                   great deal of genetic information available, and it therefore                   provides a highly favorable model system for investigation of                   the manner in which molybdenum is housed in enzymes that                        contain it. In addition to making use of genetic analyses,                      Dr. Finnerty is carrying out biochemical analyses to provide                    a comprehensive analysis of the structure and function of                       molybdenum cofactors in the Drosophila system.  Through                         investigation of this model system, information will be                         obtained that will be of benefit to the understanding of                        enzymes bearing the molybdenum cofactor in a variety of                         organisms.***//",
