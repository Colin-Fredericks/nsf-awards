 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric trace chemicals interact with cloud and surface                ice in complicated and ill-defined ways.  With the recognition                  that future efforts to model the atmosphere-earth system will                   rely increasingly on basic knowledge about such interactions, a                 series of laboratory experiments is to be carried out under this                research project.  The sorption and chemical reactivity of                      several trace gases (SO2, H2O2, O3, HNO3, HCl, CH4, and NO) on                  ice will be investigated with gas chromatography frontal analysis               over a broad range of temperatures (about -90oC to -20C).  The                  kinetic and thermodynamic data will elucidate the molecular-                    scale mechanisms of incorporation and reaction and help to                      identify the factors controlling the reactivity of atmospheric                  trace gases that come in contact with ice.  Other experimentation               will be performed with a recently developed continuous-flow cloud               chamber in order to measure the ability of ice growing in                       supercooled clouds to acquire particulate matter and retain                     volatile gases.  Simple cloud models will be used to ensure that                the findings of the laboratory experimentation are relevant to                  microphysical and chemical phenomena in atmospheric clouds.",
