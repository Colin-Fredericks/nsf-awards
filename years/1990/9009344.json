 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific goal of this project is the generation of the                      diasatereomeric 4-substituted phenacyl methylposphonate adducts                 of chymotrypsin and trypsin-like enzymes.  It includes the                      synthesis of the 4-nitrophenyl esters of respective inhibitors                  (PMNs), the study of phosphonylation by the their enantiomers,                  and, in particular of the self-stimulated dephosphonylation                     reactions.  Rational selection of the substituents in the 4-                    position of phenancyl will provide inhibitors that will                         regenerate enzyme activity on different time scales.  The                       potential for medical use of these compounds as modifiers of                    serine hydrolase activity through controllable                                  inactivation/regeneration cycles is suggested.                                                                                                                  Synthesis of the compounds and kinetic measurements will involve                conventional techniques.  Non-bonded interactions in the                        diastereomeric adducts will be evaluated by molecular graphics                  and mechanics calculations, in an independent, complementary                    research project. Results of all the investigations will then be                used to assess the use of phosphonate esters as active site                     probes of serine hydrolases.  Acetycholinesterase, for which no                 structural information is presently available, will be the target               of similar studies in the future.",
