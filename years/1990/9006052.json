 "awd_abstract_narration": "The structure of plant cell wall is not known in enough detail to               explain any of its biological roles in such processes as growth,                disease, resistance, and maintenance of cell shape.  Our lack of                structural knowledge is probably due to both the complexity of                  the structure and the paucity of researchers working on detailed                structural analysis of cell walls.                                                                                                                              Dr. Mort is proposing to continue analysis of the structure of                  the pectins of cotton suspension culture cell walls.  The goal                  over the next four years is to fully characterize the primary                   structure of these pectins.  He will characterize the                           rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI) region with respect to the structure                 of its sidechains, the distribution of acetylation in its                       backbone, and to what polymers RGI is attached.  He will                        determine the size of the homogalacturonan regions in cotton                    pectins, the distribution of rhamnosyl residues in them, the                    distribution of methyl esterification in them, and the type and                 distribution of sidechains directly attached to the galacturonic                acid residues (if they exist).  He will also determine the nature               of the linkage between the homogalacturonan region of pectin and                RGI.  When these details of the structure of cell wall pectins                  are known it will easier to study the complexities of the                       biosynthesis of pectins and the functional significance of the                  structural complexities of pectins, and to construct a more                     detailed model for the structure of dicot cell walls.  It will                  also be easier to understand the interaction of plant pathogens                 with cell walls.",
