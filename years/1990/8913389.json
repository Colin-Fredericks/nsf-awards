 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Dr. Richard Halliburton of Western Connecticut State University                 and Professor James S.F. Barker of the University of New                        England, New South Wales, Australia. The principle objectives                   are to survey Australian populations of Drosophila                              species for variation and differentiation of mitochondrial                      DNA, as detected by enzyme analysis, and to estimate correla-                   tions with genetic variability and with environmental                           variables.  Mitochondrial DNA has become an effective tool                      for inferring evolutionary relationships.  For one, because                     it does not undergo recombination, it alleviates problems                       associated with more conventional genetic analysis of                           evolutionary problems.  Project results will advance                            understanding of the extent and nature of genetic variation                     in desert Drosophila, the nature of interactions between                        mitochondrial and chromosomal DNA, and enable comparisons                       between Drosophila species in the United States and Australia.                                                                                                  The project represents excellent collaboration between the                      Australian researcher, world-known for his studies of the                       evolutionary genetics of Drosophila and Halliburton's                           expertise in enzyme studies that suggest that genetic                           variability is maintained by balancing natural selection, and                   not by migration or genetic drift. Validation of the                            Halliburton hypothesis would be strongly enhanced by testing                    over the wide geographical range offered by the Australian                      cooperation. Comparisons of desert Drosophila in the United                     States and Australia will advance basic understanding of the                    nature and causes of genetic variation in desert Drosophila.                    In addition, the research has potential to further under-                       standing of the evolution of desert organisms in general,                       with potentially important ecological implications.",
