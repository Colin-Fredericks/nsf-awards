 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research centering on                  topics in the theory of several complex variables.  The work                    involves studies of complex manifolds, representing the geometric               point of view, together with analytic investigations into value                 distributions and continuity properties of complex functions.                        One primary focus concerns what is known as the Hartogs                    phenomenon whereby a holomorphic function of several variables                  defined in a region surrounding a domain (such as in a complex                  annulus) continues as a holomorphic function to the inner region.               Work will be done in extending the idea in two directions.  The                 first is to determine the extent to which a separate analyticity                implies joint, while the second is concerned with the Hartogs                   phenomenon as it relates to mapping into complex manifolds.                     Although many manifolds reflect this property, some do not.  The                outstanding problem remains one of giving conditions on the                     target manifolds so that the extension property holds for all                   mappings into the manifold.                                                          Value distribution theory is concerned with the extent to                  which holomorphic functions defined in the space of several                     complex variables can omit or assume given values.  The                         measurement of such affinities involves generalizations of the                  classical Nevanlinna theory which was developed for functions of                a single variable during the first decades of this century.  For                nonconstant functions, their affinity for any value is almost                   always the same as for any other.  The exceptions represent the                 deficiencies of the function - the measure of the set of                        deficiencies will be of primary concern during this                             investigation.",
