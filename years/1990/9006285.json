The                      mathematical knowledge of the amount and pattern of genetic                     diversity under various  conditions is essential for the choice                 and design of experiments and for the investigation by computer                 of very complex systems.  Comparison of relatively simple models                with observations yields information about particular                           populations, and many such comparisons indicate the relative                    importance and conditions of action of the basic evolutionary                   forces.  The latter include natural selection, mutation,                        migration, and random fluctuations in the proportions of various                genes.  All of these will be studied in this project.  The                      evolution of repeated DNA sequences under gene conversion (the                  nonreciprocal transfer of information between genes) will also be               investigated.                                                                        In the long run, studies of genetic variability of the type                proposed here provide information that helps to preserve and                    manage wild animals and plants.  They also advance areas of the                 genetics of human populations that concern the frequency of                     genetic diseases, which are of immense medical importance.",
