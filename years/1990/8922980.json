 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interbedded glaciogenic and marine sediments exposed in                     many places along western Alaska comprise the best-known                        Arctic record of late-Cenozoic regional climatic change and                     eustatic sea-level fluctuations.  Western Alaska is one of                      few areas in Arctic North America where both terrestrial and                    oceanic records can be clearly resolved.  Based upon                            regional stratigraphic work completed over the last two                         years, it is now known that glaciation about 500,000 years                      ago throughout western Alaska was an order of magnitude more                    extensive than any subsequent glaciation.  This award                           supports an investigation of the well exposed stratigraphy                      sedimentology, and paleoecology of sediments representing                       this interglacial/glacial transition to better understand                       the regional climatic setting that culminated in the last                       extensive early to middle Pleistocence glacial events in                        northwestern North America.  Marine micro and macrofossils                      and terrestrial pollen, beetles, and plant macrofossils                         collected from nearshore prodeltaic deposits will be                            examined to reconstruct land-sea climatic conditions during                     this transitional period.  Data collected from this project                     will provide proxy data for understanding regional                              paleoclimatic conditions with implications for evaluating                       paleosnowlines, climatic gradients through the Bering                           Strait, and changing paleogeography at a time of climatic                       transition.",
