 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns two problems involving the averaging                 of partial differential equations with important applications go                Physics.  The first one consists of studying the response                       tensor, i.e. the tensor of effective properties of a composite                  material in which different processes are coupled, such as                      thermoelectric or thermoelastic media.  The second is to study                  the long time, large-scale asymptotics of diffusion-advection                   equations in which the velocity is a random, incompressible                     field, with a continuum of excited space and time scales.  This                 equation is known to exhibit interesting crossover phenomena,                   which are not well understood in the multidimensional case.                          The principal investigator hopes to develop new mathematical               insight to such problems, based on the theory of homogenization.                In particular, the advection-diffusion problem involves                         understanding renormalization of equations with random                          coefficient outside the regime in which mean-field theory is                    valid.",
