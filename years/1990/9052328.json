 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is widely used as a practical               tool in engineering and applied science, even though it is                      generally absent from university curricula and textbooks.                       Vigorous development by manufacturers has produced systems which                are no more expensive than other types of engineering geophysical               equipment.  The graphical cross sections produced by GPR will                   make it suitable for use by non.engineers or at a very early                    stage of instruction.  The equipment is also used in a highly                   quantitative mode by transferring the data to graphic                           workstations.  Our curricula lack hands.on experience with this                 modern tool, and we propose to correct deficiency by acquiring                  GPR instrumentation and incorporating it into four departmental                 curricula:                                                                                                                                                      1.
