 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research objective of this project is to produce a data set         which describes the contemporary situation of party activism and                organization in the eleven southern states.  Though this has not been           undertaken previously for any region of the United States, the                  objective is particulary important in a region undergoing significant           political transition, a region in which grassroots party organizational         changes are likely to impact national party politics.                                                                                                           More importantly, the project offers the possibility for analysis of            the role of political parties as one of the political organizations in          linkage politics.  In assessing the role of parties in linkage at the           grassroots, and in party systems on a statewide basis, the project's            findings will give insight into the role of parties in linkage and              their relationships to other linkage institutions such as campaign              organizations, interest groups, and the like.                                                                                                                   Research analysts from each of the eleven states will undertake                 comparable research activities.  Utilizing common instruments, the              researchers will collect several types of data for each state,                  including:  (1) individual data from mail surveys of samples of                 Democratic and Republican party precinct committee members; (2)                 individual data from the entire universe of Democratic and Republican           party county chairs; (3) aggregate data for the counties and states;            and, (4) historical data about Democratic and Republican party                  organization and party activists at other party levels.                                                                                                         The investigation should encourage replication because of its                   sufficiently broad data baseline and should have a catalytic effect on          systematic field research about political parties.  The data base               created will be made available to other scholars interested in the area         through the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social                Research at the University of Michigan.",
