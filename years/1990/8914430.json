 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. Samuel Jones at                  the University of Georgia, Mr. Myong Chung will study the                       morphology, chromosome composition, and patterns of genetic                     variability in Korean and Japanese species of the monocot genus                 Hosta, source of the horticulturally important hosta lilies.                    Numerous populations in Korea and Japan have been collected by                  the student over the past few years, and samples from these and                 other collections will provide materials for herbarium and                      laboratory studies.  Genetic barriers between species will be                   evaluated through a program of artificial hybridizations in a                   common-garden experiment, in part to test whether species are                   reproductively isolated.  Electrophoretic techniques are being                  used to measure amounts of gene differences between species,                    focusing upon a subset of seven species in a genus estimated to                 have 20 or so species in nature.  The hosta lilies, native to                   eastern Asia, are in a taxonomically confused condition, and the                project will help establish a reliable basis for species                        identification and for inferring evolutionary relationships among               the various forms.",
