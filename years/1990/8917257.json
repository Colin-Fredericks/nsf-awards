 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prior research led to the hypothesis that the Atlantic menhaden,                \u001aBrevoortia tyrannus\u001a, spawns during storms in water upwelled near              the western wall of the Gulf Stream.  This hypothesis is based on               inference from the sizes and birth dates of surviving larvae.  A                rigorous test of this hypothesis, and investigation of its                      adpative significance, requires studies of recently spawned eggs                and the resultant larvae.  Methods must be developed to                         facilitate such studies.  In particular, the ability of an                      optical particle counter to distinguish and count eggs needs to                 be evaluated.  The optical counter may also distinguish yolk sac                larvae of the Atlantic menhaden in natural assemblages of the                   zooplankton.  Tests will be done in the larboratory, with live                  eggs and larvae of the Atlantic menhaden from a captive spawning                stock, and at sea during a seven day cruise, deploying the                      optical counter with a CTD on a towed body.  The ability of a                   radio tracked, surface drifter to follow a patch of Atlantic                    menhaden eggs and larvae will also be tested.  A small group of                 scientists with expertise in meteorology, physical, chemical and                biological oceanogaphy, and theory will meet to plan a rigorous                 investigation of weather effects on the spawning and egg and                    larval ecology of the Atlantic menhaden.  The work will provide                 results valuable for the Atlantic menhaden and also other                       organisms with pelagic eggs and/or larvae.  Such organisms                      typically exhibit large variation in recruitment.                               %%%",
