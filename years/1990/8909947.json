 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical processes involved in the generation,                         maintenance, and dissipation of marine stratocumulus will be                    studies using observations and theoretical models.  These                       processes will be represented (or parameterized) in the current                 version of the NCAR community Climate Model (CCM) to provide                    improved simulations of low-level cloudiness and the associated                 surface fluxes of moisture and energy for both solid and                        partially cloud conditions.                                                          The thermodynamic and dynamic models that will be used to                  develop this parameterization will be tested and developed by                   using data collected from aircraft and satellite observations                   made off the coast of southern California from June 29 to July                  19, 1987 during the field phase of the First International                      Satellite Cloud Climatology Regional Experiment (FIRE) and by a                 regional application of the parameterization. These studies will                make use of mean, turbulence,cloud microphysics, and radiation                  measurements obtained from NCAR Electra and the UK C-130, cloud                 observations from satellites, and synoptic-scale analyses from                  the ECMWF.                                                                           The focus of the proposed process studies will be on                       entrainment and mixing at cloud top,convective circulations in                  marine stratocumulus, and factors that control the spatial and                  temporal variations in the cloud structure.  The theoretical                    work will involve the use of a radiatively-forced 18-coefficient                moist spectral model that include horizontally varying cloud-                   based and cloud-top heights an dan above-cloud inversion layer.                 The theoretical results from this model will be compared with the               structure obtained from the FIRE measurements and will provide                  the dynamical basis for the circulation velocities that are                     parameterized in the boundary layer model that will be embedded                 in the CCM.                                                                          This research is important because it intends to increase                  understanding of how clouds influence climate.",
