 "awd_abstract_narration": "The contractile ring is the array of microfilaments located                     beneath the plasma membrane of the cleavage furrow of dividing                  cells and represents the intracellular machinery responsible for                cytokinesis.  Because it is composed of cytoskeletal proteins it                has been characterized superficiallly as a muscle-like organelle.               The contractile ring has defied detailed experimental or                        compositional analysis because it is too small, transient, and                  labile for conventional isolation.  This joint research project                 will exploit a promising new method of preparing contractile                    rings in large numbers that will allow the first detailed                       analysis of the macromolecular composition and organization of                  this important cytoskeletal structure and its association with                  the plasma membrane.  The cell fraction enriched in contractile                 rings will be prepared from synchronously dividing sea urchin                   eggs.  In one set of studies, the morphological organization of                 the actin-myosin-membrane complex of the contractile ring will be               explored by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy, utilizing               available antiactin and antimyosin antibodies already known to be               effective.  In another set of studies, new monoclonal and                       polyclonal antibodies will be generated in order to discover and                identify as yet unknown regulatory and stabilizing molecules,                   using combined microscopic and immunochemical techniques.  A                    final set of experiments is designed to ascertain the extent of                 myosin phosphorylation in the contractile ring and to evaluate                  its role in myosin organization.                                                                                                                                The results of this collaborative research should elucidate the                 macromolecular machinery responsible for the separation of two                  daughter cells during cell division.",
