 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Howard Bigelow and Margaret Barr were mycologists                     (fungal specialists) on the faculty at the University of                        Massachusetts prior to their retirement.  During their long                     careers, they amassed the country's most comprehensive collection               of fungi from the northeast U.S.  The University has decided to                 discontinue its mycology program, and has offered this important                collection to the New York Botanical Garden.  NYBG has absorbed                 several regional collections of cryptogams in the recent past,                  and is emerging as one of the world's premier repositories of                   fungal specimens.                                                                    The proposed transfer of the University of Massachusetts                   mycology collections to the New York Botanical Garden will                      provide improved access to an important research resource.  NYBG                will integrate the new collection and will publish a catalog of                 the type specimens it contains, increasing the utilization of the               collection for biodiversity research.",
