 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to determine the                    influence of molecular constitution and crystallization                         conditions on the independent structural variables that describe                the crystalline state of long-chain molecules.  These variables                 govern the thermodynamic, mechanical, and other macroscopic                     properties of such systems.  It is planed to build upon the                     established base with respect to control of properties by                       molecular weight and the requirements for co-crystallization of                 linear polyethylene fractions and its copolymers to study the                   properties of well-defined binary and ternary mixtures of these                 species.  In addition to thermodynamic and tensile properties,                  the crystallization kinetics and morphological changes of these                 mixtures will also be studied.  Another portion of this proposal                deals with measuring and analyzing tensile properties of                        molecular weight and compositional fractions of homopolymers and                random copolymers.  Emphasis will be given to defining the                      boundary between ductile deformation and brittle failure in terms               of molecular and structural factors.  In these studies advantage                will be taken of a new apparatus that has been built and which                  only requires very small amounts of sample.  Detailed studies of                the fusion process, crystallization kinetics from the melt and                  crystallite structure will be made with high-molecular-weight n-                alkanes that are in the range C144H290toC408H818.",
