 "awd_abstract_narration": "Substantial sources of hydrogen sulfide exist with, for                         example natural gas, and as a product of petroleum refining -                   a product of the desulfurization process.  Hydrogen sulfide is                  a poison and a corrosive agent.  Converting it                                  electrochemically to pure sulfur could produce a desirable                      product as well as energy.                                                                                                                                      This project involves the study of the electrochemistry of                      hydrogen sulfide oxidation at different electrodes in a high                    temperature fuel cell.  The process is designed to overcome                     the corrosive nature of hydrogen sulfide by using a solid -                     oxide fuel cell and the insulating nature of elemental sulfur                   by operating at high enough temperatures.  Solid oxide fuel                     cells can be used for chemical synthesis as well as power                       production where the anode is used for selective partial                        oxidation of gaseous reactants.  A series of oxidation                          catalysts will be tried:  platinum applied by chemical vapor                    deposition or sputtering, perovskite-structure ceramics                         applied as a thin paste and thiospinels.  Of special interest                   is whether the oxidation can be halted at water and elemental                   sulfur, or whether it proceeds to sulfur dioxide.  Operating                    conditions, as well as electrode material, will be varied to                    elicit such control.",
