 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important processes in the evolution of                    flowering plants is doubling of the chromosomes, or polyploidy.                 At least 50% of all plants and nearly all of the major crop                     plants of the world are polyploid derivatives from diploid, wild                stocks.  Knowledge of how the process of polyploidization works                 is poor, as is understanding of the consequences with respect to                the organization and function of genes along the chromosomes.                        Dr. Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State University is examining                  the problem of polyploidy using the cultivated cotton plant and                 its wild relatives as a model system.  Using modern molecular                   methods, detailed genetic maps will be constructed of the                       chromosomes of both polyploid and diploid species.  The primary                 experiments involve isolating several hundred pieces of DNA by                  restriction-site digests and ascertaining their relative                        locations on individual chromosomes.  Then, comparisons of gene                 arrangements among species will reveal the extent to which                      particular pieces of DNA have changed position on chromosomes and               whether the DNA has undergone increase or decrease in copy                      number.  Such changes in DNA have been hypothesized to have                     regulatory effects on the form and function of the organism.  Dr.               Wendel's research will lay the basis for a genetic explanation of               morphological differences among plant species.",
