 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rabbit immunoglobulin allotypes are presumed to be inherited via                codominant allelic segregation.  However, latent or non-allelic                 gene activation has been documented for the Ig heavy (H) chain                  and kappa-1 light (L) chain loci.  This laboratory has recently,                for the first time, verified the existence of latent kappa-1                    light chain mRNA.  Latent b5 kappa-1 mRNA was induced in two b4,4               homozygous rabbits following infection with Trypanosoma brucei.                 In addition, latent b6 cDNA sequences have recently been cloned                 from an heterozygous b4, b9 rabbit.  Employing the polymerase                   chain reaction and molecular cloning techniques, it has been                    established that latent b5 and b6 are identical to their nominal                b5 and b6 counterparts.  The long term goal of this laboratory is               to investigate the regulation of these allelic and non-allelic                  genes.  The following studies will be pursued.  1) Using the                    latent b5 C kappa 1 gene as a model, genomic sequences encoding                 latent b5 will be investigated employing lymphoid tissue                        preparations as well as FACS-sorted B cells expressing latent b5.               Linkage of the latent b5 to the nominal b4 gene will be explored                using in situ hybridization, chromosome mapping, and pulsed field               electrophoresis.  2) The functional rearrangement of the latent                 b5 and b6 genes with V-kappa and J-kappa gene segments will be                  investigated.  3) It will be determined whether latent b9 kappa-1               sequences exist, and if so, functional recombination with V-kappa               and J-kappa regions will be probed.  4) Since rabbits have been                 found also to be expressing latent a2 and e14 following T.brucei                infection, mRNA encoding e14 will be identified by molecular                    cloning, and functional recombination with V-H, D-H, and J-H gene               elements for the chain will be investigated.  These studies                     focused on the expression and genomic organization of three                     separate latent allotype loci (kappa-1, VHa, CH-gamma) should                   unequivocally establish their existence at the DNA level,                       and begin to shed light on their function.                                                                                                                      The structure of immunoglobulin molecules is determined                         genetically, i.e., by the structure of the immunoglobulin genes                 which encode them.  The mechanisms by which immunoglobulin genes                undergo rearrangements and small changes in the structure of                    their antigen combining sites is the subject of much current                    research.  Apart from their antigen combining sites, however,                   immunoglobulin molecules have other distinct stuctural features                 which vary from one individual to another and are characteristic                for the immunoglobulins of a particular individual.  Allotypes                  are examples of such structural features.  Since allotypes                      correspond to segments of immunoglobulin molecules, they would be               expected to be inherited by the same rules as other genes.  It                  has been known for some time that in rabbits genetically                        unexpected allotypes are sometimes expressed.  This seems                       contrary to established principles of inheritance.  The proposed                research is a continuation of a project directed toward                         understanding the molecular basis for this long-standing genetic                enigma.  The results may demonstrate important exceptions to our                current ideas about immunoglobulin gene regulation.  In any case,               they will contribute to our overall understanding of                            immunoglobulin gene expression.",
