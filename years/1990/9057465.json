 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emphasis of this research is in Experimental                                Investigations of Convective Heat Transport in Complex                          Internal Flows.  Particularly emphasized is forced                              convection cooling of electronics, wherein the internal                         passageways formed by adjacent printed circuit boards promote                   highly disturbed flow.  Other examples of complex, internal                     heat transfer occur in gas-cooled heat exchangers where tube                    arrays form regions of through-flow interacting with separated                  flow and internal cooling of advanced gas turbine blades                        where heat transfer enhancement devices, such as short pin                      ins or periodic rib turbulators, are cast into the walls.  All                  of these internal flows exhibit phenomenological features that                  make them difficult to predict including:  (1) regions of                       separated and reattaching flow, (2) regions containing                          secondary motions, and (3) high levels of turbulence in the                     mean flow.  This research focuses on experimental studies                       on three canonical geometries that together exhibit all of                      these features.  These geometries are:  (1) the                                 two-dimensional rearward facing step, or surface fence, (2)                     the two-dimensional channel with repeated rib roughness, and                    (3) the two-dimensional channel with three-dimensional                          roughness on one or both walls.  The first configuration is                     the least specialized.  In this branch of the research, the                     effects of free-stream turbulence on the heat transfer in the                   recirculation, reattachment, and redeveloping boundary layer                    region are examined.  Specifically, the measurements include                    turbulent heat transfer and, simultaneously, momentum                           transport, in order to clarify existing models of turbulent                     diffusion in non-equilibrium wall flows.  The role of                           free-stream  turbulence in reattaching separated flows is                       largely unexplored, even though flow in real devices may be                     highly \"disturbed\" due to upstream effects.  The second major                   branch of the research centers on experimental investigations                   of fully-developed channel flow with regions of separation and                  reattachment as exhibited by the two-dimensional channel with                   repeated rib roughness and the channel with three-dimensional                   large roughness.  There is a remarkable unifying relationship                   between the convective heat transfer in all of these cases.                     For example, the dimensionless heat transfer rate, the Nusselt                  number, increases as about the 2/3 power of the Reynolds                        number in all of these cases.  Furthermore, this relationship                   seems to hold for both small-scale roughness, of certain                        types, and large-scale protrusions or ribs.  The transport                      phenomena that produce this universal behavior are being                        examined  with the hope of identifying the roles of scale,                      viscous and molecular diffusion, and turbulent transport.",
