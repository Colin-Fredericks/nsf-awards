 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on allosteric threonine deaminase from Escherichia coli                will reveal protein interactions that regulate enzyme activity.                 Cloning and high-level expression will aid in purifying wild-type               and mutant forms of threonine deaminase for their biochemical                   characterization.  Analysis of the protein concentration                        dependence of enzyme kinetic parameters will elucidate a model                  for the transition between low and high activity conformations.                 Identifying malfunctioning variants by classical genetics will                  reveal structural domains involved in catalysis and regulation,                 and their effect on the folding of polypeptides will be evaluated               by x-ray crystallography.  Sedimentation equilibrium studies of                 the tetramer-dimer interconversion of threonine deaminase will                  permit quantitative determination of changes in subunit                         interaction energy.  Direct ligand binding measurements by                      equilibrium dialysis, coupled with the energetics of dimer-                     tetramer assembly, will reveal the thermodynamic basis for                      cooperativity.  The cofactor pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, a                          chromophore in the active site, can reveal local changes promoted               by effector binding that alter catalysis.  Quantitative analysis                of absorption spectra in terms of sums of lognormal curves will                 establish a free energy profile for the enzyme to assess the                    effect of heterotropic ligands on each step of the reaction                     pathway.  Presteady-state kinetic studies will correlate the                    kinetic and thermodynamic effects of inhibitor binding.",
