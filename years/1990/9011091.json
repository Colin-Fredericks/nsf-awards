The                       two scientists have been collaborating for about two years                      on isolating microbes and searching for the presence of new                     Type II enzymes, and determining their sequence specificity.                    This project will allow the continuation of this research                       for isolation and taxonomical characterization of microbial                     strains from different local environment in Pakistan;                           screening of bacterial strains for the presence of Type II                      restriction endonucleases with special attention to enzymes                     with long recognition sequences; and the purification and                       characterization of the new restriction enzymes, and those                      with new specificities, with recognition of the site of                         cleavage.                                                                                                                                                       Scope: This project meets the criteria of the Science in                        Developmening Countries Program criteria for research                           participation by the U.S. and Pakistani scientists.  It                         allows for training of young scientists from Pakistan in one                    of the best U.S. laboratories in molecular biology research,                    and the application of modern techniques in that field to                       research being done in that country.  It also allows for                        creating a repository, in Pakistan, of restriction enzymes                      which are essential for molecular biology research.  That                       capability is important for research in basic and applied                       genetic engineering in Pakistan, and it also provides for                       increasing the diversity in the available enzymes for                           research in the U.S.",
