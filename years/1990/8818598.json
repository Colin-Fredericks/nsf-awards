Kim,                        Department of Physics, Purdue University, to pursue with                        Dr. Il-Tong Cheong, Department of Physics, Yonsei                               University, for a period of 24 months, a program of                             cooperative theoretical research on pion-nucleus                                reactions.  These nuclear reactions will be investigated on                     the basis of the quark bag model.  The researchers will                         calculate the pion photoproduction of light nuclei, the                         pion photoproduction by the three-nucleon systems, helium-3                     and tritium, and the pion photoproduction by nuclei heavier                     than helium-3.                                                                                                                                                  This project brings together two very talented nuclear                          theorists to work on a topic of current interest using                          calculational techniques that hold a good deal of promise                       for success.  Various models to be tested include those                         involving quarks and quark-antiquark pairs for processes                        that also can be studied experimentally.  The collaborators                     are highly respected workers in the field of this                               research.  This project is //",
