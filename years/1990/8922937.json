 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 10% and 40% of the Vanadium and Uranium entering the                    modern ocean as dissolved river input is eventually buried in                   sediments overlain by anoxic bottom water. Previous work by Dr.                 Emerson and his colleague Dr. Mix from Oregon State University                  has found that concentrations of V and U in foram tests have                    varied over the last 150 Kyrs. Provided the assumption is true                  that forams incorporate these metals in equilibrium with                        seawater, this preliminary data suggests that bottom water during               the last glacial period was more oxygenated that at present, and                that contrasts between Atlantic and Pacific bottom water was                    substantially different from that of today. In this renewal award               the PIs will to continue their research in several directions: 1)               they will perform culturing experiments with collaborator Dr.                   Erez in Israel to determine the uptake pattern of V and U in live               forams; 2) they will improve solid source mass spectometry                      technique for measuring V and U insingle species of forams; and                 3) they will apply these techniques to refine the history of                    anoxia in the world's oceans since the last interglacial.",
