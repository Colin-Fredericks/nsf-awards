 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Labiatae (mint family), one of the largest families of                 flowering plants, is of considerable medical and commercial                     importance because of the aromatic oils (terpenoids) that occur                 in the foliage of many species.  The ongoing search for useful                  plant products in this and other related families is greatly                    facilitated by an understanding of evolutionary relationships                   among the species.  A taxonomic classification that reflects                    evolutionary (that is, genealogical) history is likely to help                  researchers predict the occurrence of attributes (including                     useful chemical compounds) on the basis of the known distribution               of similar attributes elsewhere in the family.                                       The current classification of the mint family is based                     heavily on work done over a century ago and is founded on the                   assumption that the family is a natural group that likely evolved               from a single source in the Verbenaceae (teak) family.  This                    long-standing premise is contradicted by recent research by Dr.                 Philip Cantino at Ohio University, which suggests that the mints                have evolved from several different subgroups of the tropical                   Verbenaceae alliance.  A primary objective of the proposed                      research is to test this hypothesis using a computer analysis of                the distribution of a wide variety of morphological                             characteristics in both families, with special emphasis on new                  pollen data derived from light- and scanning electron microscopy.                                                                                               Integration of the pollen data with evidence from leaf, stem,                   flower, and fruit morphology will make it possible to resolve                   the evolutionary relationships among the major groups of genera                 of Labiatae and Verbenaceae.  This will represent a major step                  toward a more predictive and useful classification of both                      families, which in turn will facilitate the search for new,                     terpenoid characters.",
