 "awd_abstract_narration": "Introductory physics teaching has tended to treat relativity theory and         quantum mechanics as though they were totally disconnected from the rest                                                                                        of the field.  This project seeks to modify the traditional curriculum          by concentrating on those fundamental concepts that link classical and          twentieth-century physics, thereby bridging the gap between them,               demystifying the latter and making both more accessible to the beginning                                                                                        student.  Building on recent results from cognitive science research,           the project will use technology in two complementary ways:  (1)  to             create sophisticated yet inexpensive experiments capable of                     demonstrating some of the relevant physical effects and principles, and         (2)  to build powerful computer-based environments within which students                                                                                        will design their own simulated experiments that go far beyond what can         be achieved in the laboratory.  The computer tools will enable students         not only to model purely classical systems but, by varying parameters,          to pass continuously from the classical to the relativistic or quantum          regimes.  Students will thus be able to investigate effects that are            observable only at high speeds or small scales, displaying them in              multiple representations from any frame of reference.  In collaboration                                                                                         with high school and undergraduate teachers, we will create curriculum                                                                                          materials to make our software and experiments applicable to physics                                                                                            courses at many different levels.",
