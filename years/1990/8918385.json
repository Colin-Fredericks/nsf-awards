 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary relationships among parasitic flowering plants                are very poorly known because of frequent morphological                         reductions in floral and vegetative features.  The group of                     parasitic plants that will be examined in this project by Dr.                   Daniel Nickrent of University of Illinois is called the                         Santalales, an order that includes sandalwood, the familiar                     Christmas mistletoe, and several less familiar aerial and root                  parasites.  Evolutionary relationships within representatives of                several families in the order will be determined by comparison of               DNA sequences that code for ribosomal RNA (rDNA).  This will be                 accomplished by using a new technique called PCR which allows for               amplification of the amount of DNA in a sample, thus providing a                high enough concentration for sequencing.  Generation of rDNA                   sequences is rapid and efficient and provides a large number of                 characters (nucleotide bases) useful in determining                             relationships.                                                                       In addition to representatives of the five families in the                 Santalales, sequences of other plants doubtfully included in this               order will be determined to ascertain their correct taxonomic                   placement.  This second group of parasites includes the enigmatic               and spectacular Rafflesia which has the largest flower among all                flowering plants, as well as some tiny-flowered parasites                       originally (and incorrectly) classified with the fungi.                         Representatives from other orders thought to be related to these                parasites will also be sequenced thus providing information                     relating to the origin of parasitism in the flowering plants.",
