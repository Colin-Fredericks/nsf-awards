 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this proposal is to apply a general equilibrium                  model designed to assess the effects of US tax policies aimed at                encouraging investment.  This model will be applied in an open                  economy context which will account for the interactions between                 the U.S. economy and the rest of the world.  An important                       innovation in this research is that particular attention will be                paid to the international flows of financial capital and the                    international cross-ownership of capital stocks.  Two main types                of policies will be examined.  One type involves policies aimed                 at the promotion of domestic savings.  These policies include                   proposals to base the individual income tax more exclusively on                 consumption.  The second type emphasizes the promotion of                       domestic investment.  These policies include tax credits for                    investments in domestic plant and equipment, and reductions in                  statutory U.S. corporate income tax rates.  The various policy                  options will be analyzed along a number of dimensions including                 effects on domestic and foreign welfare; on saving and investment               by domestic and foreign households; on the size, ownership, and                 industrial allocation of the U.S. capital stock; and on the trade               balance and other components of the balance of payments.",
