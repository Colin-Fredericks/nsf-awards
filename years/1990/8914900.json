 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two current approaches to studying interspecific competition               in the field provide inconclusive results.  These are behavioral                observations of individuals in the presence and absence of their                putative competitors, and population removal experiments.                       Behavioral studies rarely measure the effects of competition on                 individual fitness, and population studies seldom elucidate the                 underlying causal mechanisms of competition.  A synthetic                       approach is needed which simultaneously measures resource                       availability, effects of competitors upon their shared limiting                 resources and on one another, and effects of competition on                     individual fitness.  This study will apply this synthetic                       approach to foraging competition between Townsend's solitaires                  and other species which feed upon juniper berries during the                    nonbreeeding season.  It will quantify both interference and                    exploitive effects of competitors on individual solitaires                      defending winter feeding territories.  It will also measure the                 fitness of 50-60 solitaires over two years by monitoring                        overwinter survival and fledgling success.  Quantifying the                     relationship between the intensity of competition experienced by                individual solitaires and their fitness will provide an empirical               test of the evolutionary significance of interspecific                          competition to this species.",
