 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  Under this project, scientists from the U.S.                      and from India will work to enlarge the data base on the                        motion of sunspots.  The source of the new data is the Indian                   white-light solar plates began in 1905 in the Kodaikanal                        Observatory, which is of excellent quality.  The combination                    of the Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson data could make the finest                   sunspot data set in existence.  It will provide many times                      the number of sunspots now available for statistical studies                    of rotation and latitude drift and spot areas.  This will                       increase the precision of the averaged results for the                          cycle-related rotation rate changes found in the data set.                      It will also increase the confidence in small-amplitude                         effects which is low given the the limits of the U.S. data                      set, as well as increase the potential for detecting                            low-amplitude effects.  These measured drifts have an                           important bearing on the large-scale dynamics of the solar                      convection zone and is believed to be responsible for the                       11-year activity cycle.                                                                                                                                         Scope:  The U.S. P.I. Dr. Robert Howard, of the National                        Solar Observatory (NSO) in Tucson, AZ, and the Indian P.I.                      Dr. K.R. Sivaraman, of the Indian Institute of Astrophysics,                    (IIA) in Bangalore, India have collaborated in earlier                          studies under the Mount Wilson Program funded by NSF/AST.                       This action extends and formalizes the international                            collaboration by providing funds to the NSO for the per diem                    of the Indian scientists, and providing IIA with funds in                       Indian currency for travel to the U.S. and for computer                         operation for digitization of data.                                                                                                                             Funding:  This project is being funded under two grants:                                                                                                               1.
