The conference has as its major objective the                         transfer of information and knowledge on ecophysiological                       problems relating to saline soils.  The PI, Dr. D.W. Rains,                     is one of the leading active researchers in the field.  The                     conference is organized in cooperation with the Institute                       Agronomique et Veterinaire Hassan II, a staff member of                         which, Dr. R. Choukr-Allah, will serve as local organizer.                      Both the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of                            Interior have been invited to address the conference.                                                                                                           Scope:  The five-day conference will include invited                            participants from 24 different countries.  Lectures and                         poster sessions will address the following topics:                              mechanisms of salt tolerance, genetic aspects of salt                           tolerance, crop management under saline conditions,                             halophyte utilization in agriculture, and soil and water                        management aspects of irrigation with highly saline water.                      NSF support will help allow seven experts from the U.S.                         participate in the conference.  As the conference is                            research oriented and focused on developing country                             problems, this proposal fulfils objectives of the Science in                    Developing Countries Program.",
