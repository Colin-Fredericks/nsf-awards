This project documents the negotiated transition to democracy in                Hungary.  The researchers focus on the unprecedented negotiations in            which the ruling communist party reached agreements with                        representatives of opposition parties and trade unions to establish             the conditions for competitive political parties, contested                     elections, and parliamentary governance.  These intensive roundtable            negotiations, involving several hundred bargaining sessions (in                 plenary, committee, and subcommittee meetings), were conducted from             June 13th to September 17th, 1989.                                                                                                                              A complete reconstruction of the negotiating process requires                   interviews with the main participants supplemented by reports from              social scientists who observed the process.  This project involves              the use of existing tape recordings, minutes, and other summaries of            various bargaining sessions, as well as in-depth interviews with                those who participated in the process.  All materials will be                   cataloged and archived for use by other social scientists interested            in studying the transition to democracy in Hungary.                                                                                                             The project should add considerably to our understanding of how a               democratic political system with representative institutions and a              vital public sphere is constructed.",
