It addresses the                                     seismic performance of tieback retaining                                        walls.                                                                                                                                                          Tieback retaining walls are commonly used for                                   the temporary support of excavations for                                        building construction.  These types of                                          support systems are typically designed on the                                   basis of empirical experience with little, if                                   any, thought given to seismic design                                            requirements.  Questions regarding the                                          seismic performance of these types of                                           structures are becoming more important with                                     the increasing use of these walls for the                                       permanent support of excavation cuts.  While                                    earthquake-related failures of tieback walls                                    have not been reported in the literature, it                                    is not clear if this fortunate circumstance                                     is due to a conservative (but expensive)                                        design practice, or to the limited number of                                    cases where these types of walls have been                                      subjected to earthquake ground motions.                                                                                                                         The aim of this project is to enhance the                                       current state-of-the-art in the seismic                                         design of tieback retaining walls by                                            reviewing the performance of existing walls -                                    both temporary and permanent - in the San                                      Francisco Bay area that were subjected to the                                   ground shaking from the Loma Prieta                                             earthquake.  Particular emphasis is given to                                    tieback walls constructed with the \"soil                                        nailing\" technique, which is relatively new                                     in the United States.  Available information                                    on the horizontal displacement of the walls                                     and/or load increases in the tiebacks within                                    the walls, and on any damage experienced, is                                    studied; these data are compared to the                                         general design practice for these types of                                      walls.                                                                                                                                                          The benefit of this research is that it will                                    improve the state of the engineering practice                                   in the design of permanent tieback walls.                                       This should facilitate the widespread use of                                    tieback retaining walls in areas of high                                        seismicity, leading to a safer and more                                         economical design.",
