 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study focuses on several globally important,                               crustforming orogenic processes that have been active during                    the complex tectonic history of the Pacific margin of                           Antarctica.  This award supports a comprehensive geophysical                    survey (i.e., MCS, gravity, magnetics, sonobuoys and multi-                     beam bathymetry) of two parts of the Antarctic Peninsula to                     illuminate the role of the South Shetland Islands-Bransfield                    Trough region as a modern analog of Andean orogenic                             processes and as a specific step toward tectonic                                reconnaissance of the less accessible and therefore more                        poorly known parts of the West Antarctic margin bordering                       the Bellingshausen and Amundsen seas.  By integrating the                       marine data with onshore geologic observations and kinematic                    plate motion histories, this investigation should be able to                    make real progress towards increased understanding of the                       following processes:  Andean-type orogenesis; continental                       lithosphere extension in a convergent continental margin                        setting; ridge crest subduction; and interaction of large-                      offset fracture zones with convergent margins, including the                    uplift of subduction complexes.                                                                                                                                 The study will provide impetus for the U.S. Antarctic                           Geoscience Initiative by undertaking the most ambitious                         Antarctic marine geophysical study yet carried out by any                       nation.",
