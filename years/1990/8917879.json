 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myc family oncogenes share a similar gene organization, encode                  DNA binding nuclear phosphoproteins, possess similar oncogenic                  activities, and are expressed in a distinctive temporal and                     spatial manner during normal murine development. The differential               or coordinate expression of myc family genes may influence the                  processes leading to cellular commitment and differentiation. To                better understand the biological functions of myc family                        oncogenes in mammalian development, Dr. DePinho will characterize               the developmental role of c-, N-, L-myc gene products in several                well defined in vitro differentiation systems and in the                        developing mouse embryo. In vitro systems he will examine the                   biological impact of forced or absent myc expression on cellular                differentiation. Altered myc activity will be achieved with the                 help of constitutive myc expression constructs and with the help                of inducible antisense constructs. To study the normal role of                  myc in the developing animal, Dr. DePinho will produce mice which               are inactive at both L-myc alleles. Gene disruption will make use               of homologous recombination and embryonic stem cell techniques to               produce germ line chimeras. The experiments proposed will provide               further insight into the biological significance of c-, N-, and                 L-myc in normal mouse development.                                              %%%                                                                             Genes, called oncogenes, were first discovered due to their                     ability to cause transformation to malignant phenotypes in                      cultured cells.. These genes have since been shown to be involved               in the normal development of an embryo. This study proposes to                  determine what the role of one of these gene families plays in                  normal development.",
