 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Microbiology at the              University of Alabama for the continuation and improvement of                   laboratory instruction in two related courses:  Immunology                      Laboratory, and Cell Culture and Hybridoma Technology.  Both                    courses are intensive project-based laboratory experiences designed             to demonstrate the underlying principles of many modern laboratory              procedures.  The unreliability or unavailability of appropriate                 equipment endangers the continuation and improvement of the well-               established Immunology Laboratory and the continuation beyond its               initial trial offering of the newly created hybridoma course.                   Equipment to be purchased with this award includes:  two cell                   culture work stations (laminar flow biological safety cabinet,                  inverted phase contrast microscope, waterbath)  and a double-                   chambered water-jacketed CO2 incubator for Cell Culture and                     Hybridoma Technology; and four UV/visible spectrophotometers,                   polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis equipment, and a low-speed high-             volume refrigerated centrifuge for Immunology Laboratory.  The                  combination of these two courses will provide students with an                  introduction to modern immunologic techniques followed by the                   applications of these techniques to the specialized field of                    production and use of monoclonal antibodies.  While the number of               students that will complete this training is relatively low, the                intensity of training is very high.  In addition, the equipment                 will impact upon a larger number of students in lower division                  courses through the introduction of new demonstrations and expanded             experiments and will enhance the undergraduate research program.                The grantee is matching this award with funds from non-Federal                  sources.",
