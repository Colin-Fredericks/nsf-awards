 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate (i) the acoustic correlates of the              segment, syllable, and mora in Icelandic, (ii) the mora timing                  hypothesis and the segment timing hypothesis, via the contrasting               stress, syllable and rhythm systems in Icelandic, English and Spanish,          and (iii) the effects on timing due to within word position and                 position with higher syntactic and prosodic structures.  The goal is            to explore the relationship between phonological and phonetic                   components of language and to determine the nature of the timing                systems controlling different prosodic constituents.                              The interactive component includes research seminar and colloquia,            participation in ongoing faculty workshop and lab meetings, and two             courses.  The two courses are a graduate research seminar on \"Rhythm,           Timing and Prosodic Structure\" and an undergraduate lecture and lab             course on \"Linguistics, Law and Science.\"                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
