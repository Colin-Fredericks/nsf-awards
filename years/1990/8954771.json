 "awd_abstract_narration": "As stated so well by the Physics Curriculum Development Project of the          Netherlands (PLON), physical science lessons should aim to stimulate            students to be actively involved in the study of science.  One way PLON         units did that was to develop thematic science units on Bridges, Traffic        and Safety (which includes bicycles), and Traffic (which includes               collisions) for use with students from age 12 to 18 years.    During the        early 1980s, the staff of this project collaborated on three different          interactive videodisc (IV) activities to develop discs for college              physics courses.  These disc projects were The Puzzle of the Tacoma             Narrows Bridge Collapse, Energy Transformations Featuring the Bicycle,          and Physics and Automobile Collisions.                                                                                                                          For the past eight years, the Department of Physics Education of the            University of Amsterdam has been developing a Scientific and                    Technological Open Learning Environment (STOLE) that brings micro-              computer based laboratory (MBL) equipment and lessons into the high             school physics classrooms of the Netherlands.                                                                                                                   This project will form a bi-national steering committee to create               unified thematic physical science that can be used by high school               students in both the United States of America and the Netherlands.  The         basic physical science concepts from the printed PLON units will be             brought together with the interactive videodisc (IV) lessons supported          by MBL activities using the STOLE computer interfaces and apparatus.            The resulting thematic physical science lessons will include the best           features of these three innovative aspects of contemporary science              curricular materials:  interesting and relevant applications,                   interactive video lessons, and micro-computer based laboratory                  activities.",
