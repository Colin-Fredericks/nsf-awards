 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research the investigators propose a new theory of coalition            formation in order to understand the process by which governments are           assembled in multiparty parliamentary democracies.                                                                                                              The literature on coalition theory is a rich one, extending back more           than thirty years.  To date, however, this literature has not come to           grips with the fact that government coalitions are different from               coalitions in general - - that the forming of a government is a                 vastly different event from that of passing a legislative bill or               dividing up a pie.  These latter events may be thought of as                    \"terminal\" - - once a bill is passed or a pie divided, business is              essentially done.  In forming a government, however, the processes of           politics have only just begun. Thus, in thinking about government               formation, it is essential that one incorporate the rational beliefs            and expectations of the actors concerning what will happen once the             government is installed.                                                                                                                                        This observation allows the Principal Investigator to formulate a               theory of strategic bargaining by the various parties elected to a              popular assembly.  Their objective is to form a government, which               action requires a majority vote of support in the assembly.  The                various actors couch their support or opposition to a proposal for a            new government in terms of their beliefs of what results will flow              from installing this group of parties as opposed to that group of               parties.  But where are these beliefs about the future to come from?            This is the crucial aspect of the research by the investigators.                They define and elaborate the notion of credible promises and use               this concept to develop a theory of how the various forces inside a             popular assembly combine to form a government.                                                                                                                  Besides its contribution to basic knowledge, this research is of                pactical significance as more and more parts of the world turn to               parliamentary institutions in which many (rather than just two)                 parties contest for power and governmental leadership.",
