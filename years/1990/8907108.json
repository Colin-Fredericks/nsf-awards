 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in theoretical                         molecular chemistry to be conducted by William Lester of the                    University of California at Berkeley and Carlton Taft of                        CBPF, the Brazilian Center for Physics Research in Rio de                       Janeiro.  The work will involve theoretical studies of the                      electronic structure, bonding and other properties of                           molecules.  Systems will be selected from two classes of                        molecules that are the focus of much current research.  These                   are van der Waals complexes and metallic clusters.                                                                                                              The UC Berkeley group has pioneered the development of the                      quantum Monte Carlo method and has considerable experience                      with both ab initio and multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock (HF)                    calculations as well as configuration interaction methods for                   small and modest-size systems.  The Brazilian group focuses                     typically on larger systems using multiple scattering (x-                       rays), Hartree-Fock and generalized valence-bond methods.                       The respective experience and expertise of each group clearly                   complements the other.  The collaboration will provide a                        mutually beneficial research experience for both groups.",
