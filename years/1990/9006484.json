 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed by Daniel Howard and John Doherty                    addresses some of the most difficult problems in biology;                       namely, how does reproductive isolation (the absence of                         interbreeding between individuals of different species) develop                 as one species splits into two and, in particular, what is the                  role of selection against hybridization in the evolution of                     reproductive barriers?  Answers to these questions are central to               an understanding to the development and conservation of                         biological diversity on earth.  The questions will be approached                by studying ground crickets that are in the process of splitting                to form new species.  Answers obtained from the study will be                   relevant to all sexually reproducing organisms.                                      Research over the past three years has identified male                     calling song differences as a potential reproductive barrier                    between the newly forming species, Allonemobius fasciatus and A.                socius.  The identification of this potential barrier during a                  critical stage of species formation provides a rare opportunity                 to study the evolution of reproductive isolation during a                       speciation event.  During the next three years, the hypothesis                  of reinforcement will be tested.  This hypothesis states that                   the calling song displacement exhibited by A. fasciatus in areas                where it occurs with A. socius represents a reproductive barrier                that has evolved as a consequence of selection against                          hybridization.  The work will include investigations of :  (1)                  geographic variation in male calling song, (2) female response to               song, (3) the genetics of song differences, (4) the cost of a                   hybrid mating, and (5) sperm competition.  The proposed studies                 will not only provide a rigorous test of the hypothesis of                      reinforcement, but they will provide fundamental information on a               trait potentially responsible for reproductive isolation.  Only                 by combining studies of the genetics, behavioral ecology, and                   developmental biology of specific traits serving as reproductive                barriers with analyses of geographic distribution patterns, will                biologists arrive at an understanding of the process of                         speciation.  The proposed research should lead into even more                   rigorous studies of the acquisition of reproductive isolation                   between A. fasciatus and socius.  These species are rapidly                     becoming a model system for the study of biological processes.                       From an applied perspective, the family Gryllidae (crickets)               includes some very serious agricultural pests.  The proposed                    research will provide badly needed information on the                           reproductive biology of crickets - information that can be used                 to help develop biological control programs.",
