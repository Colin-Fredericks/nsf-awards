Focused on a district with a predominantly                         Hispanic population, the project will support minority                          students who exhibit potential in mathematics, help                             parents to encourage their children in mathematics, and                         improve the mathematical knowledge and instructional                            strategies of teachers in grades K through 6.                                                                                                                   Thirty-three teachers in each of three elementary schools                       will participate in the project, which includes                                 instruction in mathematics content and methodology and                          emphasizes the use of calculators.  In order to                                 accommodate the region's year-round schools, this                               instruction will take place on fifteen weekends                                 throughout the year.  It will be carried out by three                           teams of three teachers each (two elementary teachers who                       participated in the previous project and one high school                        teacher).  Other project activities include a bimonthly                         newsletter and visits by project staff to participants'                         classrooms.  Evaluation will include assessing the                              project's effects on teachers, students, and parents.                                                                                                           The university and the school district are contributing                         as cost-sharing an amount equal to 159% of the NSF award.",
