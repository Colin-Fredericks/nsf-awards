 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Geoffrey                 Clark will excavate a deeply stratified archaeological site, Ain                Difla, located in West-Central Jordan.  Prior work indicates that               the successive levels are rich in both faunal remains and stone                 tools which are associated with the Mousterian culture.  Dr.                    Clark will continue the excavation there to collect large samples               of both cultural and faunal remains.  Using the                                 thermolumenencence technique he hopes to obtain absolute dates on               burnt flint.  With these data, he will then be able to                          reconstruct successive environments and to show how Mousterian                  culture developed over time and adapted to these changes.                                                                                                       This area and time period are of great archaeological                           significance because fossils seem to indicate the concurrent                    presence of both early modern humans as well as a more archaic                  Neanderthal form.  It is unclear when and where anatomically                    modern humans first appear in Europe and the Near East and                      whether the later form develops directly from the earlier.  Some                anthropologists argue for in situ development while others                      believe that replacement occurred.  Archaeological data such as                 Clark will collect are relevant to this issue.  Mousterian                      culture is traditionally associated with Neanderthals, and                      Clark's materials should show whether this tradition at some                    point changed and whether this may be associated with the                       appearance of a different way of life.                                                                                                                          This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of the emergence of anatomically modern humans.  It               will also provide data of interest to a large group of                          archaeologists.",
