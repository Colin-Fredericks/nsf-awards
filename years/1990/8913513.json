 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Dr. Arthur S. Goldberg of Long Island University at                             Southampton and Dr. John C. Coll of James Cook University of                    North Queensland, Australia. This research is to investigate                    indicators, such as, toxicity, of the presence of chemical                      defense substances in worms of the marine annelid family.                       Chemical studies will be carried out aimed at isolating and                     determining the structures of those compounds used for                          chemical defense. Building on these studies, the effects of                     these chemical defenses on the diverse marine ecosystems found                  in the coastal waters of central and northeastern Australia                     will be explored.                                                                                                                                               The project represent excellent collaboration between the                       Australian group and its interest in marine natural products                    and chemical ecology, and the Goldberg work on marine                           repellent toxins. This is important fundamental work in the                     chemistry of worms of the marine annelid family and the role                    they play in the marine environment, as well as having                          potential for isolation of bioactive compounds with useful                      applications.",
