 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Solomon Sea is a small ocean basin 1000 km north of the                     Great Barrier Reef of northeast Australia that is gradually                     disappearing as the Papuan Peninsula of eastern New Guinea                      collides with the New Britain island arc.  This oblique                         collision has been completed along its western extremity and                    has resulted in the fold and trust belt on the island of New                    Guinea.  Drs. Silver and Reed will to conduct a 32-day survey                   of the Solomon Sea to study the structural and sedimentologic                   processes involved in this collision process, the features of                   which are a contemporary analog to the Laramide orogeny that                    formed the eastern Rocky Mountains.   23 days of seafloor                       imaging will be conducted with SeaMarcII; these data will be                    supplemented by simultaneous collection of single channel                       airgun profiles, 3.5 KHz echosounding records, magnetics and                    gravity.  7 days will be devoted to collecting piston cores,                    and during 2 additional days, bottom photographs will be                        collected.  Participants from the Geological Survey of Papua                    New Guinea and the Australian National University will join the                 cruise and conduct subsequent analyses.  The entire data set                    will make possible the comparison to structures and                             sedimentation observed onshore in the fold and thrust belt of                   New Guinea, and provide better understanding of orogenic                        processes.",
