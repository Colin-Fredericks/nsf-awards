 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a travel request to attend the 5th World Filtration                     Congress in Nice, France.  Originated and organized in Paris                    by the French Filtration Society in 1974, the First Congress                    was a success in identifying the processing and technology                      problems of that period associated with filtration.  Since                      then three other Congresses have been held, in London in 1979,                  in Dowington, PA (USA), in 1982, and in Ostend (Belgium), in                    1986.  The major theme of the 5th Congress is separation by                     filtration, giving due attention to the increasingly                            significant role of membranes.  Emphasis is on the adaptation                   of processes to market requirements, energy savings, and                        quality of life.",
