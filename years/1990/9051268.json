 "awd_abstract_narration": "The touchstone of a Manufacturing Systems Engineering curriculum is the         synergistic integration of materials design, mechanical design, and             manufacturing processing system design.  The function of this project           is to support the development of a Design for Manufacturability and             Assemblability Studio (DFMA) for the practicum sessions in the course,          Design for Manufacture.  The DFMA Studio achieves 3 functions:  (1)             Design for Manufacture and Assembly Analysis;  (2) Evaluation of                Handling and Orientation, and (3) Assembly/Disassembly Evaluation.  Six         Zenith ZSF-285-25 personal computer stations equipped with Boothroyd            Dewhurst Design for Assembly Toolkit software and Design for                    Manufacture Toolkit software comprises the DFMA Analysis Studio.  Four          POSI-I mechanically programmable vibratory bowl feeders with                    Programmable Silhouette Recognizer evaluate the orientability and               feedability of a part as a function of component form.  American                Company System R Modular Workstations with hand tools and pneumatic             tools constitute a facility for assembly/disassembly evaluation.  This          DFMA Studio provides the undergraduate engineering student with the             practical evaluation of product design for manufacture.                                                                                                         The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
