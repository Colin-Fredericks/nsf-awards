 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a program of research in heavy ion                 nuclear physics at the Nuclear Structure Laboratory, State                      University of New York at Stony Brook, using a superconducting                  booster accelerator in conjunction with a model FN tandem                       accelerator.  Together with the experimental equipment and                      measurement techniques developed by the Stony Brook group, this                 capability makes possible an unusually sophisticated and                        diverse range of experiments.  Continued development of                         research equipment, including superconducting accelerator                       technology, will be carried out in parallel with the nuclear                    science program.                                                                                                                                                     Collective excitations of nuclei at high excitation                        energies, and giant resonances, in particular, will be studied                  with observation of the decay gamma radiation.  These studies                   probe shape changes as a function of nuclear temperature.  The                  properties of nuclei having very high angular momenta will be                   measured using an array of Compton suppressed, high resolution                  Ge detectors.  This work probes changes in shape and                            microscopic nuclear structure as a function of angular                          momentum.                                                                                                                                                            Laser spectroscopy will be used to study nuclei far from                   stability.  Laser spectroscopy provides information on nuclear                  sizes and shapes via hyperfine structure measurements.                                                                                                               Anomalous enhancements in the cross section for subbarrier                 fusion of heavy nuclei will be studied through measurements                     using a new Bragg curve spectrometer.  Measurements of                          particle-particle correlations will be made and analyzed to                     study nucleus-nucleus reaction dynamics.  A special detector                    array has been assembled for this purpose.                                                                                                                           The research will be carried out by five faculty members,                  fifteen graduate students and five post-doctoral fellows.",
