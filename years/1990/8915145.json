 "awd_abstract_narration": "Severe storm waves can cause downslope mass movements of a                      sloping seafloor in various magnitudes including massive                        failure.  Permanent displacements, even not reaching a                          massive failure, can be large enough to be destructive to                       structures on or in the seafloor.  Therefore, in offshore and                   coastal development, both the magnitude of permanent                            displacements and possibility of a massive failure must be                      evaluated for intensive wave loading in order to avoid                          catastrophic consequences.  This research will develop a                        practical and yet rational analysis-based method to evaluate                    wave loading in a systematic manner for slightly sloping                        seafloors.  The displacement-based approach will be adopted                     since it can account for various complexities of wave-induced                   environments in a failure evaluation and, at the same time,                     can provide the magnitude of the permanent displacements.                       The evaluation method will be developed through wave tank                       model tests, case history studies and analytical studies, and                   will be coded in a computer program.",
