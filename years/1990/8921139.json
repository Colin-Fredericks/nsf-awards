 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of nonlinear dynamics is rapidly growing in the importance            both in basic research and in applications.  Interest in nonlinear              dynamics is increasing in optical communications, optical switching,            and optical computing.  In addition, interest in quantum mechanical             phenomena is growing owing to its impact on enhanced signal to noise            ratio, reduced error rates in switching devices and enhanced                    sensitivity in instruments such as interferometers and gyroscopes.              The proposed theoretical research will cover nonlinear classical                dynamics, where coupled expressions of importance in soliton optical            switching will be examined, including femtosecond duration solitons.            The research will also cover nonclassical minimum uncertainty states            (optical squeezing), examining dissipation and amplification, soliton           self-frequency shift, multibeam phenomena, and number-phase minimum             uncertainty states.",
