 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a group of U.S. chemists to participate in a small          international workshop on dynamical stereochemistry in molecular                collision processes, to be held in Santa Cruz, California, between              November 16 and 21, 1990.  The meeting is co-organized by Dr. David             Parker of the University of California, Santa Cruz and Dr. Steven               Stolte of the Chemistry Department, the Free University of Amsterdam.           The conference will bring together key researchers and several young            scientists in the full range of disciplines in this rapidly expanding           field on the forefront of chemical physics.  They will produce a                thorough assessment of the present state of knowledge and delineate             the directions and level of effort needed for promising future                  research.  Both theoretical and experimental progress will be                   addressed.                                                                                                                                                      The range and tools of dynamical stereochemists have expanded                   dramatically in the past few years and now include direct probes of             the transition state and real-time measurements of product appearance           and polarization.  A major theme of the meeting will be vector                  properties in molecular scattering processes.  The aim of this                  research is to understand how chemical and physical change occur via            collisions; the approach is to measure correlations between the                 various directional properties involved.  The program also includes             discussion of two very new areas of stereochemical research:                    femtochemistry and steric models of solution dynamics.  The proceedings         of the conference will be published as a special issue of the Journal           of Physical Chemistry.",
