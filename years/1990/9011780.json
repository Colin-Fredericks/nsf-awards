 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this proposal the principal investigator will continue                his analysis of mathematical models of certain polymers and                     metals in order to predict the failure of these materials when                  external forces are applied.  The mathematical models come from                 the theories of nonlinear elasticity and viscoelasticity, and                   their analysis involves the study of singular solutions of                      hyperbolic and elliptic systems and the use of techniques from                  the calculus of variations.                                                          The most common way of testing when a polymer or metal will                fail under the influence of an external force is to subject the                 actual material to loading until it breaks or deforms.  This is                 fine if one is interested only in the gross properties of the                   material, but if one wants to understand why the material fails                 at a given load then one must have recourse to mathematical                     models of the material.  In this grant the principal investigator               will use advanced mathematics to uncover the mechanisms of                      failure and fracture in polymers and metals by examining systems                of partial differential equations from the theory of                            viscoelasticity.",
