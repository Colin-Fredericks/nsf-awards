 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research in this laboratory has shown that the fish gill, like         the mammalian lung, has the unique ability to regulate the                      concentration of a variety of hormones in blood through specific                activation and inactivation processes.  All blood pumped by the fish            heart must first pass through the gills before it is distributed to the         rest of the body.  Thus the gill is in an ideal location to effectively         serve as a biological blood filter, and indeed, the PI has shown that           the efficiency of hormone metabolism by the gill may exceed 90%.  The           proposed research will examine the mechanisms through which the gill            metabolizes several important blood pressure regulating hormones,               catecholamines, angiotensin and atrial natriuretic peptide.                     Preliminary studies have also shown that these same mechanisms may be           involved in degradation of toxic substances and these studies will be           continued.  This project is significant for several reasons: 1.                 Information derived from these studies will further our understanding           of endocrine control systems in lower vertebrates.  2. Due to the               similarity between gills and lungs the present work will provide                insight into the evolution of the lung as a metabolic organ and the             mechanisms of pulmonary metabolism.  These studies also illustrate the          potential of the gill as an alternative, non-mammalian model in                 biomedical research.  3. Evaluation of the gill as an organ for                 detoxification has not been critically examined.  Our preliminary work          indicates that the gill may also be an important tool in environmental          studies.",
