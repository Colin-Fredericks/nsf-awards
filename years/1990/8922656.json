 "awd_abstract_narration": "Permitting procedures for hazardous waste incinerators usually                  require a test burn in which the incinerator is shown to                        achieve at least 99.99% destruction of the principal hazardous                  components.  Hazardous waste incinerators are designed to                       achieve this goal with a substantial safety margin.                             Unfortunately, however, they sometimes fail to achieve the                      required degree of destruction of the material, especially                      when the hazardous materials are present in low initial                         concentrations.  Theoretical arguments are advanced which show                  that the conventional tests of incinerability involve a                         fallacy and can overestimate the extent to which a hazardous                    material will be destroyed.  These arguments are supported by                   computer modeling and directly confirmed by laboratory                          measurements.                                                                                                                                                   A novel method for improving incinerator effectiveness is                       proposed.  Computer modeling shows that this method can be                      highly effective and experiments with a number of difficult to                  incinerate, hazardous chemicals show that improvements in                       incinerator effectiveness of 1,000 or more can be achieved.                     Commercialization of this technology would allow incinerators                   to destroy toxic organic materials with reduced emissions of                    those materials to the atmosphere.  While this is of critical                   importance to incinerators used to destroy dioxins, PCBs,                       nerve gases, and other extremely toxic materials, the costs of                  this improvement are thought to be modest, and the scheme is                    expected to have broad applicability.",
