 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurate dynamic measurement of the contiguous and non-contiguous               components of multiphase fluid flow systems is of signal interest               to the chemical process and energy industries.  Until now these                 have been many attempts to accurately assess the phases present                 in such liquid systems with little processes to date.  Most of                  these early attempts to utilize capacitance or dielectric type                  probes which were evasive and were subject to fouling or                        otherwise rendered inoperative ats some time during the period of               measurement.  This proposal addresses the problem by a non-                     invasive ultrasonic technique.                                                                                                                                  The proposed study will focus on the feasibility of developing a                probe for monitoring quantitatively the dispersed phase fraction                of an oil-water dispersion.  This technique is based upon the                   time of passage of an ultrasonic signal through a flowing two                   phase liquid system.   The variables will be the effective                      droplet size, wall thickness and geometry, wall material, fluid                 composition, temperature, pressure, and signal pathlength.  The                 impact of these and other variables will be assessed under a wide               range of flow conditions.  The PI's appear well qualified for                   this work and their facilities appear to be adequate.",
