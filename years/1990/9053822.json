The                   partnership proposes to use existing private sector and                         educational relationships and networks to develop and pilot                     integrated instructional packages in 4 target USD 259 schools                   over a 4-year period. Private sector technical personnel will be                involved in planning and providing instruction.  After                          evaluation, these units will be disseminated throughout school                  systems in the country and made available nationally.                                                                                                           Anticipated results include: (1) integration of private sector                  technical personnel in projects to improve science and                          mathematics education, (2) integration of current applications                  of science and mathematics into course content, (3) improvement                 of science and mathematics teaching, (4) improved science and                   mathematics learning among all student populations in local                     schools, and (5) involvement in science and mathematics learning                and improved performance by students from population segments                   traditionally underserved in technically-based careers.",
