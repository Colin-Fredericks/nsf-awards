 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our long term goal is to investigate the molecular mechanisms                   underlying the genetic control of sexual development in                         Drosophila.  Because many of the genes in the sex determination                 pathway are regulated by RNA processing, these studies will                     also contribute to our understanding of alternative RNA                         splicing as a means of gene regulation.  Our research is                        focused on the sans-fille (snf) gene.  Genetic studies suggest                  that snf plays a key role in the sexual decision making process                 in both the germline and the soma.  To further our                              understanding of this newly identified gene we propose: 1) To                   determine whether snf is required only for sex determination                    or whether it has a more generalized function in development                    by analyzing null alleles of the locus. 2) To initiate a                        detailed molecular characterization of the snf gene and its                     products and 3) To place snf in the regulatory hierarchy of sex                 determination genes by a combined molecular and genetic                         approach.                                                                                                                                                       In the fruit fly Drosophila individuals with an X and a Y                       chromosome develop into males and those with 2X chromosomes                     develop into females.  The decision of which developmental                      pathway to adopt is made during embryonic life by every cell                    in the body of the embryo.  We have known since the early years                 of this century that the cells make their decision by counting                  the number of X chromosomes they contain, but it is only over                   the past decade that more  of the details of the mechanism by                   which the decision is made have been elucidated.  This is a                     proposal to study a recently discovered early step in this                      mechanism.",
