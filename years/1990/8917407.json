It is submitted by the American Geological                     Institute on behalf of the U.S. National Committee (USNC) for                   IGCP.  This proposal encompasses 17 projects at an average cost                 of $5,000 each.  The budget of each project has been reviewed by                the USNC for IGCP.                                                                   IGCP is a multidisciplinary scientific program established                 in its present form in 1973, sponsored jointly by the                           International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and by the                    United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.               The principal goal of IGCP is to promote international                          cooperation in research on global geologic problems, with                       emphasis on the nature and sequence of major geologic events,                   geologic hazards and energy and mineral resources.  Program work                is carried out through 52 individual research projects, 17 of                   which have U.S. working groups.",
