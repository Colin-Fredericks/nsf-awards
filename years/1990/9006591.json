 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gibberellic acid (GA), a plant hormone, regulates several important             physiological and developmental processes such as seed germination,             post-germination growth, stem elongation and flower induction.                  Together with another hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), GA is known to              regulate the synthesis and secretion of several enzymes which are               responsible for the utilization of nutrients stored in the seed.  The           enzymes are essential for post-germination growth of many cereal                grains.  The most abundant of these enzymes is alpha-amylase, which             degrades starch.  As part of a long term effort to elucidate the mode           of action of GA and ABA this research will focus on gene expression in          the aleurone layers of germinating barley seeds.                                                                                                                Previous research has revealed that hormone-mediated regulation of              enzyme expression in the barley-aleurone system is mainly at the level          of gene transcription.  The proposed research will investigate specific         interactions between specific protein factors with regulatory regions           (promoters) of hormone-regulated genes in the barley-aleurone system.           Goal for this research include:  (1) determination of specific DNA              sequences in the alpha-amylase promoters that interact with protein             factors, (2) investigation of the effect of hormonal treatments on the          activity of the protein factors, (3) determination of the importance of         promoter sequences inside the aleurone cells and (4) investigation of           the activity of these factors in genetic mutants with altered                   sensitivities to GA and ABA.  Results from this research should improve         our understanding of the primary action of GA and ABA, thus revealing           new insights into the signal transduction pathway governing hormonal            regulation of gene expression in plants.",
