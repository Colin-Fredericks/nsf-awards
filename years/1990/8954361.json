 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twelve geology educators are meeting for two weeks to learn about               geological applications of fractal geometry.  The workshops                     concentrate on six fractal analysis techniques that are relatively              simple to learn and apply, so that the techniques may, in turn, be used         in undergraduate class exercises and provide a basis for small-scale,           but productive undergraduate research projects.  The educators receive          lectures on fractal geometry and fractal analysis techniques, and read          and discuss recent papers that present geological research applications         of the techniques.  In addition, they also develop and carry out                individual research projects applying fractal analysis in their areas           of teaching and research interest, with the help of the University's            Intergraph system, a state-of-the-art facility for geometric data               acquisition, analysis and graphics.  Mainframe or PC software versions          of fractal analysis programs, along with a semiannual newsletter,               support participants' applications at their home institutions.                                                                                                  The home institutions of the faculty participants, as well as the host          university, are contributing to the cost of the program at an amount            approximately equal to 20% of the costs.",
