 "awd_abstract_narration": "The US-USSR Agreement on Cooperation in the Field Environmental                 Protection has had several sustained Arctic activities since its                beginning in 1972.  Area V deals with Biosphere Reserves and                    specific projects on northern wildlife, marine resources, and                   plants.  Five projects under Area X, Arctic and Subarctic                       Ecosystems, were formally agreed to at the January 1990 US-USSR                 Joint Committee meeting in Washington D.C.  These include                       protection of the environment under oil and gas development,                    regional planning, ecological and cultural monitoring, cryospheric              processes, and joint activities adjacent to the Bering Sea.  This               Interagency Agreement will facilitate exchange of personnel during              1990 under Areas V and X of the Agreement.  These activities deal               with Alaska, the Soviet Far East and Siberia.  A Soviet group will              visit Alaska in June to exchange information on environmental and               operational practices associated with gas and oil developments.                 And several small teams of scientists will participate in field                 investigations including visits in the Noatak Biosphere Reserve,                Alaska, and Taimyr Peninsula, Siberia.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife              Service will be responsible for the technical administration of the             joint activities.  The Arctic Staff of the Division of Polar                    Programs co-chairs Area X with the U.S. Geological Survey.  Soviet              groups include several Institutes of the Academy of Science, Gas                Ministry, and the State Committee for Nature Protection.  The U.S.              interagency cooperation fulfills U.S. Arctic Research Policy                    developed under the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, to                  pursue mutually beneficial international activities.  It also                   fulfills a growing concern to protect the Arctic environment.",
