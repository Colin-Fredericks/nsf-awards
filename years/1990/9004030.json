 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mitochondria, whether in lower or higher eukaryotes, are                        endowed with the capability to translate a small number of                      proteins encoded by their genomes.  With the exception of the                   transfer and ribosomal RNAs, and a single ribosomal protein,                    whose genes are located in mitochondrial DNA, all other                         components of the translational machinery are derived from                      nuclear genes.  During the past grant period, nuclear respiratory               deficient mutants of yeast affected in various aspects of                       mitochondrial metabolism have been isolated and characterized.                  Among this collection, approximately 55 complementation groups                  have been ascertained to be impaired in mitochondrial protein                   synthesis.  This subset of mutants has allowed characterization                 of different mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomal                proteins, and translational initiation and elongation factions.                 The analysis of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes have been                   particularly fruitful in revealing new and unsuspected                          evolutionary relationships between different members of this                    enzyme family.The studies embodied in the present proposal will                 provide addition insights into the nature of the mitochondrial                  translation system through continued biochemical and genetic                    analyses of respiratory deficient yeast mutants.  Several                       objectives will be pursued in the course of these investigations.               First, the PI intends to complete the characterization of other                 mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and to start                           structural studies on the lysyl-tRNA synthetase.  This                          information will be used to further assess the evolutionary                     derivation of this multigene family.  A second important goal is                to delineate the factors responsible for regulating the                         expression of mitochondrial synthetases and to clarify the                      biochemical rationale for the existence of separate genes for                   some of the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic homologues.  Finally                  they expect to work out an in vitro system of mitochondrial                     protein synthesis which will permit more incisive studies on the                mechanism by which the products of nuclear genes such as CBP6,                  CBP7 (CBS2), and CBS1 facilitate translation of the cytochrome b                mRNA and pre-mRNA.",
