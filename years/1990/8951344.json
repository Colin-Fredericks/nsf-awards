 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurement of microwave circuits in the range 0.1 to 18 GHz                    requires, as a minimum, a sweepable signal source and a scaler                  signal analyzer.  A low-cost microwave measurement station is                   developed using widely-available personal computers and recent                  advances in broadband microwave measurement components.  Costs                  will also be reduced by using a signal sweeper to run four or more              setups simultaneously.  The stations will not have the accuracy of              commercially available systems but will be well-suited to a                     teaching environment.  An emphasis will be placed on making the                 systems simple to allow students to better understand the                       measurement process.  The stations are interfaced directly to                   personal computers so the students can compare their measurements               with predicted circuit designs.  By making the software and                     hardware flexible enough to run with most microwave sweepers and                by using only off-the-shelf components, we plan to develop a                    complete laboratory course that can be adopted in teaching                      programs nationally.",
