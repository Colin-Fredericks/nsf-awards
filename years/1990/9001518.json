 "awd_abstract_narration": "Block copolymers are of great technological importance and                      simultaneously provide interesting opportunities to study basic                 statistical effects in physical science.  Although some aspects                 of the science of these copolymers are reasonably well                          understood, very little is known about their behavior when                      dissolved in binary liquid solvents or when they occupy the                     interface between two immiscible liquids, each of which is a good               solvent for one block of the copolymer.  A series of experiments                will be carried out on diblock and alternating copolymers                       dissolved in liquid mixtures to determine the effect of the                     polymer on:  1) the thermodynamics and capillary wave spectrum of               the liquid-liquid interface, 2) interfacial development under                   mechanically driven interfacial instabilities, and 3) composition               fluctuations in miscible liquid mixtures.  In all three cases,                  the liquid behavior is expected to affect the polymer                           conformation at the same time as the polymeric degrees of freedom               are affecting the interface(s), and the measurements will be                    directed toward understanding this behavior.",
