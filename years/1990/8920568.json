 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few political analysts would disagree with the statement that                   economic conditions are important to voters.  How the economy fares,            to one degree or another, determines whether members of the                     electorate will support the reelection bid of the governing party (or           parties).                                                                                                                                                       In this Doctoral Dissertation Research Support project the                      investigator begins with the premise that economic conditions                   influence support for elected officials.  What distinguishes this               study from previous research is the assumption that voters judge the            state of the economy primarily in local terms.  What matters to the             voters of Liverpool, England, is economic conditions in Liverpool.              Prior studies have assumed that what matters to voters in places such           as Liverpool is the state of the British economy.                                                                                                               This investigation analyzes the effects of both national and local              economic conditions on support for governing parties in Western                 Europe in national and subnational elections.  Since voters get                 information about the economy in two ways, personal experience and              from opinion makers, this study will provide new insights into where            voters get their information.  If, as the researcher assumes, the               local economy matters, the study adds weight to the argument that               voters learn about the economy through personal experience and not              just via reports in the evening newspaper or on the local telecast.             Thus, the study should provide information not only about whether or            not the local economy matters, but also about how the local economy             matters.  Does it matter only for local and regional elections?  Or             does it matter for national elections as well?                                                                                                                  The results of this investigation will be of interest to social                 scientists and analysts far removed from political science.                     Economists will be interested in how the public forms economic                  judgments.  Sociologists will appreciate the explicit role which the            general level of economic and social development play in this study.            Political actors will also have reason to take note of the                      conclusions of this study.  If local economic conditions count,                 political parties and elected officials gain leverage in their own              reelection attempts.  Local economic conditions are more easily                 adjusted for short-term political gain than national economic                   conditions.",
