 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to examine the effects of some promising                         structural variations on the adsorption of surfactants such as                  xylene sulfonates, ethoxylated sulfonates, and ethoxylated                      alcohols.  Fluorescence, electron spin resonance, resonance                     Raman and NMR spectroscopy will be used to characterize the                     microstructure of the absorbed layers and calorimetry for                       fundamental thermodynamic information on the absorption of                      these surfactants.  The adsorption of mixtures of these                         surfactants as well as mixtures with nonionic ethoxylated                       alcohols on solids will be investigated in detail using these                   techniques in conjunction with surface tension, electrokinetic                  and wettability measurements.  This comprehensive approach                      should shed new light on interactions between surfactants                       during their absorption as well as self-association and                         orientation during packing at interfaces and help to identify                   optimum surfactant structure and system conditions for                          different processes.",
