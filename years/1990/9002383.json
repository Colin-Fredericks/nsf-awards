 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal deals with a novel separation process recently                    developed that could add a valuable and powerful tool to the                    process designer.  It is concerned with multistage                              countercurrent separation processes.  The basic idea                            underlying the approach is based on using pairs of solvents                     that have a critical point of miscibility.  By operating close                                                                                                  to the critical point and changing the temperature of the                       system, one can alternatively create regions where the two                      solvents form homogeneous solution and others in which they                     separate into two distinct phases.                                                                                                                              Such solvents are already used in separations, but at present                   they are used far from the critical point of miscibility.  By                   operating across the critical point in each section, the mass                   transfer in the mixing zone as well as the coalescence process                                                                                                  is facilitated.  This allows design with low intensity of                       mixing, and this will be useful for separations in which there                                                                                                  is a tendency to emulsification or foaming due to impurities.                                                                                                   It is also suitable for separation of high molecular weight                     compound which have low diffusivities and therefore high mass                   transfer resistance.  This allows some novel design options                     and will allow separations which are at present not                             economically feasible with existing solvent separation                          methods.                                                                                                                                                        The basic concept has been demonstrated and a small column has                                                                                                  been successfully operated.  However, in order to apply these                   processes in an efficient way, a better understanding of the                    scientific principles involved is required.  The goal of this                   proposal is to provide understanding, as well as to provide a                   better scientific base for future design.",
