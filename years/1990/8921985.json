Pladziewicz will                   investigate the extent to which electron-transfer reactions of                  metalloproteins depend on the three-dimensional structure of                    the other reactant. Rates of electron transfer will be compared                 for metalloproteins reacting with optical isomers, i.e.,                        molecules which contain the same atoms connected in the same                    way, but which differ in their three-dimensional structures  so                 that they are non-superposable mirror images. The results of                    the project may help explain the exquisite selectivity                          exhibited by many biological electron-transfer reactions.                                                                                                       The principal objectives of the project are to: (1) Examine a                   series of electron-transfer reactions between metalloproteins                   and chiral coordination compounds with the expectation of                       identifying several reactions for which stereoselective                         electron transfer is detectable. (2) Measure the extent of                      stereoselectivity in these reactions. (3) Determine the extent                  to which stereoselective metalloprotein-coordination compound                   ion pairing in the precursor complex contributes to any                         observed electron-transfer stereoselectivity. (4) Determine the                 extent to which donor-acceptor distance and orientaion play a                   role in observed stereoselectivity. (5) Develop models based on                 available x-ray crystallographic data and observed selectivity                  to advance understanding of the stereochemical control of                       biological electron transfer.",
