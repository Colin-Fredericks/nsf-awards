 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the role of                             solution chemistry, chemical characteristics of the solid-                      solution interface and colloidal interactions with porous                       media on the transport of colloids in groundwater.                              Objectives of this project are to develop a theoretical                         framework for these phenomena and then to conduct                               laboratory experiments to evaluate the chemical factors                         that affect movement of colloids in porous media aquifers.                      The approach planned in developing the transport model                          will be to combine fundamental theories of mass transfer,                       consideration of the hydrodynamics of colloids in porous                        media, colloidal interaction and stability.                                                                                                                     The proposal leading to this award was submitted in accord                      with the NSF Program Announcement:  Research Initiation                         Awards, NSF 88-99.  Results are expected to provide a                           scientific base for characterizing the fate of colloidal                        particles that are suspended in water as they move through                      a porous medium such as a groundwater aquifer or a                              filtration process in a water treatment system.  In                             addition to their role as pollutants, colloidal particles                       can serve as the vehicle for transport of bacteria and                          viruses.  Results of this research may also be applied to                       engineering design of systems to isolate aquifers from                          potential contamination by seepage from hazardous waste                         disposal sites.",
