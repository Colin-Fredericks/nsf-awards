 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main purpose of this work is to study a direct effect of low                levels of visible light on mammalian cerebral cortical tissue.                  This project is based on the original observation that light                    enhances release of a neurotransmitter molecule (gamma-                         aminobutyric acid, GABA) from excised tissue.  Since the levels                 of light necessary for this response are estimated to penetrate                 through the top of the head, light may affect mammalian brain                   tissue while it is still in the body.  The overall or long-term                 objective in the project is clarifying the relevance of responses               to light penetrating the body in the living state.  More                        immediately, the objectives are aimed at examining how light may                have functional effects by: 1) establishing first to what extent                the most fundamental measure of function, glucose metabolism, is                affected by light in surface brain tissue, and then 2) focusing                 on the photosensitive molecule(s) which will further delineate                  what cellular processes/functions can be candidates for the                     physiological consequences of light.",
