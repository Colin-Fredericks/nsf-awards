Performance assessment tasks in science and math will be examined for           their potential in assessing computer competence, computer literacy, and        other computer-related skills.  The proposed project will include a             meeting of specialists in performance assessments, especially in science        and mathematics, as well as specialists in educational computing.  The          outcomes of this meeting will be formulated into general recommendations        for the assessment community, as well as specific recommendations for           the IEA (International Association for the Evaluation of Educational            Achievement) Computers in Education Study meeting in October, 1990.",
