 "awd_abstract_narration": "WISCNet, comprising all twenty-six institutions of the                        University of Wisconsin System and eight private colleges and                   universities in Wisconsin (Beloit College, Carroll College,                     Edgewood College, Lawrence University, Marquette University,                    Medical College of Wisconsin, Ripon College, and  St. Norbert                   College), will develop a consistent UW System-wide and statewide                architecture for national network access and will provide a                     structure for general access to the Internet.  Additionally, a                  higher quality communications system will be fostered by                        providing network-wide management and information services                      through the WISCNet management enterprize.                                                                                                                        WISCNet as such, will minimize isolation of scholars at                       Wisconsin instituions and allow these intitutions to attract                    quality faculty accustomed to national electronic communication.                It will also facilitate access to national networks and their                   services, including supercomputing resources and large database                 access.                                                                                                                                                           The grant will cover costs of gateway/routing equipment for all               the schools and partially defray the cost of communication lines                for the 36 month duration of the project.  The midlevel network,                CICNET, will provide high speed access to the midlevel and                      national backbone networks.  The University of Wisconsin, Madison               will provide necessary support and technical expertise for the                  operation and maintenance of the gateway nodes on all the                       campuses as well as information services for the users at the                   member institutions.",
