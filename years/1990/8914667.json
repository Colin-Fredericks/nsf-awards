The research                   agenda includes:  Congram-Oriented Internet Protocol Design and                 specification of the congram-oriented protocol.  This protocol                  version will be especially designed to allow research and                       experimentation with different resource management algorithms and               congram mechanisms of VHSI.  Experimentation  with user congrams                and \"perpetual\" internet congrams for a given set of congram                    sources.  Prototype implementation of the congram-oriented                      internet  protocol in the Unix kernel on a workstation.  Resource               Management  Specification of resource management algorithms for                 connection less  LANs. Simulation of LAN access protocols and                   point-to-point WAN  protocols using a high-level simulation                     package. Simulation of  resource server functions to perform                    congram resource allocation,  usage monitoring and enforcement.                 Design of mechanisms to allow WAN  gateways to monitor the                      resource availability of information inside  the subnetwork and                 maintain consistent resource availability  information among                    other gateways on the subnetwork.High-speed  Gateway Architecture               High-level design of a two port ATM-FDDI  gateway, sufficient to                demonstrate feasibility of ideas central to  VHSI gateway                       architecture.",
