 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solvent-induced crystallization is a novel method for                           separating an inorganic solute from a concentrated aqueous                      solution which can provide an attractive low-energy                             alternative to conventional crystallization methods.                            Precipitation is initiated when an aqueous phase is extracted                   into the organic phase or the solvent dissolves in the aqueous                                                                                                  phase.  The resultant mother liquor, containing the solvent,                    water, and, residual solute, is then regenerated by                             temperature adjustment into two phase, a water phase for                        recycle, and a solvent phase.  The latter is further dried by                   re-equilibrating with a saturated aqueous phase thereby                         completing the regeneration cycle.  In addition, some solutes                   separate by virtue of their differing solubilities into                         immiscible phases which can be exploited to drive certain                       metathesis chemistries when one of the products is removed by                   extraction via the crystallization step.                                                                                                                        This work proposes to exploit these techniques by obtaining                     new experimental data for a variety of representative                           salt/solvent/water systems and to develop a molecular-                          thermodynamic model to correlate the data both new and                          previously published.  The results of this work will provide                    the framework for a family of economically attractive,                          industrial-scale separation processes.",
