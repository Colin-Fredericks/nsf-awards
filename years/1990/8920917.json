 "awd_abstract_narration": "The establishment of natural parks in eastern Africa provided              protected habitats for endangered wildlife but displaced thousands of           persons.  Despite criminal penalties, many residents of areas near the          parks now regularly move into parklands to gather firewood, graze               livestock, and hunt game.  This doctoral dissertation project will              explore the historical and geographical evolution of conflicts between          local residents and conservationists around Arusha National Park in             Tanzania.  Documentary and archival research, aerial photographic               interpretation, land-use surveys, and formal interviews will be used to         trace the historic roots of current conflicts, to identify how regional         patterns of land use affect the use of park resources, to determine how         different economic situations among nearby villages affects the use of          park resources, and to assess the degree to which illegal incursions            into the park are forms of political protest.                                        This project will provide valuable information about the specific          nature of land-use conflicts in the study region, and it will also              present more general insights into the ways in which conservation               policies affect local populations.  This project also will provide an           excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
