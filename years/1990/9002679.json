 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will study models of                 nonlinear elasticity that describe the behavior of elastic                      materials at moderate to large deformations.  In contrast to                    linear models nonlinear models usually require for their solution               more sophisticated types of mathematical analysis.  On the                      theoretical side the principal investigator will study the weak                 continuity of the Jacobian determinant and the choice of a space                of admissible deformations.  On the applied side he will study                  the stability of elastic composite materials such as foam rubber,               and he will analyze solid-solid phase transitions in elastic                    crystals.                                                                       A goodly number of everyday phenomena involving elastic materials               can be explained using what is called linear elasticity theory.                 This linear theory concerns the behavior of elastic materials in                response to small deformations.  However when the deformations                  are moderate to large in size the linear theory must be replaced                with a more complicated nonlinear theory.  A nonlinear theory is                also required if the material is a composite, such as foam rubber               or fibre-reinforced rubber.  With this award the principal                      investigator will use mathematical analysis to study models of                  nonlinear elastic materials.",
