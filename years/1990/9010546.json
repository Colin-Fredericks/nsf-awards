 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work will use genetic algorithms to solve two classes of                   optimization problems related to neural networks: (1) the                       optimization of weights in recurrent and feed forward neural                    networks and (2) the optimization of the connectivity of neural                 networks.  To establish a challenging criteria for measuring                    success, it will build and test large networks for radar signal                 pulse detection.  The use of genetic algorithms for defining                    neural network connectivity has emerged as an area of research                  only in the last year.  A genetic algorithm has been used to                    fefine network connectivities for small problems, producing nets                which learn much faster than standard \"fully-connected\" nets and                which are suprisingly consistent in the number of data                          presentations required for learning.  This work will extend the                 current approach by combining the genetic algorithm code for                    weight optimization with a variation on our current approach to                 optimizing the connectivity.  This combination should allow                     optimization of connectivity and weights simultaneously on large                problems.  Finally, the successful optimization of feed forward                 networks using genetic algorithms is significant because these                  algorithms make no assumptions about how the weights (parameters)               that the genetic algorithm is asked to evaluate are actually                    used.  It should be possible to applied the genetic algorithms                  directly to recurrent network optimization problems which tend to               have restrictive storage and computational requirements when                    trained with true gradient descent learning techniques.",
