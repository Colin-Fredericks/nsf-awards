Students for the first time will be allowed to                   become actively involved in all phases of the process of                        scientific inquiry in introductory biology laboratories.                        Students will use the computer to perform simulated investigative               projects.  Also, the computer will serve as an aid in formulating               hypotheses, data collection, analyses and communication of their                results to their peers when students work with living materials.                Students will begin to build a more realistic appreciation for                  the vital role of collaboration, communication and verification                 in research.  Their interest in course material should also grow                because they are taking a more active role in developing their                  own and peer learning materials.  The grantee is considerably                   overmatching the award from non-Federal sources.",
