 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports mathematical research on problems                    arising in the study of dynamical systems and differential                      equations.  The equations are functional differential equations                 of retarded type.  In certain equations occurring in biological                 models, the retardation of memory effect is a natural feature.                       Work will focus on four main topics.  The first concerns                   monotone flows on monotone dynamical systems.  Efforts to modify                standard systems theory to present a unified treatment of                       differential equations for which the set of equilibrium points                  contains all (phase space) constant functions will be made.  The                second topic relates to instability of physical systems.                        Applications of invariance principles of finite delay equations                 will be made to obtain instability results for finite and                       infinite delay functional differential equations.  Instability is               characterized by the property that all solutions passing near an                unstable point must leave every neighborhood of the point.                           Neutral functional differential equations make up the third                element of this project.  Work will be done in establishing                     comparison-convergence techniques for approximating solutions.                  The final goal of the research is that of using monotone                        iteration techniques to study periodic boundary value problems                  for functional differential equations.  Both the existence of                   periodic solutions and techniques for constructing them will be                 considered.",
