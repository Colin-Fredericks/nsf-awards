 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Schenectady County Community College project involved the                  enhancement of the chemistry laboratory curriculum by incorporating             more student hands-on use of computer-driven instruments for                    qualitative and quantitative experiments.  To accomplish this goal              the College proposed the acquisition of an FTIR spectrophotometer,              an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and two microcomputer                   systems.  These additions, along with existing instruments, allowed             for:  (1)  an increase in the number of student applications using              state-of-the-art instruments and microcomputers; (2)  an increase               in the diversity of the applications performed by students; (3)                 enhancement of the traditional techniques that students use for                 qualitative and quantitative analysis; (4) improvement of the                   state-of-the-art of the equipment that students encounter; (5)                  enhancement of student capabilities with computers; and (6)                     introduction of a new instrumental analysis course as an elective               for students.  The institution contributed to this project in an                amount equal to the NSF funds.",
