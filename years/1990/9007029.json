 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sampling will begin well down in what is believed to be the Peoria              Loess and continue all the way to the present land surface.  We                 should thereby include the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition,                the interval of post-glacial high temperature (the Altithermal or               Climatic Optimum), and the period of temperatures lower than                    present (the Neoglaciation, including the Little Ice Age).  We will             routinely collect samples from the lower, middle, and upper                     portions of each visually detectable geological or pedological                  unit, and take samples at intermediate levels of thick, apparently              massive units.  In this way data will be obtained for all                       variations of material, yet form a basis for statistical                        manipulation of analyses with depth if that becomes desirable.  All             samples will be subjected to routine soil characterization                      procedures such as determination of grain size, organic matter                  content, pH, carbonate content, bulk density, and cation exchange               capacity.  Carbon-nitrogen ratio, base saturation, and clay                     mineralogy may also prove useful for elucidation of variations in               climatic parameters.  The modern surface soil and all buried                    paleosols will be described according to standard soil survey                   criteria.  At least one monolith will be prepared and removed from              the face in order to preserve the stratigraphy for possible restudy             after the exposure has been eroded away.  Carbon from the organic-              rich horizons in the paleosols will yield a sequence of radiocarbon             dates to develop a firm chronologic framework for the proxy                     climatic data.  At least two radiocarbon dates will be obtained                 for each of the paleosols.",
