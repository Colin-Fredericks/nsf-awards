The meeting is to concentrate on quantum field theory,                          string theory and quantum gravity.  It is intended to take                      stock of recent developments in the field and appraise its                      present trends and future directions.  Among the themes to                      be focused on are:  String theory (3 sessions); Conformal                       field gravity (2 sessions); Topological properties of                           quantum field theory (2 sessions); and Quantum gravity and                      the cosmological constant (2 sessions).  Six days of                            lectures are planned, of five one hour lectures each day                        and seminars of shorter duration.  It is expected that                          about fifty scientists will participate including twenty                        from outside India.                                                                                                                                             Scope:  The topics covered in the meeting are among the                         most exciting in theoretical physics at present, the group                      of U.S. scientists to participate are well chosen to                            represent experienced, well established scientists as well                      as young promising post-doctoral fellows.  The                                  participation of U.S., physicists would contribute greatly                      to a growing interaction of Indian and U.S. scientists in                       the field.  The Indian host institute is a world class                          research organization fully suited for managing such an                         activity.",
