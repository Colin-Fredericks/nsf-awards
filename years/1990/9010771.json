 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal in robotics is the successful demonstration of mobile,             autonomous robots.  The computational power needed for sensory                  processing, planning, learning, and motion control is staggering.               Some of this need can be met by using special purpose devices, but              much computation is still needed for the higher level functions.                                                                                                A computer architecture for controlling an autonomous, mobile robot             must be flexible, have very high performance, and support real-time             execution.  Execution of the tasks can be organized into a hierarchy.           This project employs a hierarchical, MIMD parallel architecture for             this application.                                                                                                                                               The Hierarchical MultiProcessor consists of several levels; each level          is a group of microprocessors connected by two buses.  Communication            between processors is accomplished by message passing.  One of the              buses at each level is also used for communication between adjacent             levels.  Several novel techniques of improving the communication                efficiency in this architecture are presented.                                                                                                                  A major thrust in this project is to perform a detailed performance             analysis of the architecture and its variations.  The complexity of             the multiprocessor, multi-bus architecture, and of the real-time task           execution, presents formidable challenges for performance analysis.             Techniques for doing this analysis, are being developed.                                                                                                        The Robotics and Intelligent Systems Laboratory at N.C. State is in             the process of building a mobile, autonomous robot.  A reduced version          of the HMP architecture is being implemented, which will be followed            by a full-scale implementation.",
