 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will investigate hotspots and mid-oceanic ridges to                 constrain their underlying physical processes, mainly heat and                  mass transfer.  His investigation of hotspots has confirmed that                these features are produced by mantle plumes.  In particular, the               shape of hotspots swells, such as that hear Hawaii, is simply                   related to the kinematics of flow from plumes.  He has                          constrained the heat and mass fluxes of plumes globally.  He will               now extend this work to learn more about how plumes work and                    about the dynamics of heat transfer between the plume and the                   lithosphere.  Some variations in the mantle temperature beneath                 ridge axes may be related to ambient temperature variations at                  mid-mantle depths, not plumes.  His studies of ridge axes will                  concentrate on modeling features affected by temperature                        variations associated with hotspots, such as central rifts.  He                 will continue to study temperature variations associated with                   hydrothermal circulation with emphasis on the downwelling parts                 of the circulation nearest to the ridge axis.  He will reprocess                multichannel seismic data from the back-arc Valu Fa ridge near                  Tonga to constrain the location of the crustal magma chamber,                   including one line across an overlapping spreading center.",
