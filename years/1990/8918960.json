 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Kent Lightfoot, a group of graduate                   students will analyze materials collected in the initial phase of               the Fort Ross archaeological project.  They will also conduct                   related documentary research to prepare for a larger-scale field                project.  The Fort Ross site, located on the coast of California,               was established by Russia in 1812 (and maintained until 1841) as                a base for sea otter hunting.  It also served as an agricultural                station where crops and livestock were raised for local                         consumption and for shipment to Russia's Alaskan colonies. In                   addition to Europeans, the base contained Alaskan natives.                      Presumably both groups interacted with the Native American                      peoples who inhabited this coastal area.  Dr. Lightfoot and his                 team are focussing their attention on this interactive aspect and               have located a series of likely native American sites which both                pre and postdate the establishment of the Fort.                                                                                                                 Analyses will include obsidian hydration dating of lithic                       remains, processing and cataloging of artifacts, analysis of                    faunal and floral remains, and sediment studies.  Relevant                      ethnohistoric and archaeological sources will also be examined to               put these materials into a broader anthropological context and to               establish directions for future research.                                                                                                                       This research is significant for several reasons.  First,                       excellent ethnographic data exists on aboriginal California                     peoples, and archaeologists have used this information to                       reconstruct hypothetical prehistoric lifeways.  However, it is                  unclear how great the impact of Russians and other Europeans was                and some argue that aboriginal life was markedly changed by this                contact.  This project will help to answer this question.                       Secondly, the research will assist in the training of several                   young and extremely promising scientists.",
