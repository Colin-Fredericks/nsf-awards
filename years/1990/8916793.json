 "awd_abstract_narration": "The occurrence of multiple RNA polymerase specificity                           determinants (sigma factors) within a single organism represents                a powerful mechanism for gene control.  The substitution of one                 for another of these proteins on the core transcriptase could                   turn on or suppress a large number of genes by a single                         regulatory event.  At least nine unique sigma-like proteins are                 present in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.  Five of these                      proteins are present during vegetative growth while four of them                are found only during a simple form of differentiation                          (sporulation) that the bacterium undergoes as a consequence of                  nutritional stress.  We propose to investigate the function and                 regulation of two (sigma B, Sigma E) of these sigma factors.                    Sigma B and Sigma E differ in their abundance, time of appearance               during growth and development, and the method by which they                     participate in the activation of their respective regulons.  We                 will analyze the function of Sigma B as well as the factors which               influence its activity by characterizing by genetic and                         physiological means a collection of previously isolated mutations               which enhance transcription form a Sigma B-dependent promoter,                  map proximal to the Sigma B structural gene (sigB), and confer an               aberrant morphology on cells that carry them.  We will                          investigate the regions of the Sigma E structural gene (sigE)                   which influence its activity and synthesis by analyzing mutations               which alter these properties.  We will explore in depth the                     phenomenon of \"processing\" of Sigma E from an inactive precursor                molecule.  This will involve a \"suppression analysis\" of a                      number of mutations in elements of the \"processing machinery\" as                well as sigE itself.  The basis of the suppressions will be                     characterized genetically, immunologically and biochemically.",
