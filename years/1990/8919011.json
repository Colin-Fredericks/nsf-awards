 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Zimmerman has shown that somatic embryos of carrot which have               reached the globular stage of development exhibit both novel                    mechanisms of heat shock gene regulation and unusual                            physiological reactions to heat stress. Specifically, the                       regulation of heat shock gene expression transiently shifts from                the transcriptional to the translational level, and then shifts                 back again. Moveover, heat shock exposure of mid-globular embryos               results in the specific and irreversible arrest of development                  (no other embryo stage is so dramatically affected). In this                    proposal, she describes experiments which will extend these                     findings in an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms                    which are at work in this system and the relationship between                   this unusual heat shock gene regulation and the observed arrest                 of globular embryo development. She proposes to achieve four                    major objectives; 1) To understand the general mechanisms                       underlying the transcriptional repression and translational                     activation of heat shock gene expression during globular embryo                 development, 2) To characterize the DNA sequences of carrot heat                shock genes which respond to transcriptional and translational                  regulation both in suspension cells and during embryo                           development, 3) To elucidate the relationship between globular                  embryo thermotolerance and developmental arrest by heat shock,                  and 4) To characterize the heat shock response of globular                      embryos at the individual cell level.",
