 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Research award supports                            cooperative research in high-temperature alloys between                         Dr. David Douglass of UCLA and Dr. Fernando Rizzo of the                        Catholic University (PUC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The                       purpose of this research is to conduct a study of the                           internal oxidation of various Nb alloys over the range of                       1450-1900 C.  Internal oxidation of Nb alloys occurs during                     heat treatment in \"vacuum\" over a wide range of oxygen                          pressure, and may occur also during high-temperature exposure                   of missile components at low oxygen pressures.                                                                                                                  A program involving the internal oxidation of Nb alloys, both                   binary and commercial alloys, is underway at UCLA under                         Professor Douglass.  Some interesting preliminary results                       have been obtained to date over the temperature range of                        1450-1950C and over a low oxygen-pressure range.  This                          subject is an ideal one for collaborative research with                         Professor Rizzo.  He will use the EDX/SEM method to measure                     these profiles.  The data obtained will be analyzed in Brazil                   with his computer program to assess agreement between the                       experimental values and the calculated values.  Douglass will                   fabricate ternary alloys of Nb-Mo-Hf and Nb-Mo-Zr which will                    be internally oxidized.  The study of such alloys will enable                   control of internal oxidation to be shifted from the arrival                    and adsorption of oxygen on the surface to diffusion of                         oxygen in the substrate.",
