 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible                                     to liquefaction when subjected to strong                                        ground shaking, such as occurs during an                                        earthquake.  Liquefied soils experience a                                       decrease in bearing strength: this can lead                                     to the partial or total collapse of buildings                                   standing on liquefied soils.                                                                                                                                    The aim of this project is to verify the                                        analyses used to predict liquefaction due to                                    earthquake loading.  Since the field data                                       needed for this verification is extremely                                       difficult to obtain, data is being used                                         instead from laboratory experiments performed                                   on geotechnical centrifuges.  This is a                                         relatively new technique for soil testing                                       which is becoming well accepted in the                                          geotechnical research community.  The                                           technique for simulating earthquakes on                                         centrifuges is being developed, and the                                         results obtained have generated confidence in                                   the method: questions that remain to be                                         answered are being addressed in this study.                                                                                                                     Different geotechnical structures, including                                    sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and                                        embankments are being investigated so as to                                     validate the applicability of the                                               liquefaction analysis methods to a variety of                                   geotechnical structures.  Class A predictions                                   - which involve predicting the soil response                                    without knowing the measured results - are                                      used for later comparison with measured                                         results.                                                                                                                                                        The Earth Technology Corporation is                                             responsible for the management of the                                           project, for providing carefully calibrated                                     soil samples, for overseeing the testing                                        program, as well as being responsible for                                       receiving, distributing and documenting data,                                   in conjunction with the Adjudication                                            Committee.  It is also responsible for                                          managing the prediction studies.  The                                           Adjudication Committee acts as an independent                                   steering group.                                                                                                                                                 The participating institutions are the                                          University of California at Davis and                                           Berkeley, the California Institute of                                           Technology, the University of Colorado, the                                     Massachusetts Institute of Technology,                                          Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic                                    Institute, and Cambridge University, England.                                   Collectively, they are examining the                                            mechanisms of liquefaction, the development                                     and verification of analytical and numerical                                    models, soil-structure interaction for                                          conditions of limited and large deformations,                                   and the effect of interfaces between soil                                       layers of differing permeabilities.                                                                                                                             This study will contribute significantly to                                     improving the understanding of the soil                                         liquefaction phenomenon, and to the                                             reliability of methods used to predict the                                      occurrence of liquefaction and the resulting                                    damage to structures.
