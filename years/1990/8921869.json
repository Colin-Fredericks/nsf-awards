 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sixth International Conference of Archaeozoology (ICAZ) will                be held in Washington, DC on May 21-25, 1990.  To date, over 400                individuals have expressed interest in attending and most plan to               present papers.  This National Science Foundation will provide                  travel and subsistence expenses for a minimum of 20 participants.                                                                                               Archaeozoology is a discipline concerned with the analysis and                  interpretation of zoological remains from archaeological sites.                 Analysis of such fauna provides several kinds of crucial                        information to archaeologists.  It provides insight into the diet               of different prehistoric groups.  As complex societies such as                  states develop, faunal remains yield crucial data on the                        development of economic and market systems and the centralization               of political authority.  They also shed light on prehistoric                    hunting and herding strategies and how these developed over time.               Finally, analysis of faunal remains provides importance evidence                on past climates and environments and how they were affected by                 human groups.                                                                                                                                                   Because archaeozoology is a broad intellectual field with many                  practitioners in both the Old and New Worlds, communication is                  extremely important.  The ICAZ conferences have offered an very                 successful way to meet this need, and the Washington meeting                    should prove no exception.  NSF support will assure that the most               important papers will be presented.  American science will                      benefit because U.S. researchers will be exposed to the most                    significant work now carried out in other parts of the world.",
