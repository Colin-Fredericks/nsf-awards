 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuation of research dealing with the distribution and               genesis of PGE and the Babbitt Cu-Ni deposit, Duluth Complex                    Minnesota, is proposed.  Our preliminary results indicate that                  throughout the basal zone mineralization at Babbitt, Ir, Os, Ru,                Rh, and Re have behaved as relatively immobile elements, and                    their distribution is related to primary magmatic processes.  Pt                and Pd show very different behavior, exhibiting poor correlations               with Cu and S, and strong evidence of remobilization.  A PGE-                   enriched zone has been detected which is spatially removed from                 the area of highest grade Cu-Ni ore, and is characterized by                    anomalous @34S values, and sulfide-oxide mineralogy.  Synchrotron               X-ray microprobe studies reveal ppm quantities of Pd in copper                  minerals from high bulk Pd samples, and Pd-enrichment in                        mackinawite produced during hydrothermal alteration.  Detailed                  studies of bulk rock and mineral chemistry, alteration reactions,               and S, H, and O isotopes are proposed to delineate the                          relationship between the PGE-enriched zone and the remainder of                 basal zone mineralization.  Microsampling of individual sulfide                 minerals will be pursued using laser ablation-mass spectrometry                 (@34S values) and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microprobe                     techniques (PGE values).  Progressive changes in the chemical and               isotopic measurements.  The possible involvement of an                          externally-derived fluid in PGE localization will also be                       investigated.",
