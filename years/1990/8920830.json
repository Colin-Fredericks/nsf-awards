 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will involve experimental and theoretical studies of               transient multiwave mixings in thin structures of highly nonlinear              materials.  The principal materials to be used in the experiments are           liquid crystals, but some studies will also be extended to                      semiconductor materials to further establish the generality of the              theories and observations.  In these media, recent theories and                 experiments by the principal investigators have demonstrated that many          useful multiwave mixing effects can occur efficiently in the                    stationary regime as well as in the transient regimes.  The proposed            studies will delve into several fundamentally interesting and                   important aspects of these effects, especially in the transient                 regime.  These include:  the roles played by intense temporal and               spatial self- and mutual-phase modulations/shifts and side                      diffractions that invariably accompany efficient wave mixing in highly          nonlinear thin materials; the interrelationship between the phase               modulation effects and other geometrical/optical/material parameters            such as the laser pulse width and intensities, material response time           and nonlinearity (electronic, thermal, orientational, local or                  diffusive, etc.) the interaction length, wave mixing angle, anisotropy          and birefringence, polarization, temperature, etc.  This program of             research will result in new fundamental measurements and theoretical            formalisms for quantitative descriptions of, and application                    guidelines for, a broad new class of nonlinear devices including beam           and image amplifiers, beam combining and steering, phase conjugator             and self-pumped oscillators, based on coherent multiple wave mixing             effects.",
