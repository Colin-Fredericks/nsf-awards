 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI seeks support for an investigation of a novel theory                to investigate the role of the hippocampus in learning and                      memory.  Specifically, that the hippocampal formation provides                  the neural substrates that enables an animal to construct a                     representation of the joint occurance of two or more stimulus                   elements.  An important point of this theory is that it allows                  the explanation of how animals can solve problems that require                  non-linear solutions.  In another words, it allows animals to                   solve problems that cannot be solved by a learning system that                  simply algebraically sums the associative strengths of the                      individual cues that compose a stimulus.  This is an interesting                proposal by an innovative and highly productive investigator.                   The proposed research is a gamble and there is a minimum of                     preliminary data to allow an easy judgement.  However, the                      investigator has made excellent progress and is now at a stage of               his research where a definitive decision on the validity of the                 configural association theory can be made.  The potential for a                 significant outcome seems sufficient to justify the risk.  This                 work has the potential to move behavioral neuroscience                          significantly closer to an understanding of the neural systems                  that underlie learning and memory.",
