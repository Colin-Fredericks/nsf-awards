 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Vaughn Bryant, Ms. Kristin Sobolik                   will analyze archaeological materials and comparative samples                   which will provide the basis for her doctoral dissertation.  The                project focuses on the subsistence adaptation of Archaic peoples,               early hunters and gatherers, who lived in the Lower Pecos Region                (Texas) of the Chihuahuan Desert.  It utilizes two approaches.                  Ms. Sobolik will visit this research area in each of the four                   major seasons and conduct biological surveys to determine the                   types and the densities of resources available.  She will also                  collect samples which will provide a comparative base for the                   identification of archaeological materials.  Secondly, she will                 examine archaeological remains, stored at the Texas                             Archaeological Research Laboratories in Austin, from a number of                Pecos sites.  She will combine the results of faunal, floral, and               coprolite analyses with data drawn from skeletal studies of                     prehistoric inhabitants to delineate Archaic subsistence patterns               and draw inferences about paleodiet.                                                                                                                            The archaeological sites in the Lower Pecos region are of                       interest for several reasons.  First, although a large number                   have been carefully excavated over the last several decades, much               of the material has not been analyzed.  This is unfortunate                     because in this desert region preservation is excellent.  Plant                 remains which can serve both to reconstruct diet and environment                are abundant and such situations are rare.  The archaeology of                  the region is also important because the long prehistoric record                documents how technologically simple populations adapted to and                 survived in a harsh and variable desert environment.  Ms.                       Sobolik's research will synthesize a broad range of data from a                 number of sites.                                                                                                                                                This project is important for several other reasons as well.                    Methodologically it is valuable because it explores how very                    diverse data sets may be drawn together and analyzed to yield                   nutritional information.  If successful it will provide a model                 which may be applied in other regions of the world.  The work                   will also assist in the training of an extremely promising young                scientist.",
