 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done during the period of this award will focus                 on higher dimensional inverse scattering problems and on related                one dimensional problems.  The underlying idea for work of this                 nature is that of constructing obstacles from data measured as                  particles pass the obstacle.  The transition from the future of a               solution of, say, the wave equation, to the past is called the                  scattering transform.  Knowledge of either the transform or its                 spectrum is considered to be central to understanding any wave or               generalized wave which experiences scattering.                                       This work will consider extending results on time dependent                Schrodinger equations with slowly decaying potentials in which                  the inverse equation admits simple poles.  In higher dimensional                settings the advent of multiple poles cannot be ruled  out.                     However, their structure is not understood.  The question  of                   whether or not they may accumulate will also be studied.                        One method to be used will consider solutions for time                          dependent Schrodinger equations which are not necessarily bounded               in time.  This method has been used to achieve the complete                     solution (for all potentials) for the one dimensional nxn inverse               scattering problem as well as for the one dimensional n-th order                scalar equation.  Several classical equations and systems are                   expected to be analyzed using results developed through this                    investigation.  They include the Zakharov-Shabat system and the                 KPI equation.",
