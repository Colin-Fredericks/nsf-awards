 "awd_abstract_narration": "Appeals to optimality have a prominent role in philosophy,                      cognitive science, and evolutionary biology.  Optimizing                        procedures have been challenged as excessively demanding, and                   Herbert Simon has proposed an alternative analysis in terms                     of what he terms \"satisficing.\"  It has become common to view                   satisficing as optimizing under additional constraints.  Dr.                    Richardson is undertaking research that challenges this                         reduction of satisficing to optimizing, and examines the                        implications of this result of evolutionary ecology and                         cognitive science.  There are three components to the project.                  The first phase incorporates a general characterization of                      satisficing models and the conditions under which they differ                   procedurally from optimization models.  Second, optimization                    models purport to provide an independent measure of fitness,                    but have been criticized on the grounds that the measure they                   provide is not both operational and general.  In light of the                   general characterization of satisficing models, the problem                     in this second phase of the project is whether satisficing                      models are likely to resolve methodological problems                            confronting optimality models in evolutionary biology.  The                     final phase is a preliminary examination of the merits of non-                  optimizing models in cognitive science, and, in particular,                     their implications for philosophy of science.",
