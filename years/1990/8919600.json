 "awd_abstract_narration": "The great British ornithologist David Lack proposed a                    hypothesis to explain the evolution of the number and the size of               eggs laid in a clutch by a female bird.  He proposed that                       evolution will favor females that lay intermediate sized eggs and               clutches.  Females that lay many small eggs will start with more                offspring, but these offspring will be small and may have a low                 chance of survival. Females that lay few large eggs increase                    survival chances of their offspring, but start with fewer of                    them.  Thus females that lay an intermediate number and size of                 eggs are likely to have the most surviving offspring.                                The investigators have developed the first experimental test               of Lack's Hypothesis as it applies to egg size in lizards.  They                will release hatchlings from clutches with large versus small                   eggs, and then monitor their survivorship and age to first                      reproduction.  Using novel techniques, they can produce \"giant\"                 and \"miniaturized\" hatchlings that enable them to control                       hatchling size independent of genotype.  Thus, they will                        determine actual patterns of selection on egg size.                                  These studies not only test a fundamental issue in                         evolutionary ecology, but also have important practical                         implications as well.  Captive breeding programs (salmon, trout,                sea turtles) have ignored the importance of egg size on future                  survivorship.  These experiments will show whether that is wise                 and whether those breeding protocols require revision.",
