 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anoxic, varved sediments are accumulating along the margins of                  the Gulf of California at especially high rates.  The temporal                  and spatial distribution of these sediments remains to be                       determined, and consequently a full understanding of their                      origin is uncertain.  Dr. Karlin has studied the geochemical                    and paleomagnetic character of these materials at DSDP Site                     480.  The present award is to resample this Site and to                         participate on a coring cruise in June '90 to augment this data                 set.  He has five objectives: 1) refine the paleomagnetic time                  scale at Site 480, calibrating to a delta O18 record that will                  be measured at WHOI, and to an automated varve-counting                         technique in collaboration with similar work by A. Soutar                       (Scripps) on box cores to be collected in June;  2) reconstruct                 the last 250 Kyrs of productivity, ocean circulation , and                      continental climate from XRF and LECO geochemical analyses from                 Site 480;  3) examine the last 20Kyrs of paleomagnetic secular                  variation recorded in the upcoming piston cores, dating with                    AMS C14, delta O18 and varve counting;  4) combine rock                         magnetic, sedimentological and geochemical studies to evaluate                  the effects of diagenesis upon the fidelity of paleomagnetic                    signals recorded in rapidly deposited sediments;  and 5) use                    similar rock magnetic and geochemical analyses to characterize                  the last 20Kyrs of spatial and temporal variations in                           productivity and terrigenous input to the Gulf of California.",
