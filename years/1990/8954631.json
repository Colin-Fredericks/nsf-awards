 "awd_abstract_narration": "While elementary school teachers want their students to be                      better mathematical thinkers, their own teaching styles too                     often inhibit reflection and interpretation.  The goal of the                   proposed project is to generate more and better mathematical                    discourse in elementary classrooms by helping teachers talk                     mathematics with their students.  Over the course of this                       eighteen month project, Technical Education Research Centers                    will work with mathematicians, mathematics educators, and 10-12                 teachers from several school districts to identify the                          difficulties teachers experience in discussing mathematics.  A                  core group of teachers and TERC staff will collaborate to                       develop, implement and reflect on effective models of                           mathematical discourse.  By the end of the project, they will                   have:  developed, implemented, and documented, promising                        approaches to supporting substantive mathematical discussions                   in elementary classrooms; analyzed the results of these                         approaches on teacher development and student/teacher                           discourse; captured classroom episodes of mathematical                          discourse on videotape; and developed recommendations for                       constructing teacher training materials.",
