 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most                       powerful tool available to the chemist for the elucidation of                   the structure of molecules.  It is used to identify unknown                     substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within                  molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between                    molecules in solution.  Access to state-of-the-art NMR                          spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out                      frontier research.                                                                                                                                              This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Chemistry Department of the RUI institution,                      Franklin & Marshall College, to acquire, operate and maintain a                 high-field NMR spectrometer.  The acquisition of the instrument                 will enhance the ability of the Department to prepare                           undergraduates for possible careers in chemistry and will                       enhance research in the following areas:                                                                                                                        a)  The determination of equilibrium constants, stoichiometry,                      and structures of Lewis adducts of model organometallic                         halides of Groups 14 and 15                                                                                                                                 b)  The determination of the structural determinants of                             organometallic tautomerism and higher coordination                                                                                                          c)  Thermal rearrangements of bicyclic vinylcyclobutances and                       stereoselective syntheses of substituted norbornanones and                      norbornenones and,                                                                                                                                          d)  Investigations of infrared laser-induced organic reactions.                     The instrument will also be used in ongoing collaborative                       projects with neighboring institutuions such as the                             determination of substituent effects in phosphineborane                         organometallics.",
