 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regenerative engine is a new concept of internal                            combustion engine in which part of the energy of the exhaust                    gases is recovered in a porous regenerator to be used in the                    next cycle.  As a result, the thermodynamic cycle in the                        engine is radically changed.  A computational model, including                  fluid friction as well as thermodynamic variables, has shown                    indicated efficiencies in excess of 40 percent for wide                         ranges of fuel/air mixture ratios, speeds, loads, and design                    parameters.  This engine also promises a reduction of pollutant                 emissions and a higher power density through the elimination of                 knock.  It is proposed to test experimentally this cycle in order               to check the appropriateness of the model and the practical                     potential of the new cycle.  Conventional engine tests (load,                   speed, fuel consumption, and emissions) will be performed over                  a prototype engine composed of two single-cylinder engines.                     In this engine, one cylinder acts as a compressor and the                       other as an expander with a variable phase difference between                   them.  Flow is controlled by a series of poppet valves.                                                                                                         Experimental indicated cycles will be obtained for comparison                   with the predictions of the model and its further                               improvement.  Heat transfer and combustion sub-models will be                   added as experimental data become available.",
