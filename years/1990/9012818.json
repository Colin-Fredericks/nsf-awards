 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most widely used methods of high-resolution marine                          stratigraphy rely on the record of changes in delta-018,                        paleontology or paleomagnetics.  Unfortunately, these techniques                are limited to sediments either rich in carbonate- or silica-                   bearing fossils, or from magnetically oriented cores.  Dr.                      Herbert will develop techniques for using GRAPE (Gamma Ray                      Attenuation Porosity Evaluator) bulk density measurements to                    identify orbital frequencies in 5 DSDP and ODP cores from the                   equatorial eastern Pacific.  These \"Milankovitch\" signals are                   known within 2% precision back through the Neogene, and the                     author intends to \"tune\" the sedimentation rates to fit these                   frequencies.  Preliminary work has shaon that a \"moving window\"                 scheme will result in 5% precision and 100 Kyr resolution of                    sedimentation rates back to 17 MY.  As this is a developmental                  experiment, he proposes several validation checks against                       existing biostratigraphy and paleomagnetic calibrations, as well                as inter-site consistency checks.  If found to be valid, this                   technique will not only provide much improved chronologies at                   these and other cores, but will also:  1) make possible equally                 improved mass accumulation rate estimates for CaCO3, Corg, SiO2,                and aeolian dust;  2) provide the first chance of finding                       paleoceanographic periodicities longer than 500 Kyrs;  and 3)                   lead to better understanding of the mean and variance of orbital                forcings back to 17 MY.",
