 "awd_abstract_narration": "The late Iron Age site of Kelheim, located at the confluence of                 the Altmuhl and Danube rivers in Bavaria, Germany, covers an area               of approximately 600 hectares of land and is enclosed by a wall                 about 3300 meters long.  It provides mute testimony to the size                 and complexity of European \"cities\" which existed before Julius                 Caesar and his Roman legions marched northward and conquered                    large portions of Western Europe.  While archaeologists have                    known for some time that such indigenous sites existed little is                understood about how they developed and functioned.  This                       project, under the direction of Dr. Peter Wells, will shed new                  light on this process.                                                                                                                                          Following a preliminary season of excavation, Dr. Wells and his                 colleagues will now conduct an additional two field seasons of                  work at Kelheim.  They will open broad horizontal areas to expose               structural and artifactual remains.  They will analyze the                      artifacts they recover, as well as associated floral and faunal                 materials.  Large heaps of iron slag indicate that large scale                  metal production was carried out, and the team's research will                  also focus on this.  Slag and iron samples will be collected and                subjected to laboratory analysis to provide insight into the                    manufacturing process.  Archaeologists wish to know how these                   early sites were organized and the extent to which a strong                     central authority existed.  By examination of the spatial                       distribution of activities across the site as well as the degree                of standardization of manufactured remains, this question can be                addressed.                                                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons.  It will provide                additional information on a little-understood aspect of European                prehistory.  It will shed new light on how complex societies such               as our own first arose and were maintained.  Finally, it will                   contribute to the training of several graduate students.",
