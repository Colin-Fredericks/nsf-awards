 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to distinguish species of marine microorganisms                (bacteria protozoans, fungi and microalgae) is a major problem in               understanding the processes of primary production and organic                   recycling.  Developments in molecular biology are providing an                  array of tools to genetically characterize and quantify marine                  microbes.  The first step in applying these techniques to                       problems in biological oceanography is to develop species-                      specific genetic markers.                                                            There has been extensive study on the 5S, small (SSU) and                  large (LSU) subunits of ribosomal RNA (rRNA).  Studies of                       conserved regions of rRNA, which evolve slowly, have been                       instrumental in developing phylogenetic lines of evolution.  In                 addition to conserved regions, there are variable regions in LSU                that evolve rapidly.  Initial investigations, in Dr. Fell's                     laboratory and elsewhere, suggest that nucleotide sequences in                  the variable regions are sufficiently conserved to distinguish                  organisms at the level of species and genus.                                         This research will amplify preliminary studies of the                      variable regions of LSU rRNA using marine yeasts as a model for                 other marine eukaryotes.  The yeasts are uniquely appropriate as                they can be grown in culture and their nucleotide sequences can                 be compared with known mating genetic markers.  Nucleotide                      sequencing will use the established techniques of Sanger and                    Lane.  Recognition of nucleotide sequences that are species                     specific, in combination with techniques such as the polymerase                 chain reaction and the use of molecular probes and                              hybridizations, provide powerful tools for the amplification of                 nucleic acids and the identification and quantification of marine               microorganisms from single cell material.",
