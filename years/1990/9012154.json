 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropologists tend to overlook the New World monkeys                     because they are not on the main line of relationship to humans.                Nevertheless, they comprise an exciting side branch which                       provides anthropologists with examples parallel to changes which                have taken place in the catarrhine fossil record.  The history of               New World monkeys is still poorly known, compared with that of                  other major radiations of higher primates in the eastern                        hemisphere, and phylogenetic relationships among the relatively                 distinct groups of platyrrhine fossils are largely unresolved.                  Until very recently, the entire fossil record for platyrrhines                  consisted of remains of fewer than thirty individuals.  During                  the past four years, paleontological research in Colombia and                   Argentina has yielded an abundance of new fossils that may be                   very important in sorting out these relationships.  Further                     systematic and functional studies of new Argentine fossils will                 help clarify relationships among modern platyrrhines, and provide               additional documentation about their adaptive diversity.                             The fossils from Argentina have come from two roughly                      contemporaneous formations, the Santa Cruz and the Pinturas, yet                the two formations have different species of monkeys.  This                     project will investigate the extent to which these morphological                differences are the result of differences in time, environment,                 and/or geographical position of the two formations, and the PI                  will reconstruct the paleoenvironments of these formations.  The                project will contribute to our understanding of the phylogeny and               diversification of New World primates, and permit broader                       comparisons between those in South America and those on other                   continents.",
