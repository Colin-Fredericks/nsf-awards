 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Schurr plans to study the rapid deformational Brownian                      motions of particular DNAs, DNA/Ligand complexes, and                           filamentous viruses by modern optical techniques, namely time-                  resolved fluorescence polarization anisotropy, transient                        photodichroism and dynamic light scattering.  Most of the                       studies are focussed on studying the effects of temperature,                    salt concentrations and base composition on the dynamics of DNA                 in the presence of Small molecules that bind to DNA, e.g.,                      ethidium chloroquine and methylene blue.  Some specific                         examples of these studies are:  1) to assess the local                          motions of intercalated ethidium as a function of temperature                   and viscosity;  2) to investigate the relative populations of                   different kinds of dye binding sites as a function of                           temperature, salt concentration and base composition;  3) to                    determine whether the structural transition induced in DNA by                   chloroquine at low salt concentration is local or long-range                    and to study its dependence on salt concentration;  4) to                       construct DNAs that are oligomers of the wild-type and mutant                   operators, to measure their twisting and bending                                rigidities, and to examine the effect of saturation binding                     on their tertiary structure;  5) to examine the effect of                       crystallization solvent on the twisting and bending rigidities                  of DNA; and  6) to measure the dynamic bending rigidities of                    filamentous viruses with similar radii but different internal                   structures.",
