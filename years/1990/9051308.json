 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental to all linguistic analysis is the actual phonetic data of           the spoken language. With the advent of the sound spectrograph and              \"visible speech\", \"ear phonetics\" has become a thing of the past; the           quantification of pitch, timbre, amplitude, and their variation over            time is made possible by a variety of devices, some of which can also           be employed to synthesize a speech signal. Undergraduates in                    linguistics need to acquire a facility with such devices, beginning             with their earliest attempts to collect and interpret linguistic data.          Core courses in which use of a speech analyzer will be heavy include            elementary and acoustic phonetics, sociolinguistics, phonology, and             linguistic field methods. In addition, the P.I. will be working with            students on research in the analysis of how speakers of various                 languages encode sarcasm through intonational and other sub-phonemic            means; the relative accessability and intrinsic interest of the project         provide a unique and nearly ideal entry for the investigation of some           fundamental issues, where relative novices can be expected to make              original contributions to knowledge. The college will contribute an             amount equal to the award.",
