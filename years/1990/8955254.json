 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 38 month program will work with a total of 80 teachers                     in the urban core of Phoenix, Arizona.  Four middle schools                     serving predominately minority ( Hispanic, Black and Native                     American ) students are the target group and will become                        demonstration schools for the seven school districts in this                    area.  The project will involve in this program for change                      not only school personnel but also parents, community leaders                   and student volunteers.                                                         Project personnel will teach teachers issues and topics                         relating to Science, Technology and Society (STS) and will                      teach curriculum development skills as well.  Eight teachers,                   two from each demonstration school, will be selected and                        trained as Master Teachers so that they can assist in                           dissemination of the curriculum.  Over a three year period                      the target schools (including the principals and middle                         school teachers) will be prepared to serve as \"Demonstration                    School-Communities\" thus conducting staff development,                          community development and curriculum reform workshops and                       activities for the target urban core schools and districts.                     Sharing the funding for this project with the National                          Science Foundation are Arizona State University, the Salt                       River Project, the Arizona Museum of Science and Industry and                   the school districts themselves.  The $560,270 NSF portion of                   funding will be matched by $217,489 from the above                              institutions which is approximately a 39% contribution.",
