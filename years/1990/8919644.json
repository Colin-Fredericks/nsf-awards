 "awd_abstract_narration": "The explosive progress in the neurosciences over the last decade                has not been matched by an increased understanding of the human                 brain and its role in human cognition.  Progress in cognitive                   neuroscience has been slowed by obvious ethical constraints on                  the experimental study of the human nervous system.  However,                   several recent technological developments have made it possible                 to visualize aspects of brain activity in novel and powerful                    ways.  Of particular importance is the fact that these techniques               can be used with awake behaving humans with virtually no risk and               practically no inconvenience to the subject.                                                                                                                    Two classes of techniques are particularly noteworthy, the                      radiological and the electro-magnetic approaches.  Radiological                 approaches make it possible to visualize metabolic processes in                 the intact brain.  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and                       Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are typical of these approaches,               as they allow investigators to determine with very fine spatial                 resolution the site of brain activity which is invoked in the                   course of clearly specified cognitive activity.  The electro-                   magnetic approaches monitor either the electrical or the magnetic               activity of the brain.  These can be monitored with remarkable                  temporal resolution, but with rather poor spatial resolution.                                                                                                   This action will provide NSF's share of the funding for a                       conference to be held in Carmel, California, during the first                   week of January, 1990, to discuss ways and means to integrate                   these novel techniques in order to enhance their power as tools                 for cognitive neuroscience.  For technological and theoretical                  reasons, each technique has developed its own experimental                      paradigms.  The conditions which are optimal for recording within               one approach often conflict with the demands which others impose                on an experiment.  A necessary condition for the integration is a               thorough mutual understanding of the paradigmatic constraints                   that shape the work in each of the domains.  It is for this                     reason that the conference will bring together investigators who                represent each of four main techniques to be considered.                                                                                                        The conference will be divided into three parts:  For the first                 day and a half, several prominent investigators will provide                    tutorials.  Then the participants will meet in four smaller                     panels, each of them receiving a very detailed charge.  A day and               a half will be devoted to the panel discussions.  Then, in the                  last two days, each panel will report to the assembled group its                response to the charge.",
