 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past decade, science and technology have come                   to be regarded as integral to the formulation of international                  political and economic policy.  In the Federal Government,                      the National Science Foundation plays a significant role in                     the support of such policies by planning and implementing                       international cooperation in science and technology through                     the promotion of activities designed to achieve the highest                     possible scientific and engineering benefits for U.S.                           science and engineering.  Within NSF, the Division of Inter-                    national Programs (INT) is the principal focal point for                        facilitating and supporting the agency's international                          science and technology initiatives.                                                  Important changes occurring in the world suggest that                      the development and implementation of effective international                   science and technology programs based on strategic information                  and careful policy analysis will be increasingly important in                   the 1990s.  Examples of pertinent changes include:  the                         movement toward economic integration in Western Europe, the                     opening of Eastern Europe, the increasing dynamism and                          economic cohesion in the Pacific Basin, and the growing                         aspirations and science and engineering capabilities of                         several major Latin American economies.  Thus, NSF will face                    multiple challenges that will require it to design and assess                   the efficacy of new initiatives, as well as evaluate the                        impacts of on-going programs in the international area.                         Planning for these activities will often require special                        meetings and conferences with selected U.S. and foreign                         experts in specific science and engineering disciplines, in                     addition to science policy specialists.  It will also require                   special studies on topics such as foreign capabilities in                       selected disciplines, or R&D expenditures and personnel                         estimates of foreign countries.                                                      In order to carry out its responsibilities in the                          international area and to develop new program and policy                        initiatives to respond to the challenges occasioned by the                      worldwide changes, INT requires external analytical and                         logistical support from a contractor who can draw on a range                    of substantive expertise about the global context for science                   and engineering, and who is also knowledgeable about NSF and                    INT's specific mission and operating constraints.  The                          objective of this contract is to provide for that support on                    a continuing basis.",
