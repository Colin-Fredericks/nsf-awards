The cooperating P.I.s are Dr. Erol                 Izdar of Dokuiz Eylul University of Izmir, Turkey and Dr. James W.              Murray, University of Washington.  Dr. Izdar recently received an               award to conduct this workshop as a NATO Advanced Study Workshop.               The NATO grant covers the operational expenses of the workshop and              travel expenses of non-U.S. NATO participants.  This proposal is                intended for the travel and expenses of 26 U.S. participants.  The              remaining U.S. participants, about thirteen will be supported by                other means.                                                                    The proposed workshop has a major objective of making an                        international interdisciplinary presentation of and the discussion              the results obtained from the five cruises conducted on the Black               Sea from April 15 to August 2, 1988 as the International                        Oceanographic Expedition of the Black Sea.  This expedition was                 planned and organized by U.S. and Turkish scientists meeting in                 Izmir, Turkey in June 1987.  The five separate cruises, each with a             major and separate emphasis, were conducted by some 110 scientists              from 39 institutions from eight countries.                                                                                                                      Scope:  The proposed workshop shop is scheduled about a year after              the completion of the at-sea phase.  This interval has provided time            and opportunity for significant data analysis.  This international              conference will be the first formal opportunity for a number of the             110 scientists from the different cruises, disciplines and countries            to come together in one location and compare their data and discuss             it in an interdisciplinary context.  This workshop will fulfill an              important phase detailed in a U.S.-Turkish Memorandum of                        Understanding (MOU) drawn up and signed at the June 1987 meeting.               The MOU provided formal ship clearances to conduct research in the              Turkish Exclusive Zone of the Black Sea.  This clearances were                  necessary to open up sea areas of scientific interest to fulfill the            objectives of the five cruises.  The MOU also made reference to the             conduct of workshop in Turkey approximately one year after the                  Expedition.                                                                     This proposal fulfills objectives of the Science in Developing                  Countries Program in its exchange and transfer of scientific                    knowledge through international collaboration.",
