 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological research is often enhanced by access to sophisticated                instrumentation for chemical analysis, but it is usually not                    cost-effective to have every instrument in every ecologist's lab.               This proposal requests funds for the acquisition of shared-use                  instrumentation that will permit a group of five ecologists at                  Fordham University's Calder Conservation and Ecology Center, with               diverse research interests, to enhance their chemical analytical                capabilities.  The instruments include a Technicon TrAAcs-800                   element analyzer, a Hewlett Packard HP5890A Capillary Gas                       chromatograph, a Waters High Performance Liquid Chromatography                  System, and  a Perkin-Elmer HGA Graphite Furnace for an existing                Perking-Elmer 1100B atomic absorption spectrophotometer.  These                 instruments will be used in the analysis of essential inorganic                 nutrients in water, sediment and plant tissue samples, complex                  organic compounds such as plant pigments and allelochemicals, and               trace elements and metals such as aluminum and selenium.  The                   research disciplines to which these enhanced analytical                         capabilities will be applied include behavioral ecology (foraging               choices of large primates based on nutritional quality),                        community ecology (species responses to nutrients, metal and                    biotic changes) and ecosystems ecology (biogeochemical cycles,                  paleoecology, climate change).",
