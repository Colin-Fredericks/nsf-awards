 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental questions addressed by this proposal relate to                      determining the basis for the presence of multiple genetic loci                 which encode acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) activity in                      Escherichia coli.  The AHAS reaction condenses two moles of                     pyruvate to one mole of form 2-acetolactate (AL), and one mole of               pyruvate with one mole of 2-ketobutyrate to form one mole of 2-                 aceto-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHB).  AL and AHB are biosynthetic                     precursors to L-valine and L-isoleucine.  Isozymes of AHAS                      partition, or channel, pyruvate carbons to AL or AHB according to               a specific partitioning bias, in response to 2-ketobutyrate                     levels.  The Distinct partitioning bias, measured by a constant                 R, is a distinct property of an AHAS isozyme, and appears to be                 an important determinant of survival under different conditions                 of nutrient supply.  AHAS II from two different alleles of ilvG,                ilvG468 and ilvG474, differently partition pyruvate carbons such                that the R-values are significantly different.  We propose to                   determine the molecular basis for the difference in R-values, and               to test hypotheses about the mechanism(s) of pyruvate                           partitioning.  By a molecular genetic study of mutant alleles of                ilvG, and steady state kinetic measurement, of pyruvate                         partitioning by resultant allozymes of AHAS II, we propose to                   identify structural domains which harbor amino acid residues that               constitute the active site(s) of AHAS II.  By use of a computer                 program (PARCOR) developed for this study, we have identified                   conserved structural domains common to AHAS isozymes I, II and                  III.  Spontaneous mutations in ilvG468 will be selected to change               the partitioning R-value to that of ilvG474, and alleles                        screened to identify mutations that alter R-values without                      perturbation of local secondary structure of resultant allozymes.               Screens for structural changes will be accomplished by use of the               PARCOR program.  Saturation mutagenesis of coding regions for                   conserved structural domains will be done to seek all possible                  amino acid changes that alter partitioning with out perturbing                  local protein structure.  Every ilvG allele will be tested for                  its ability singularly to support growth of E. coli on a rich and               poor carbon source.  By these approaches we expect to identify                  AHAS active site residues that are involved in differential                     partitioning of pyruvate carbons.",
