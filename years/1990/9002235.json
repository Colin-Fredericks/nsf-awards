 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF will provide the first of an expected five years of                     support to the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring                    Research.  It allows the laboratory to hire a full-time                         dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological samples and provides               half-time support for a graduate student assistant.                                                                                                             The technique of tree-ring dating was pioneered at Arizona.                     Because the rate of tree growth is determined by environmental                  conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in form and                      thickness.  It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by                cross matching trees from the present to well back in the                       prehistoric past and then to use this \"master record\" to date                   small wood samples collected from archaeological and other                      situations.  For archaeologists in the Southwestern United                      States, this technique has been a boon because it allows                        materials to be dated within one year.  This far exceeds the                    accuracy of radiocarbon dating.                                                                                                                                 Because it has not been adequately supported and because many                   archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the                      Arizona laboratory has not been able on its own to keep pace with               archaeological requests for sample dating.  This project will                   help to remedy that situation.  In particular, it will benefit                  young scientists and those not associated with main line research               institutions.",
