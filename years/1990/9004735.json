 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.Lambert and Dr.Goode will study a block to polyspermy in the                 Ascidian egg.  According to their model, the sperm bind to                      glycosides on the vitelline coat of the egg.  An increase in the                number of sperm binding to the vitelline coat is followed by a                  rapid decline.  This decline in binding helps insure that only a                single sperm enters the egg.  Sperm binding is inhibited by the                 Na+-dependent release of a glycosidase that modifies the                        vitelline coat sperm receptors.  They hypothesize that the                      glycosidase is initially linked to the egg membrane and is                      rapidly discharged at fertilization.  The fact that detergents                  and Phospholipase C can free the enzyme from the unfertilized egg               suggest that the enzyme is linked to a membrane phospholipid.                   Their model includes linkage of the glycosidase to a                            phosphatidylcholine and the Na+-dependent activation of a                       phospholipase that causes enzyme release.  The glycosidase and                  phospholipase will be isolated and extensively characterized.                   Antibodies will be prepared to both proteins for ultrastructural                enzyme localization.  The mechanism of release will be probed                   through the use of phospholipase agonists and antagonists and                   also through the direct measurement of phospholipase activity in                unfertilized and fertilized eggs.  The role of G proteins and                   ions in Ascidian egg activation will also be probed.                            %%%                                                                             Although millions of sperm are produced for each egg, if more                   than a single sperm enters the egg,cleavage is grossly abnormal                 and death is inevitable. As a consequence, blocking the entry of                additional sperm is of critical importance to fertility.                        Dr.Lambert and Dr. Goode will further the understanding of this                 phenomenon by studying the molecular details of sperm entry and                 blocking in the Ascidian system.",
