 "awd_abstract_narration": "TiNi Alloy Company proposes to develop high-force                               micro-actuators using vacuum deposited shape-memory                             alloys.  Improved micro-actuators are needed for micro-                         mechanical devices now being researched in laboratories                         (and which will reach market maturity in a few years)                           and for at least one device now in commercial production                        (a gas chromatograph on a silicon chip).  The potential                         advantage of shape-memory alloy microactuators over                             electrostatic devices is several orders of magnitude                            increase in force and displacement.  TiNi shape-memory                          alloy tolerates large strain, 3-5 percent, and produces                         large stress, greater than 100 mpa.                                                                                                                             Thin films of TiNi shape-memory alloy, which have been                          demonstrated in our laboratory to exhibit a forceful                            shape recovery, will be incorporated with silicon                               components by micro-fabrication.  The combined                                  technologies of shape-memory alloy and silicon will result                      in a new engineering material for micro-mechanical                              applications.                                                                                                                                                   The research objectives to be addressed include:                                improved vacuum sputtering techniques to improve yield                          and quality of film; physical characterization of TiNi film;                    planar fabrication by masking and selective etching; and                        development of functional components such as valve and                          pump actuators.",
