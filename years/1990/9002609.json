 "awd_abstract_narration": "An open International Conference on the Sodium Pump is planned for              September 5-9, 1990, at the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole,           MA.  It is the sixth in a series of triennial meetings, the third held          in the U.S., and the first sponsored by the Society of General                  Physiologists.  The pace of research on the sodium pump is                      accelerating.  The conference will offer a timely opportunity for               experts in these not (yet) overlapping fields to compare notes in an            intensive five-day discussion, and to disseminate their conclusions to          an audience much wider than the participants or the Society's                   membership, in particular, to colleagues working on other members of            the E1-E2 transport ATPase family.  Five major themes will be covered:          (1) Molecular Biology of the Sodium Pump; (2) Structural Studies both           empirical and theoretical; (3) Conformational Changes and Ion                   Occlusion; (4) Detailed steady-state and presteady-state (\"fast\")               kinetics of the various pump modes; and (5) Electrogenicity and voltage         dependence with emphasis on identifying the voltage sensitive step(s).          Twenty-seven, including thirteen non-U.S., speakers have been invited           to present comprehensive critical reviews of their own work and that of         others, and to write a chapter for the proceedings.",
