 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a number of cases, tuned mass dampers (TMDs) have been found to              be an appropriate method to suppress vibrations in buildings,                   floors, sports arena, and other structures.  The method is most                 effective for structures with low damping.  Essentially, passively              damped oscillators are added to the structure, and tuned to                     maximize the damping for the modes of the coupled structure-TMD                 system.  By ensuring that the critical modes involve strong                     participation of the TMD, it is possible to achieve substantial                 amounts of damping for the coupled system, even if the mass of the              TMD is only a small fraction of that of the structure.                                                                                                          It is proposed to develop a general methodology for optimum tuning              of the TMDs.  More precisely, this methodology will yield optimum               values of the spring stiffnesses and damping coefficients of the                TMD's for given TMD masses and locations.  The effects modal                    interaction will be included, yet the approach is simple enough to              be accessible to practicing engineers.  An additional advantage of              the proposed method is that it only requires a very concise                     description of the dynamic properties of the structure.  This                   description can for the most part be obtained from field vibration              measurements.",
