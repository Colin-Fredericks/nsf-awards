 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project restructures three courses in the electrical                       engineering curriculum to give an orderly progression through                   digital signal processing (DSP) into digital image processing (DIP)             while adequately covering the usual material found in these                     courses.  Electric Circuits II now provides sufficient background               for students to design and implement real-time digital filters on               a DSP chip.  Mathematics for Engineers contains enough discrete                 transform theory for students to utilize computational DSP software             effectively while the course in Communication Systems develops DIP              through digital image display and information extraction.                                                                                                       The curriculum developments have been made possible through the                 establishment of an applied DSP laboratory that has been created                with personal computers.  These together with DSP microprocessors,              headphones, microphones and cameras for sound and image inputs and              outputs permit DSP/DIP experiences as an integral part of the                   courses.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                principal investigator's institution.",
