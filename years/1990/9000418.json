 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of partial differential equations of three types                 motivates this work, which combines methods of harmonic and                     classical analysis in treating the problems outlined in the                     research plan.                                                                       It is well known that the free Schrodinger operator defined                on Euclidean space of any dimension maps integrable functions                   into bounded functions whose bound decays with reciprocal powers                of time.  Global existence for some non-linear Schrodinger                      equations with small initial data as well as results in                         scattering theory derive from this fact.  The estimate is poorly                understood and allows no flexibility for applications to the                    case where a potential is added to the Laplace operator.  Very                  recent results have now resulted in positive and sharp estimates                on the operator-plus-potential.  However, the conditions                        required of the potential are too restrictive to include                        physically significant examples.  This work will continue efforts               to determine the full set of potentials for which the estimates                 actually hold.                                                                       A second line of investigation concerns the Euler equation                 for an inviscid and incompressible fluid flow.  When                            incompressible fluid flow occurs with a high Reynolds number (a                 measure of viscous resistance) in 3-dimensions, singularities                   form in finite time.  However, this has only been demonstrated                  numerically.  Because the singularities can only occur if the                   vorticity is stretched, numerical approximation of solutions                    which form singularities is very subtle.  In this project a                     rigorous study of some prototype models with exact solutions will               be made.  These will then be used to check numerical methods and                possibly design new ones if the available ones are not sensitive                enough.                                                                              The third problem area concerns operators arising in the                   study of partial differential equations with rough coefficients.                The focus is on a question which has become known as the square-                root Kato conjecture.  It concerns the natural domain of the                    square-root of a divergence type second order differential                      operator.  This domain is believed to be a specific Sobolev space               of functions.  A discovery by A. McIntosh led to a deep                         connection between the identification of this domain and the                    boundedness of Cauchy-kernal operators on Lipschitz curves, a                   problem of considerable interest, which harmonic analysts have                  been studying for nearly two decades.  Recent work suggests that                a resolution of the conjecture may be at hand - at least in                     spaces of dimension less than five.  Work will continue toward                  this goal.",
