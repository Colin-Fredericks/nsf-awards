 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues work on modern aspects of Fourier                   analysis related to wavelet theory, weighted inequalities for the               Fourier transform and restriction theorems for the transform.                        Weighted Fourier transform inequalities are motivated by                   some of the central issues of signal processing.  In linear                     system theory, weights correspond to various filters in energy                  concentration problems.  Another area of application, prediction                theory, weighted Lebesgue spaces arise for weights corresponding                to power spectra of stationary stochastic processes.  The object                of the research is to obtain bounds on the q-th power norm of the               weighted Fourier transform in terms of the weighted p-th power                  norm of the signal (original function).  The program seeks best                 possible estimates.  This search gives rise to uncertainty                      principle inequalities; these provide natural constraints for                   determining the effectiveness of spectrum estimation techniques                 used in signal processing.  The methods of wavelet theory play a                basic role in this activity.  Initial efforts will focus on the                 special case of quadratic (weighted) norms.                                          Inequalities may be obtained when information concerning the               (integrals of) decreasing rearrangements of the weights can be                  computed.  The same condition obtains without rearranging the                   weights when the inequalities are valid.  What needs to be worked               out is what happens between the necessary and sufficient                        conditions.  Techniques derived from balayage combined with                     atomic decompositions of underlying tent spaces will be employed                in efforts to clarify the different conditions.",
