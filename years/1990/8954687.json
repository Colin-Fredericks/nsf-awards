 "awd_abstract_narration": "These investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study of mathematics         achievement of fifth-and eleventh-graders in Hungary.  The performance          of these students will be compared to that of American, Chinese and             Japanese students who are part of a longitudinal study.  A total of 240         11th-graders and 240 fifth-graders would be chosen at random from               representative schools.  In addition, the students, their mothers, and          teachers will be interviewed about their beliefs, expectations, and             attitudes about the children's achievement in mathematics.  An                  additional sample of 300 eleventh-graders will be given the test of             mathematics achievement and a questionnaire containing selected                 questions from the student interview.  In other cross-national                  comparisons, Hungarian students have been among the top performers, and         enrollment in advanced mathematics courses by Hungarian girls differs           little from that of boys.                                                                                                                                       Thus, inclusion of Hungarian students in a comparative study would add          important information about the correlates of high achievement in               mathematics and would offer additional insight into our understanding of        gender differences in enrollment in mathematics courses.  These data            will also allow a comparison with similar data being collected on 5th           and 11th graders in Japanese, Chinese and the United States.",
