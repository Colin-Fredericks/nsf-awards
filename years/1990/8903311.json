 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies is Escherichia coli have shown that not all                      spontaneous mutations occur randomly, but that instead that some                mutations are induced by selection, i.e. they are \"directed\" by                 the environment.  The objective of this proposal are to                         understand the origins of directed mutations, the relationship                  between directed mutations and selection or environmental stress,               the molecular and physiological basis of directed mutations, and                ultimately to evauluate the importance and role of directed                     mutations in evolution.  The achieve those objectives I shall                   characterize directed mutations in a variety of gene systems in                 Escherichia coli.  The first goal will be to describe the                       empirical \"rules\" that appear to govern the appearance of                       directed mutations.  Using that information, the next goal will                 be to elucidate the molecular and cellular mechanisms that are                  responsible for directed mutations.  Directed mutations have only               been detected in rather old colonies under conditions of                        nutritional and cellular stress.  A major effort will be devoted                to physiological studies of aged colonies in an effort to                       elucidate the relationship between cellular stress, environmental               conditions, and directed adaptive mutations.  These studies will                employ the approaches of classical microbial genetics together                  with modern molecular techniques for direct examination of the                  DNA.  The ultimate goal of these studies is to understand how                   directed mutations contribute to evolutionary processes, and to                 assess their importance in generating evolutionary diversity,                   particularly adaptive diversity.",
