 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-chain alkenones are now widely recognized as promising for                 the assessment of paleotemperature and to some extent                           paleoproductivity in surface waters of the ocean.  Ourability                   to interpret accurately the complete paleoceanographic                          implications of stratigraphic records for the alkenones                         inmarine sediment cores is currently limited by an ignorance of                 the ecology of the phytoplankton species that produce these                     biomarkers and of the ecology of the phytoplankton species that                 produce these biomarkers and of the processes responsible for                   their preservation in the sedimentary record.  This research                    will advance our ability to extract realistice                                  paleoceanographic information from the sedimentary record for                   the alkenonoes.  The project willintegrate results from                         analyses of laboratory phytoplankton cultures and particulate                   samples from the field.  The field samples include select sets                  of suspended particulate materials collected from ocean surface                 waters, vertically transported particulate materials collected                  in time series by sediment traps and underlying sediments                       collected by coring at three locations along an east-west                       transect off northern California.  The two major goals of the                   proposed work are to clarify 1) where alkenone-producing                        phytoplankton reside withing the euphotic zone as a function of                 season, when these organisms are productive during the year and                 what surface water temperature is recorded by alkenone                          unsaturation patterns measured in underlying sediments as a                     consequence of these factors and 2) how the downcore record for                 alkenone concentration relates torelative changes in                            prymnesiophyte productivity and perhaps total primary                           productivity in overlying waters with time.",
