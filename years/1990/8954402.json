 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a rapid growth in undergraduate computer science                 departments in the past few years, without sufficient growth in Ph.D.s          in Computer Science to staff these positions.  This means that in many          institutions the bulk of the computer science faculty have their                degrees in other fields and are self taught in computer science.  This          problem is compounded in undergraduate or teaching - oriented                   institutions where the faculty are expected to teach in several areas           and have difficulty in keeping up with the rapid progress in computer           science.  To enhance the quality of the undergraduate programs in               computer science, retraining and revitalization of the faculty is               necessary.                                                                                                                                                      Along with the retraining of the faculty, there is a need for the               development of new curriculum materials for use in the undergraduate            courses.  In this project for 48 undergraduate faculty, curriculum              materials are being developed and workshops are being held for                  undergraduate faculty in two areas:  Software Engineering and Computer          Graphics.  These two areas were chosen because of their increasing              importance and because they are both areas where recent hardware and            software developments have significantly changed what can be offered at         the undergraduate level.                                                                                                                                        The home institutions of the participants are contributing the travel           costs and Georgia State University is contributing an additional                $33,000 in support of the project.",
