 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membrane technology is a state-of-the-art area critical to many of              the traditional and emerging engineering fields.  It is important,              therefore, that undergraduate faculty be educated in the field of               membrane technology in order to integrate it into the engineering               curriculum .  Membrane processes are being incorporated into the                growing areas of biological engineering/biotechnology, hazardous                waste management, microelectronics production, specialty chemical               and biochemical production, biomedical engineering, and in the                  traditional chemical and petroleum industries.  This workshop is                combining both the lecture and laboratory components of this                    advanced technology providing participants with hands-on                        experience.  Workshop participants attend lectures on the                       fundamentals, design and applications of membrane processes such                as reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration, microfiltration,                           electromembranes, pervaporation, gas permeation and hybrid systems.             The undergraduate faculty participants perform experiments with                 state-of-the-art membrane systems and investigate actual                        applications to industry.  Several publications, a \"white paper\"                and laboratory manual result from the successful execution of this              workshop.  These publications substantially broaden the impact of               the project and significantly contribute to improvements in                     undergraduate science and engineering education.",
