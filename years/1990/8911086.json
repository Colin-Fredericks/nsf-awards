 "awd_abstract_narration": "This modest award assists Professor Paul I. Abell of the University             of Rhode Island to collaborate in paleoclimatology research with                Professor Hans-Joachim Pachur of the Institute for Physical Geography           of the Free University of Berlin, FRG.  The objective of their                  current research is to assess the degree to which stable isotope                analyses of the shells of ancient freshwater gastropods by Dr. Abell            give the same interpretation of paleoclimates as the geological/paleon-         tological approach used by Dr. Pachur.  The shells were collected by            Dr. Pachur from sites along a mid-Holocene Saharan river bed in the             northern Sudan, where he has been applying a variety of techniques to           the delineation of ancient climatic conditions.  Shell material will            be jointly selected from his collections, and Dr. Abell and his                 students will measure stable isotope ratios on these shells at short            intervals along the growth spirals.                                                                                                                             The environment in which man evolved in Equatorial Africa has been              the subject of extensive interest and study by anthropologists,                 archeologists, paleontologists and climatologists.  It has become               evident that climate may have been a significant factor in directing            evolutionary change, both morphologically and socially.  The                    measurement of stable isotope ratios in freshwater gastropod shells             may provide a valuable new tool in the armory of those scientists               interested in the Pliocene-Pleistocene-Holocene world.  Comprehensive           comparison and interpretation of the isotope and geological and                 paleontological data produced in this collaborative project will test           the validity of the stable isotope approach and provide useful                  research experience for several U.S. undergraduate and graduate                 students.",
