 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to develop a model system for the                     analysis of the role of learning in behavioral development.                     Experience can affect two aspects of development.  Experience can               affect which factors come to control a particular behavior and it               can influence the form of the behavior itself.  For example, in                 many species visual characteristics of food do not guide feeding                behavior until relatively late in development.  Additionally, in                many species the form of the feeding behavior changes, as when                  young mammals go from suckling to independent feeding.  In both                 of these examples, experience plays an important role in bringing               about the developmental change.                                                                                                                                 Developmentalists have long acknowledged a central role for the                 effects of experience on behavioral development, and traditional                studies of learning and memory have occupied a central place in                 psychology.  Yet, there has been little specific application of                 knowledge and principles in one domain to specific studies in the               other domain.  The current research project explores the                        possibility for synthesis of these areas by using principles of                 learning and memory to analyze developmental transitions.                                                                                                       The model system in which Drs. Balsam and Deich will study these                processes is the transition from dependent to independent feeding               in ring doves.  Both the transitions in controlling stimuli and                 changes in the form of feeding behavior will be described, and                  the processes underlying the transitions will be analyzed.  While               methods and theory for the study of changes in stimulus control                 have been well worked out in the area of learning, little                       attention has been given to the problem of how new forms of                     behavior are acquired.  So, in addition to contributing to the                  understanding the role of learning in development, these studies                also should contribute to the development of general methodology                and theory for the study of the induction and maintenance of new                forms of behavior.",
