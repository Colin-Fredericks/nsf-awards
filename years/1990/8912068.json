 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of using                   transition state analogue inhibitors to generate monoclonal                     antibodies that catalyze chemical transformations.  This strategy               provides us with unique tools for investigating chemical                        catalysis in proteins, as well as the means to create entirely                  new enzymatic activities for use in research, medicine and                      industry.  Here, a combined chemical and genetic approach is                    proposed to study and improve the properties of one such                        antibody, a catalyst for the stereospecific conversion of                       chorismate into prephenate.  Specifically, we plan to clone and                 sequence the genes for the chorismate mutase antibody 1F7 and                   engineer them for intracellular expression in a strain of the                   yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lacks the normal gene for                   chorismate mutase (essential for tyrosine and phenylalanine                     biosynthesis).  We will optimize the levels of expression and                   assembly of 1F7 to reconstitute the defective biosynthetic                      pathway and thereby allow the host cells to grow in the absence                 of exogenously added tyrosine and phenylalanine.  We will also                  exploit this system to perform classical genetic selection on the               antibody in order to improve its chemical efficiency.  Thus, the                host cells containing first-generation 1F7 will be grown under                  conditions such that only those cells survive that produce an                   improved version of the catalyst by random mutation.  In these                  experiments we will be monitoring, in essence, the evolution of a               protein catalyst not previously optimized by natural selection.                 Detailed characterization of the resulting 1F7 variants will                    enhance our understanding not only of how enzymes work but how                  they come to be the way they are.                                                                                                                               This combination of chemistry, immunology and molecular genetics                provides a general strategy for developing highly efficient                     protein catalysts for biomedical and industrial applications.  It               is being funded by the Division of Chemistry and Molecular                      Biosciences through the Chemistry of Life Processes Initiative.",
