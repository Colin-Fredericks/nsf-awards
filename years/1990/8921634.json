 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States continuing Consumer Expenditure (CE) Interview                Survey began in 1980.  This survey provided a rich source of                    detailed data on household income, employment, demographic                      composition, and asset positions, in addition to detailed data on               many categories of expenditures.  However, the form in which the                CE data was released to the public made it very difficult to use                these data, especially the household-level expenditure data.  The               purpose of this project is first, to consolidate the data in such               a way that the household survey can be more easily accessed,                    without losing any substantial detail.  The second task is to                   create a summary version of the data, sacrificing some                          detail for the purpose of creating an easily manipulatable                      database with annual expenditures on consumer goods.  The first                 two tasks will have substantial benefit to other researchers by                 making the resulting data sets widely available and, thus,                      avoiding unnecessary replication of tedious and complex data-                   matching and manipulation.  The third task will use the two data                sets for research in the areas of household and intra-household                 consumption patterns, household economies of scale, and household               equivalence scales.  The consolidation of the data sets will be                 of considerable use to a broad range of social scientists.",
