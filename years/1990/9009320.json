 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award will permit Dr. Susan Goldman to                  acquire new methodological skills relevant to understanding how                 people learn from written material.  In previous work, Goldman                  provided evidence that readers exhibit a great deal of                          flexibility in the strategies they use to learn from text.                      Goldman will study how readers select various strategies by (1)                 having readers describe and explain their reading behavior, and                 (2) creating computer models of the reader that vary the                        knowledge available to the \"reader.\"  To do the computer modeling               work, Goldman will acquire the necessary skills by studying at                  two research laboratories where scientists are engaged in this                  type of work.  She will pursue skills in two approaches to                      modeling, one relying on the assumption that readers have many                  rules that govern their behavior and a second that makes the                    assumption that readers operate with very few of these rules.                   Goldman will spend approximately two months at each research                    laboratory, devoting the remainder of her time to implementing                  the project at her home institution.  The activities in which                   Goldman is engaged will enhance understanding of the knowledge                  requirements of different types of reading material, of the types               of strategic knowledge for reading that lead to efficient                       learning from text, and of how texts can be written to facilitate               understanding and learning.  Ultimately, the information and the                techniques Goldman is developing can be used to assist in the                   diagnosis and remediation of developmental and adult reading                    difficulties.   Thus, this career advancement award will                        contribute toward improving independent learning skills and                     levels of literacy in our society.",
