 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is jointly funded by the Experimental Physical                     Chemistry Program and the Special Projects Office to initiate a                 summer research program in diatomic molecular spectroscopy                      involving undergraduates at the end of their freshman and                       sophomore years.  Professor Tellinghuisen is providing                          organized and informal instruction equivalent to an                             undergraduate course in diatomic spectroscopy, while involving                  the students in real spectroscopic experiments and spectral                     analysis.  This program is contributing to the spectroscopic                    data base, while also training undergraduates in research                       methods valuable in their later careers.  A major goal of this                  project is achieving success in increasing the number of                        undergraduates choosing a science career by involving them in a                 research project early in their education.                                                                                                                      Systems studied include molecules potentially of importance in                  the media of electronic transition lasers, including diatomic                   halogens, rare gas halides, and metal halides.  Spectra are                     generated in mild tesla discharges at ambient or lower                          temperatures.  The dispersed spectra are recorded on                            photographic film or plates at a typical resolution of 200,000.",
