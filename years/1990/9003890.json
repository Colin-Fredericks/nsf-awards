The ATC-20 \"Procedures for Postearthquake Safety                                Evaluation of Buildings,\" published by Applied Technology                       Council (ATC) on September 19, 1989, were used extensively                      throughout Northern California to evaluate buildings                            damaged by the magnitude-7.1 October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta,                      California, earthquake.  The widespread application of the                      methodology on several thousand buildings by building                           officials and volunteer structural engineers from                               throughout the state has provided a rare and ideal                              opportunity to assess the merits and possible pitfalls of                       the methodology.                                                                                                                                                Based upon such an experience, this project will conduct a                      study to review, evaluate, and possibly revise the ATC-                         20.  The specific objectives are to: (1) document the                           application of the ATC-20 methodology; (2) conduct a                            workshop to review, expand, and evaluate this                                   documentation and develop recommendations for improved                          procedures; (3) develop and publish an addendum to the                          ATC-20 Report containing a summary of the Loma Prieta                           earthquake experience, a summary of the project workshop                        findings, additional instructions and clarifications for                        \"difficult to determine\" posting situations, and a                              recommended management program for local building                               officials; (4) revise and re-publish, if necessary, the                         ATC-20 Report and ATC-20-1 Field Manual; and (5) conduct                        training seminars that include an overview of the Loma                          Prieta experience.
