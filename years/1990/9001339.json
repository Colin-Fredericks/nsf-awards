 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graduate student Jose Villasenor under the guidance of Dr.                 Tom Elias of Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying the                    Mexican and Guatemalan species of Senecio section Mulgedifolii, a               poorly known group of tropical montane sunflower relatives.  He                 plans a broad survey of features of morphology, chromosome                      composition, and analysis of variation in chloroplast DNA.  The                 goals include evaluation of morphological characters that provide               stable, reliable guides to the identification of species; mapping               of the geographic distributions of the estimated 15 or so species               throughout Mesoamerica; and inference of the evolutionary                       relationships among these species and with closely related groups               of Senecio.                                                                          Villasenor has published a number of papers on the plant                   resources of Mexico, and has conducted field work in several                    regions of the country.  The broad approach he is taking to the                 study of plant biodiversity, encompassing both traditional                      morphological investigation and laboratory analysis of genetic                  and genomic variation, will bring increased understanding of                    tropical plant resources in the Americas, and in turn the                       research will contribute to training of the next generation of                  plant scientists.",
