 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in algebraic combinatorics                of Professors Adriano Garsia and Jeffrey Remmel of the University               of California at San Diego. They plan to develop combinatorial                  algorithms for the construction of representations and their                    decompositions into irreducible components. Among the specific                  topics they will work on are: the new Macdonald polynomials and                 their possible setting in representation theory; the structure of               descent algebras of Coxeter groups; and the explicit evaluation                 of the coefficients in Schur function expansions in certain                     symmetric formal power series.                                                       This research falls in the broad category of combinatorics,                which is one of the most active fields in today's mathematics.                  Fundamentally, combinatorics represents a systematization of the                very first of all mathematical activities, counting. In its                     modern development, however, combinatorics has gone beyond just                 counting to make use of a wide variety of advanced mathematical                 techniques, and although its roots go back several centuries, the               field has had an explosive development in the past few decades                  because of its importance in communications and information                     technology.",
