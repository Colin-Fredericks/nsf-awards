 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Miklos Kertesz of Georgetown University           to collaborate in materials research with Professor Hans Kuzmany of the         Institute for Festkoerperphysik, University of Vienna.  They share an           interest in the structure, electronic structure and vibrational                 spectroscopy of conducting polymers, topics at the forefront of the             electroactive materials field.  They have collaborated successfully on          resolving the role of conjugation length in the optical absorption              of polyacetylene, the prototype conducting polymer.  Now they will              address central issues relating to an important class of conducting             heterocyclic polymers derived from polythiophene.  They will study              two alternate forms derived by ring fusion and by side group addition.          The Austrian group will use its experimental expertise to generate              vibrational spectra that will be interpreted by the theoretical                 Georgetown group, using its expertise in quantum chemistry.  The U.S.           group has developed a calculational strategy for the prediction of              structure and energy gap of conjugated heterocyclic polymers.  The              Viennese group has developed a strategy to obtain vibrational force             constants based on monomers in an empirical fashion.                                                                                                            Research in the field of conducting polymers lends itself to an                 interdisciplinary approach.  The proposed research joins the                    complementary expertise and skills of an experimental group in                  Austria with a theoretical group in the U.S.  Vibrational spectroscopy          and quantum chemical thoery together form an ideal combination of               tools to resolve polymeric structure.  The results should provide               insights into the nature of these new electroactive polymers and to             new structure-property relationships.  This may lead to the ability             to control the variations of properties of these materials, that is,            to design new materials with desired optical and electronic properties.",
