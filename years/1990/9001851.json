They have to be acquired through real-life                                      events which in the case of an earthquake is                                    a rare occurrence.  The most significant                                        events in the transportation and                                                transportation related-field that followed the                                  October 17, 1989 San Francisco Bay Area                                         earthquake is the collapse of transportation                                    facilities, particularly bridges, which caused                                  discontinuity in the transportation network.                                    These failures impacted several emergency                                       management functions such as search and                                         rescue, fire fighting and site evacuations.                                     They also restricted the movement of people                                     and goods among the various communities of the                                  Bay Area.                                                                                                                                                       The main focus of this project is to study and                                  assess the impacts of transportation system                                     failures on emergency management functions and                                  to evaluate the development and implementation                                  of various traffic diversion strategies                                         carried to provide accessibility and mobility                                   to the travelers in the affected region.  The                                   developed strategies and models will enhance                                    the work conducted after the Mexico City                                        earthquake in this field, and test its                                          applicability to the U.S. environment.                                                                                                                          The results will assist emergency managers and                                  planners in the location and allocation of                                      personnel and equipment, in the dispatch of                                     emergency vehicles, and in the development of                                   traffic diversion strategies that will avoid                                    bottlenecks and minimize delays.  They will                                     also bring into focus the tremendous                                            transportation costs incurred by business as                                    well as by individuals as a result of the                                       failure of key elements of the transportation                                   network.",
