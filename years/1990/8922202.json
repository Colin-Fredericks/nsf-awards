Mayer, Nowell and Jumars will undertake several                            complementary studies to determine the relationship between                     sediment transport in coastal environments and the quality and                  quantity of food for benthic animals.  They will focus on                       particulate food quality for deposit feeders, although many of                  our results also should be useful for suspension feeders,                       heterotrophic bacteria, and heterotrophs in general.  The studies               will range from field measurements of food quality, to laboratory               experiments of feeding responses with engineered food materials,                to laboratory flume experiments testing the relationships between               sediment dynamics and food quality variables.   With species                    conveniently available and these estimates, they will investigate               the ideas that deposit feeders benefit from horizontal sediment                 transport as an increase in rate of food supply due to simple                   lateral homogenization of the resource, that surface deposit                    feeders benefit from the vertical hydrodynamic sorting produced                 by resuspension and redeposition, and that deposit feeders                      benefit from stimulation of microbial growth due to transport.",
