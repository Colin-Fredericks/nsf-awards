 "awd_abstract_narration": "A six legged parallel link manipulator (called a Stewart                        Platform) has the ability to perform six degree of                              freedom manipulation, and is mechanically much simpler                          than conventional serial mechanisms with similar                                manipulative capability.  Despite their mechanical                              simplicity, such mechanisms have not been exploited                             except for low accuracy, low speed applications because                         of  the difficulty in performing real-time control of the                       highly non-linear, highly coupled mechanism.  The control                       problem is exacerbated by the fact that there is no known                       closed from solution to the forward kinematics of such                          platforms.  This project will develop two cooperating                           neural nets which together help control a six legged                            parallel link manipulator in the high speed, high accuracy                      domain.  Each of the two neural nets is itself composed                         of tow cascaded neural nets.  The proposed system is                            interesting because it solves a problem for which there is                      no known acceptable solution, and also because there                            are many important applications which could be cost                             effectively implemented with a stewart Platform if the                          control problem could be overcome.  The proposed                                system is also significant because is cascaded organization                     of neural nets should greatly reduce the training time                          required for the system to achieve good results.",
