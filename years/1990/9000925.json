 "awd_abstract_narration": "In todays extremely competitive manufacturing markets the                  optimization and upgrading of manufacturing process and procedures              is a continual process.  Grinding has traditionally been a final                machining operation, performed on components to impart required                 dimensional accuracy and surface finish.  Current trends in                     research, however, have led grinding to the high stock removal                  regime where in areas such as creepfeed grinding and high speed                 centerless grinding, process developments have allowed grinding to              compete with other primary machining operations such as milling                 and turning.  Fundamental studies, particularly in Europe, have                 resulted in predictable grinding operations which yielded both                  higher quality and increased productivity.  Thus it is essential                that this new technology be brought to American industry.  This                 award establishes an Industry/University Cooperative Center for                 Grinding Research at the University of Connecticut.  The Center's               research theme is to conduct fundamental and advanced level studies             of the grinding process, and to develop and maintain a grinding                 data base accessible to industry.                                                    Six industry members have already joined the center providing              $300,000 in support.  The University of Connecticut has agreed to               forego its overhead charges (approximately $175,000 per year).  In              addition, industrial members have also contributed equipment to the             center and adequate computers, laboratory space and instruments for             the proposed research are in place.                                                  The Program Manager recommends that the University of                      Connecticut be awarded $75,000 each year for five (5) for the                   initiation of the Center for Grinding Research and Development.                 $50,000 is to come from the I/UCRC program and $25,000 is to come               from the Manufacturing Systems Program (Marvin F. Devries, Program              Director).                                                                           Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager                  and/or Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review the             progress of the Center on a number of renewal criteria, including               the following:  (1) extent to which university/industry interaction             and collaboration is developing: (2) extent to which the support                base for the center is expanding; (3) extent to which a rebust                  research program is developing.  If review is satisfactory, the                 Program Manager will recommend support of the next period of this               continuing grant.",
