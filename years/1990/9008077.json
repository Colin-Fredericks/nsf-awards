 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the area of small groups is important to the complete               understanding of social behavior.  Currently, the study of groups               is limited by the lack of adequate statistical tools to describe                fully the ongoing processes that occur in small groups.  One of                 the most interesting and important aspects of group research is                 that people interact with one another in groups and, through this               interaction, influence one another.  Methods which are available                today either ignore or treat as a statistical nuisance the fact                 that people in groups interact with one another and are,                        therefore, linked to one another.  Understanding the links                      between people in groups will help clarify the nature of social                 interaction in small groups.  This research will investigate                    three different research designs.  The first design, influence                  networks, involves models of the extent to which people influence               each other in groups.  These types of models allow study of the                 effect of different types of influence hierarchies on group                     productivity and group member satisfaction.  The second design is               the rotation design, in which people move from group to group.                  In the rotation design, each person participates in several                     groups, so that the consistency of individual behavior when a                   person becomes a member of a new group can be examined.  The                    third design is the generations design.  In this design, there is               a turnover in group membership.  Some group members enter the                   group and other members leave.  This design essentially models                  the birth and death cycles in families.  This design allows                     examination of the stability of group norms with changing                       members.  For each area, the research will explore design                       considerations and develop data analysis techniques and computer                software.  These methods should be of use to researchers of                     leadership, social influence, group socialization, productivity,                and personality.",
