 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major issue in the study of animal learning has been the                    processes involved in how an animal associates two events with                  each other.  The traditional answer to this question has been                   that such associations are formed automatically because the two                 events occur at the same time, or one event occurs just before                  the other.  But we now know that such an answer is too simple,                  because the strength of the association depends critically upon                 the context of events in which the two events occur.  For                       example, if an animal is presented a pairing of sound with food,                the likelihood of a sound-food association may vary, depending                  upon whether or not other events in the conditioning environment                have a pre-existing association with food.                                                                                                                      Dr. Williams will analyze the behavioral processes underlying                   such contextual effects, for a variety of different conditioning                procedures.  Such analysis is important because basic                           conditioning processes have been used increasingly in studies of                neural organization with primitive animals (e.g., Aplysia) and                  now form the basis of neural-network models that constitute the                 major theoretical development in human cognitive psychology in                  the past decade.  Thus, a proper understanding of how contextual                effects are mediated has major implications for several different               areas of psychology and physiology.",
