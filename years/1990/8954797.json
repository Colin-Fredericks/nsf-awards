 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to infuse into the secondary school                          mathematics curriculum concepts and techniques from the                         modern topics of dynamical systems and fractal geometry.                        The purpose is to modernize the existing curriculum and more                    fully motivate the study of traditional topics.  Computers,                     software, and related equipment provide the vehicles for                        exploring the new mathematics concepts as well as offer                         opportunities for flexible instructional systems at the                         school level.  The project's format is to work with many                        teachers (grades 7-12) from single districts rather than                        single teachers from many districts.                                                                                                                            This is a collaborative effort between Boston University, the                   Belmont School System and the Boston School System.  All of                     the junior and senior high schools in the Belmont District                      and four schools in the Boston District are involved in the                     project.  Beginning in the summer of 1990, a set of seminars                    will be offered to teams of teachers (45 total) from these                      schools.  This set of participants will remain with the                         project for its four year duration.  They deal with the                         essential ideas from dynamical systems and fractal geometry                     as well as didactical issues involving innovative teaching                      techniques afforded by the existing technology.  Teachers                       will work in the technology classroom and the computer labs                     at the university during the summer months and during monthly                   meetings throughout the year.  The seminars provide the                         teachers with a knowledge base in the new mathematics topics                    as well as practical experience in using the technology.  The                   districts  will emulate the technology application as it is                     appropriate for their local situations.                                                                                                                         The goals of the project are that:  1) the mathematics                          curriculum at the district schools will be modified to                          incorporate the new mathematics as well to more fully                           motivate the mastery and application of traditional skills;                     2) the teachers will learn and have confidence with new                         mathematics and be able to apply new instructional strategies                   with their students; and 3) the dynamics of the schools                         involved will change to more effectively provide mathematics                    learning experiences within a multiplicity of formats for                       their students.                                                                                                                                                 Costs sharing in an amount of $371,982 represents 29% of the                    NSF award.",
