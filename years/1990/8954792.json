 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project for the special initiative, \"Projects                   to  Promote the Use of Technology in the Teaching of Science                    and  Mathematics\", is designed to effect change in                              mathematics  education by integrating technology into the                       classroom.  The  project will focus on graphing calculators                     and symbolic  manipulators, and will include the use of                         spreadsheets, CD ROMs,  and state-of-the-art software in                        teaching and learning  statistics, discrete mathematics,                        number theory, computation,  geometry, algebra, and advanced                    mathematics.  The project aims to alter instructional and                       learning strategies by incorporating technology with content                    knowledge and cognitive skills.  The program will develop                       instructional materials and classroom models for effective                      integration of the technology.  Participants will be selected                   in teams of five grade 6-12 teachers to facilitate                              coordination between middle and secondary schools.  The ten                     teams  selected will participate in three-week summer                           workshops for three summers and in follow-up activities                         during the subsequent academic years.  Set in southeastern                      Wisconsin, the targeted schools are in areas with large                         minority populations, and special attention will be paid to                     stimulating the interest of under-represented groups in                         mathematics.  The project will promote the ownership of the                     teachers' role as effective change agents for mathematics                       education within and across districts.  This project is                         mainstream - oriented squarely in the direction currently                       advocated by the mathematical community.",
