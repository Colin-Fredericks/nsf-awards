 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current knowledge of the patterns of water and solute regulation in           terrestrial vertebrates is based largely on studies of mammals, birds,          and amphibians.  Studies of reptiles are for the most part limited to           turtles and snakes, for which information has only just begun to                accumulate, and lizards remain largely unstudied.                                 This research will exploit the ontogenetic variability in                     osmoregulatory patterns of lizards as the mesonephric kidney ceases to          function after birth and the metanephric kidney assumes its adult role          in water and ion balance.  These investigations are being conducted at          several levels:                                                                   1) Physiological properties of the whole kidney, as well as of                individual nephrons, will be studied with respect to the regulation of          filtration and of ion and water balance.                                          2) The morphological changes that occur in the mesonephric and                metanephric kidneys with postnatal development will be documented in            terms of both the structural organizations of the tissue and the                ultrastructural changes at the cellular level.                                    3) Information from the physiological and morphological studies will          be integrated to yield a picture of the interrelationships between              structure and function.                                                           This study is the first to examine the osmoregulatory physiology and          morphology of a neonatal reptile and in fact represents one of only a           very few to study osmoregulation in any newborn vertebrate.  The                information gained from this study will not only significantly advance          our understanding of the patterns of osmoregulation in lizards and              other reptiles, but will also provide a basis for understanding the             ontogenetic changes in the osmoregulatory roles of the mesonephric and          metanephric kidneys both before and after birth in other vertebrates.             The interactive activities will involve team-teaching two courses in          Physiology as well as presenting research seminars in two departments           on campus; and participation in an ongoing seminar on \"Women in the             Biological Sciences,\" which centers on gender issues.  Dr. Beuchat              will also teach a graduate seminar entitled \"On Being a Scientist.\"             This seminar will focus on acquisition of information and skills                necessary for success in academic science that are not traditionally            part of the graduate curriculum.  The seminar will include discussions          of CV preparation, applying for research grants, giving a talk at a             meeting, getting a job in academia, and the ethics of science.                    This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
