 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor James P. Riehl of the University of               Missouri at St. Louis for collaborative research with Professor Harry           P. J. M. Dekkers of the Department of Chemistry, State University of            Leiden, The Netherlands.  They are pursuing several related projects            on chiral and racemic mixtures through the use of a new time-resolved           circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) apparatus.  Professor Dekkers           has built such an apparatus in Leiden, and offers experimental                  experience in measurements of luminescence in chiral organic systems,           while Professor Riehl has expertise in theoretical analysis and some            experimental work on the stereochemistry of aqueous lanthanide                  complexes.  The interests and skills of the two investigators mesh              very well.                                                                                                                                                      This project focuses on an emerging area of spectroscopy that may               have a significant impact on a number of significant problems, both             fundamental and applied.  The proposed collaboration should further             develop the experimental and theoretical underpinnings of time                  resolved CPL experiments.  A better understanding of molecular                  energy exchange and conformational dynamics in chiral lanthanides               should also result.",
