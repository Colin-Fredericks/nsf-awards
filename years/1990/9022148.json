 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Human Genome Project burst upon the scene in the period 1985-               1986 and has become a major topic of debate among life scientists,              ethicists, and policy makers.  The Genome Project is often touted               as the first foray into Big Biology -- a biological equivalent to               the Apollo and Manhattan Projects.  The debate about genome                     projects has had the feel of historical importance since its                    inception.  Those arguing for and against it have self-consciously              placed this project in a prominent position among the landmarks of              biology.  Whether it belongs in this pantheon remains to be seen,               but the quality and intensity of debate and the extraordinary power             and character of the advocates makes the Human Genome Project a                 wonderful case study in how a scientific project is placed on the               national agenda, and what transpires once it is there.  The Genome              Project is thus an ideal opportunity to document the life sciences              in transition from pure cottage industry to a mix of Big and little             science.                                                                                                                                                        Because of the evanescence of documentation and memory of the                   individuals involved, it is essential to move quickly to establish              a strategy for collection and preservation of materials related to              the Human Genome Projects.  The Kennedy Institute of Ethics, as the             National Reference Center for Bioethics Literature, is holding a                workshop of interested historians, social scientists, ethicists,                archivists, biologists, and policy makers to begin to formulate                 such a national strategy.  The meeting is being held at Georgetown              University in October, 1990",
