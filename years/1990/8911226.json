 "awd_abstract_narration": "Toxic dinoflagellates bloom sporadically in coastal waters                 throughout the world, often causing outbreaks of paralytic                      shellfish poisoning (PSP). The recurrent economic and public                    health impacts of these blooms range from human illness and death               to extensive quarantine of shellfish resources. Although the                    chemical structure and pharmacological activity of the PSP toxins               are well understood, their metabolic role within the                            dinoflagellate remains unknown, as are the factors that cause                   variability in toxicity between isolates from different regions                 or in one isolate under different growth conditions. Within the                 context of a regional population of Alexandrium (formerly                       Gonyanulax) species, Dr. Anderson will continue investigations in               four general research areas.  Specifically, he will examine: a)                 the dynamics of toxin production with major emphasis on the link                we are now hypothesizing between toxin production and the                       dinoflagellate cell cycle; b) the physiology of toxin production,               through studies on the causes and effects of elevated free                      arginine concentrations in the cell and identification of                       proteins involved in toxin synthesis; c) toxin localization and                 function through immunocytochemical studies at the                              ultrastructural level and efforts to purify and characterize a                  saxitoxin-binding complex from the dinoflagellate nucleus; and d)               population comparisons through mating studies and development of                molecular methods to discriminate between closely-related                       isolates of Alexandrium.",
