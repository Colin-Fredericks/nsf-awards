 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Provasoli-Guillard Center contains the world's largest                 culture collection of marine phytoplankton.  The cultures are                   distributed to scientists, aquaculture hatcheries, industrial                   firms (especially biotechnology companies), and governmental                    agencies throughout the world.  Marine phytoplankters are the                   \"plants\" of the ocean and they form the base of the food chain in               ocean systems.  Because oceans cover over 70% of the Earth's                    surface, phytoplankton play a dominant role in global ecology.                  Scientists use cultures of phytoplankton in experiments to study                the potential effects of global changes caused by carbon dioxide                increases (the greenhouse effect) and of ultraviolet light damage               from ozone holes, as well as searching the diversity of                         phytoplankton organisms for natural products that may be used to                cure human or other diseases.  The recent rapid expansion of                    marine aquaculture is largely due to the use of phytoplankton                   cultures as foods for larval and juvenile shellfish and finfish.                                                                                                     This project will provide partial support for the Provasoli-               Guillard Center's maintenance costs of the phytoplankton culture                collection for the next five years.  Living phytoplankton must be               maintained continuously in culture, since no methods have been                  perfected for their cryopreservation.  During the award period,                 the Center will begin a major revision of its computer database,                and will provide on-line access to the database.  It will also                  install new culture chambers to enable a wider range of cultures                to be maintained.  Finally, a replacement autoclave will be                     purchased for sterilization of media and glassware in order to                  insure pure culture conditions.",
