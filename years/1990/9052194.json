 "awd_abstract_narration": "Standard laboratory exercises in introductory physics courses have              little in common with actual research, and are not particularly                 effective at developing the students' physical intuition.  This                 project is reshaping the introductory physics laboratory exercises              to allow students the freedom and creativity to discover physical               phenomena and the laws that govern them.  When learning occurs by               discovery the development of physical intuition is greatly enhanced             when compared to traditional approaches.  Since there are no fixed              procedures for students to follow, students must have general purpose           and powerful laboratory tools.  Central to the implementation of                discovery experiments is the introduction of microcomputer based                laboratories (MBLs).  A network of eleven Macintosh SE computers                served by an SE/30 file server is the central tool.  To acquire data            from almost any experiment, each machine has an interface and sensor            assortment.  The sensors include photogates, ultrasonic rangers,                Geiger detectors, and force probes.  For example, with these tools              students may acquire the position of a moving object (perhaps                   themselves) as a function of time, and immediately see a graph of the           object's velocity or acceleration.  To analyze the computer acquired            data students again use general purpose tools. Computer spreadsheets,           graphing, and communication software are being used to quickly find             final results.  These software and hardware tools allow students to             investigate physical phenomena with a minimum of tedium, maximizing             the time spent doing physics.  The University is matching the award             with an equal amount of funds.",
