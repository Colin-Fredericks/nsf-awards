 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will use his characterization of                the Kobayashi metric on smoothly bounded convex domains to study                the asymptotic behavior of this metric at a boundary.  The                      ultimate goal is to solidify the relationship between complex                   function theory on the domain and the geometry of the boundary.                 In a second project he will study the global properties of                      contact structures on manifolds of dimension three.  Topological                invariants of the contact structure will be constructed                         analytically.                                                                        Many of the most significant theorems in geometric analysis                relate geometric and topological invariants.  One of the earliest               of these was the relationship between the total Gaussian                        curvature of a smooth surface and its numbers of tubes and cross                caps.  In the present project, the principal investigator will                  relate global Riemannian contact structures to the base topology                of the manifold.",
