 "awd_abstract_narration": "The giant foraminiferan protist, Astrammina rara, is protected by               an outer shell (test) of mineral grains tightly bound by a                      chemically-resistant, biological cement or extracellular matrix.                Cursory observations indicate that A. rara's network of branching               and anastomosing pseudopodia collects larger particulates from the              sediment, secretes the test matrix, and through its coordinated                 activity, sculpts the test.  The large size, ease of handling, and              high abundance of A. rara at the Antarctic collection site makes                this organism uniquely suited for studying specific aspects of test             construction.  Because A. rara is a giant single-cell system,                   general questions regarding the assembly of extracellular matrix                components in a cold-adapted organism can be studied without the                complications common to metazoan systems.  Adaptations in certain               basic cellular processes involved in test construction are of                   particular interest because these processes are inhibited by                    subzero temperatures in the cells of organisms from temperate                   climates.  Various biotechnological methods will be used to gain                information on test construction at the cellular and molecular                  levels of analysis.  Completion of the proposed studies will not                only help solve an interesting and longstanding biological                      question, but will also provide a framework for future molecular                studies of the physiology and evolution of this important protistan             taxon.",
