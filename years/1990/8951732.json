 "awd_abstract_narration": "Before the current advent of solid modeling techniques, computer-               aided design strategies did not substantially differ from the                   design strategies used with traditional design tools:  drafting                 boards and calculators.  Recently, a wide gap has developed in                  these strategies and today new approaches are available to a                    modern mechanical engineering designer.  These new approaches rely              heavily on powerful graphics workstations and integrated CAD                    software which are becoming more and more affordable for routine                design work.                                                                                                                                                    The project is concerned with modernizing the sequence of design                courses in a traditional mechanical engineering curriculum by                   introducing three-dimensional solid modeling techniques and                     integrated CAD systems into these courses, starting with the                    freshman course on engineering design graphics and continuing                   through the senior capstone design project.  Modern computer-aided              design laboratories will be organized and educational materials                 developed that will support the concept of designing a mechanical               component in three-dimensional space and using the created data                 base for direct analysis of its static, dynamic, flow, or thermal               characteristics.",
