 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most intriguing questions in evolutionary biology               at the present time is:  why do so many natural populations have                males and females?  Stated in another way:  why don't females                   reproduce asexually and thereby produce only clonal daughters?                  Assuming no concomitant reduction in fecundity, a rare asexual                  female would produce twice as many daughters (and four times as                 many granddaughters) as the average sexual female; and unchecked,               the resulting clone would grow exponentially, eventually                        replacing the sexual females and males in the population. That                  sexual reproduction persists in the face of the advantage of                    clones suggests that there is an advantage to producing variable                offspring.  It is currently unknown, however, what this                         advantage is.                                                                        To address the question, it is important to study species                  that have both reproduction modes, so that there is a firm basis                for comparison.  In one such species, a freshwater New Zealand                  snail, sexual reproduction is correlated with the incidence of                  infection by parasitic worms, which is consistent with the idea                 that the production of variable progeny is favored in                           populations where there is a high risk of parasitism.  The goals                present study are to:  (1) determine whether  there is a genetic                basis to the host-parasite  interaction, (2) establish whether                  parasites can prevent the elimination of sexual individuals by                  one or more clones, and (3) to assess the effect of parasites on                the maintenance of genetic diversity within snail populations.                  In addition to addressing important questions regarding sexual                  versus clonal reproduction, the results of these studies have                   important  implications for  the study of diseases caused by                    similar worms that cycle through snail vectors (e.g. human                      schistosomiasis), and the role that biological enemies play in                  preserving genetic diversity of natural populations.",
