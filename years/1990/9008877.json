 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunities for Women Career Advancement Award                  is in the general area of organic chemistry.  Dr. Margaret V.                   Merritt of the Chemistry Department at Wellesley College will                   develop methods for using electric dipole moment measurements                   to examine the association and structure of chiral ion pairs.                   The interionic geometry of ion pairs in particular solvents may                 be correlated with the electric dipole moment.  In this study,                  both of the ions will have an asymmetric center: the cation                     will be a quaternary amine and the anion will be the salt of                    mandelic acid.  The capacitance and conductance measurements                    will be made with the advice of Dr. Ernest Grunwald, emeritus                   professor of Brandeis University, who has experience in this                    field.  A postdoctoral worker and an undergraduate student will                 participate in the project.                                                                                                                                     This award will enable Dr. Merritt to establish a new                           capability that is complementary to kinetic studies she has                     carried out previously.  It is anticipated that undergraduate                   students will be able to participate readily in these new                       projects.  Future student projects will involve the preparation                 and characterization of novel chiral ion pairs and                              determination of the solvent dependence of the dipole moment of                 a single ion pair.  Infrared and proton nmr spectroscopy and                    X-ray structure characterization will also be utilized.",
