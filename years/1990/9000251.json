 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California is in the process of                      converting the tuna clipper OSPREY into a research vessel that                  will be named the R/V VICKERS. Funding for the purchase and                     conversion of the vessel has been supplied mainly from private                  sources. NSF will supply funds for one 10-day cruise aboard the                 vessel in 1990. This grant is for one year only.                                                                                                                This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects. Most                     oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members. An                  increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed. Such equipment also requires                     hightly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.                     These vessels do not operate in the same manner as general                      cargo or fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the                       operation of a variety of vessels specifically dedicated to                     oceanographic research. These vessels are operated by                           universities and research institutions around the country.",
