This is one of               eleven winners under that competition.                                          How to make decisions in the face of uncertainty is a core                      problem in many computer science and economic modelling problems.               However, there are a number of weaknesses in the traditional                    approaches to modelling knowledge.  Among them are assumption                   that there are perfect reasoners and that inferences can be based               on arbitrarily deep levels of knowledge.  This research on                      coordination theory is to develop a new notion of practical                     knowledge upon which to base coordinated decision making.                       Practical knowledge will take account of several factors which                  limit a reasoner's deductive ability such as computational                      resources available to the reasoner,  imperfections in the                      reasoner's ability to carry out correct deductions, and                         faultiness and incompleteness in the data available to the                      reasoner.  Many of these factors have been studied previously in                isolation.  This research extends and unifies such work in order                to come up with a comprehensive theory of sound reasoning in a                  practical multi-agent environment.",
