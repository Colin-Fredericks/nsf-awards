 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software will be developed that provides experimental control of                stimulus display and data acquisition in neurophysiological and                 psychophysical investigations of visual processing.  This software              is being developed for three main reasons: (1) to take advantage                of advances in computer technology that facilitate the development              of such systems, (2) to incorporate an extensive library of low-                level visual display drivers that have been developed at NYU over               the past five years, and (3) to incorporate modern design concepts              into the software.  The software is expected to provide the basic               experimental control program for the next 5-10 years for the                    research group involved in this proposal.  In addition, a key                   design feature of the software system is portability, with the goal             of freeing its general structure from dependance on a specific                  processor architecture or on a particular set of input and output               devices.                                                                                                                                                        The common theme of the research that will initially use the newly              developed software is that it relies upon computer controlled                   generation and display of visual patterns, either on monochrome or              color monitors along with the collection of stimulus-evoked                     behavioral and neural responses.  Although the initial effort will              concentrate on the generation of software for visual                            experimentation, the design of the system is by no means limited                to this area, and adaptation of the general control structures to               a wide range of neural and behavioral experiments should be                     straightforward.",
