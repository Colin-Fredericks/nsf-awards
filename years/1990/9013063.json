 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL) is the                    oldest cold-water marine laboratory in the eastern United States,               annually providing facilities for between 40 to 50 research                     programs ranging from the comparative physiology and biochemistry               of osmoregulation and renal and epithelial transport in                         vertebrates and invertebrates to endocrinology, developmental and               molecular biology.  Scientists throughout the world apply to work               at the MDIBL; acceptance is competitive.                                                                                                                        This project provides matching funds for the renovation of a                    sixty-seven year old building, the H. V. Neal Laboratory.                       Although continuously used for decades by researchers, including                some of the MDIBL's most illustrious summer scientists, the Neal                building no longer provides an adequate laboratory environment                  for modern electrophysiological, biochemical and molecular                      biology research.                                                                                                                                               Plans call for modernizing the building to provide climate-                     controlled research space with vibration-free floors.  The                      interior of the building will be modified to provide both                       laboratory and work space on two floors by the removal of present               interior partitions and the lowering of the first-floor ceiling.                Electrical service, lighting and plumbing also will be upgraded.                The exterior siding of the building, unchanged since original                   construction, will be replaced.  A new entrance will provide                    access for handicapped persons.  Renovation of the Neal                         Laboratory will increase by two-fold the area of temperature-                   controlled modern space for state-of-the-art research at the                    MDIBL.",
