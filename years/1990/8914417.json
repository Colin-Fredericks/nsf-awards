 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertebrates cannot synthesize and thus require a dietary                        source of linoleic acid, 18:2(n-6), which is used both as a                     structural component of membranes and as precursor for                          physiologically important eicosanoids.  Until recently, it                      had been thought that insects, as is the case for                               vertebrates, were unable to synthesize linoleic acid.                           Studies have demonstrated that some, but not all, insect                        species possess a delta-12 desaturase and are thus able to                      produce linoleic acid.  This proposal is designed to examine                    this synthesis of linoleic acid in the cockroach, Periplaneta                   americana, the aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and the cricket,                     Acheta domesticus.  Emphasis will be on studies designed to                     unambiguously rule out the contribution of microorganisms,                      both symbiotic and exterior, to linoleate synthesis, ie. that                   it is the insect tissue that is responsible for the                             desaturation of oleate to linoleate.  In addition, the form                     of the substrate for the delta-12 desaturase and the further                    elongation and desaturation of linoleic acid will be                            examined.  These studies will characterize the unique process                   by which certain insect species have gained a nutritional                       independence from dietary requirements for polyunsaturated                      fatty acids.  Significant fundamental knowledge of                              comparative lipid metabolism will be obtained from this work.                                                                                                   Linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid for vertebrates.  It                   is an important membrane component and serves as a precursor                    for hormone-like substances that regulate many cell                             functions.  Vertebrates lack the ability to synthesize                          linoleic acid and fulfill their dietary requirement by the                      consumption of plants, which, in addition to protozoa and                       fungi readily synthesize the fatty acid.  Until recently, it                    was thought that insects, like other animals, were unable to                    synthesize linoleic acid.  Recent evidence now suggests that                    insects do have this capability.  This research will examine                    this phenomenon.  It will provide a basic understanding of                      linoleic acid biosynthesis in insects and may have future                       implications for the exploitation of the insect-specific                        pathways of hormone regulation as a means of pest control.",
