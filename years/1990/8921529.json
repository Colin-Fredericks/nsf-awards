 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this investigation the researcher assesses how the modern,                   American democratic state is founded at the beginning of the                    twentieth century on the basis of legislative policies initiated at             the state and federal levels of government.  Grass-root referenda               votes are collected and used as a measure of constituency issue                 positions and are examined in relation to subsequent roll call voting           by House members on the same or similar issues.  The analysis of a              wide range of issues, including welfare, government management, and             civil rights policies, illustrates that House members' responses to             the cues of their constituents, mediated by partisan competition and            conflict, do have the effect of transferring progressive social                 policies first proposed and implemented at the state-level to that of           the federal-level.                                                                                                                                              While many view the New Deal as the beginning of the modern era,                this research reveals how the rich multitude of state-level                     legislation considered in the earlier part of this century provides             crucial precedents for modern, federal policy programs.  Not only do            we gain a better understanding of how Congress operates in these                decades, but the centrality of legislative and representative                   processes for the establishment of progressive policies is evident,             balancing the more usual attention directed to the role of courts and           parties in this time period.                                                                                                                                    In addition to integrating a relatively neglected time period, the              Progressive Era, into the study of Congress and development of our              modern state, this project also introduces a new method for studying            policy congruence in general between the state and federal levels by            means of grass.root referenda votes.  As a result of this research,             the applicability of using referenda votes in studies of                        contemporary congresses will be apparent, thereby opening up new                perspectives for investigating policy connections between state and             federal levels.",
