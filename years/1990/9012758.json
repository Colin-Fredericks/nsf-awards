 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides travel and expenses for several invited                     scientists and scholars to present papers at the First World                    Congress of Biomechanics, in San Diego, Friday, August 31.  These               papers will form the core of a mini-symposium on \"Ethical Issues                in Bioengineering,\" and cover topics such as:  allocation of scarce             resources, clinical trials of new devices and implants, conflict                of interest, and human and animal experimentation.  Bioengineers                face medical ethics problems, but they are not often exposed to                 training in the principles and issues of biomedical ethics.  Nor                is much of the material in this area focused in a way that                      addresses their concerns directly.  These speakers will provide an              important initial resource to develop this field.  The talks will               be published in a special issue of the journal Annals of Biomedical             Engineering.                                                                                                                                                    The proposal focuses on an important area; the principal                        investigator and invited speakers are very well qualified; the                  modest funds that are requested should stimulate initial attention              to ethical issues for bioengineering and, through publication,                  provide a long-term resource for the field.  Support is highly                  recommended.",
