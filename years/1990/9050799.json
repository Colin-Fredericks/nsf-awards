 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve the education of undergraduate                    industrial engineers in the effective management of productivity.               Productivity management encompasses the classical industrial                    engineering (IE) activities of work measurement, motion study, methods          improvement and work simplification, coupled with the consideration of          human factors.  As with most technical fields, improvement in the               practice of these IE basics can result from technological advances in           the equipment used.  No longer is it sufficient to arm an IE with               paper, pencil, and a stopwatch.  This project offers the IE student an          opportunity to gain experience with an array of today's sophisticated           tools, including automated data collection and analysis systems,                computer interfaces, and videotape technology.  These tools enhance the         IE's own productivity.  This experience combined with the underlying            theory of productivity management better prepares the student to                effectively manage productivity in the workplace.                                                                                                               The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
