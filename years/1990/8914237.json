 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frequent reference is made in the scholarly literature of                  geography and related fields to the ways in which decision making at a          specific site is influenced not only be the characteristics of that             site but also by the relationships between that site and other sites,           but most analyses of these relationships have been anecdotal and                descriptive in nature.  This doctoral dissertation research project             will systematically analyze how proximity to urban markets affects              decisions by Philippine peasant farmers to make investments to increase         soil productivity.  The hypothesis will be tested that the relationship         between investments and market proximity is U-shaped, with maximal              investments made at locations that are either close to or far from              urban centers, while lower levels of investment are made at                     intermediate distances.  Information from a survey of 225 farm                  households an analyses of soil samples from fields will be used to              determine how proximity to markets and other factors has affected               decisions about which crops were planted and what investments were made         to improve soil productivity.                                                        This project will provide specific means to analyze the potential          utility of policies aimed at simultaneously encouraging economic                development and maintaining soil quality, but it will have an even more         significant impact as a means of distinguishing how characteristics of          specific sites are evaluated with respect to relationships with other           sites as farmers make locational decisions.  The research project also          will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising graduate student          to expand and refine her basic research skills.",
