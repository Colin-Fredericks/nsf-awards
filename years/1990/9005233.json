 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volvox carteri is a potentially powerful model for analyzing the                genetic control of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis.                  Each individual contains two entirely different cell types that                 exhibit a complete division of labor between vegetative and                     reproductive functions, and that are arranged in a highly regular               pattern within a simple spheroid.  Because the organism is haploid              and reproduces rapidly in the asexual cycle, individuals possessing             mutations affecting key developmental processes are readily                     isolated, and grown into large, genetically homogeneous                         populations.  But because the organism can be switched from asexual             to sexual reproduction at will, formal genetic analysis is also                 possible.  Our objective is to make the genetic linkage map of                  Volvox more useful for future developmental- and molecular-genetic              studies, by extending it to include additional drug-resistance                  markers, restriction fragment length polymorphisms and                          rearrangement breakpoints.  And, as a major step toward elucidating             the genetic programs that regulate differentiation of reproductive              cells, we will attempt to identify and map all of the loci at which             mutations either result in a breakdown of the division of labor                 between somatic and reproductive cells, or result in constitutive               sexual reproduction.                                                                                                                                            Volvox bridges the gap between single-celled chlamydomonas, and                 multicellular higher plants.  Therefore, basic studies of Volvox                are important in evolutionary and developmental studies.***//",
