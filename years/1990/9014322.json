 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics program will support Professor Paul Dowd's                 study of \"Synthesis of Vitamin K Models\" in the Chemistry                       Department at the University of Pittsburgh.  Vitamin K is                       required for blood clotting, where it is an essential cofactor                  in the complex enzymic sequence known as the blood clotting                     cascade.   This study will explore a new experimental model for                 the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation reaction since in the                     absence of carboxylation blood clotting is inhibited.                                                                                                           A variety of methods are being used to study the new                            experimental model for the vitamin K-dependent carboxylation                    reaction, including inter- and intramolecular condensation                      reactions, oxygen labelling experiments, exploration of new                     strong bases, and new oxygenation reactions.  Model experiments                 will determine whether molecular oxygen triggers the                            carboxylation reaction  by reacting with the anionic form of                    vitamin K hydroquinone to produce vitamin K oxide, whose                        formation provides the energy necessary to furnish a base                       sufficiently strong to effect carboxylation.",
