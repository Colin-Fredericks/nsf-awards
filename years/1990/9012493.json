 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to investigate                the reciprocal interactions and the dynamic effects of social                   class upon school practices through a cross cultural comparison of              the knowledge transmission process in early 20th century                        elementary schools of Buffalo.  The main hypothesis is that class               was a greater factor than ethnicity or race in the schooling                    process.  During the planning stages, the PI will identify and                  study southern-born white and black immigrants to the city and                  study the shifts which occurred within these two populations                    between 1910 and 1930.  Having established their resettlement                   patterns in the city by social class, the PI will determine the                 elementary schools in which their children enrolled.  Locating                  their schools would allow to investigate the responses of the                   public elementary schools to the children of immigrant                          populations.  The PI also plans to analyze the content of articles              published in the widely circulated School Magazine between 1918-                1932.  Through a systematic analysis, the investigator expects to               show similarities and differences in the types of school knowledge              transmitted to the pupil populations under study.",
