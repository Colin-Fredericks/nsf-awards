 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is on the interrelationship between                   photosynthetic carbon assimilation and nitrogen fixation in a                   cyanobacterium, Synechococcus.  Dr. Spiller plans to examine the                uptake and kinetics of carbon assimilation in the organisms and                 the effect of carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors on bicarbonate                      utilization.  It is also planned to examine the mechanism of                    oxygen exchange, using glucose in light and dark, and bicarbonate               under photosynthetic conditions.  The use and availability of                   glucose as compared to carbon dioxide to support nitrogen                       fixation will be examined.  Experiments are also planned in which               use is made of energy-transfer inhibitors in order to examine the               role played by the electrochemical potential of protons in                      dark:light transients of N-fixing Synechococcus cells.                                                                                                          The cyanobacteria are structurally simple organisms, often                      unicellular and often free-living, which have a remarkable                      ability to make use of the nitrogen gas in the environment in a                 manner that higher animals and plants cannot do.  These bacteria,               like most plants, are capable of harnessing radiant energy in the               form of sunlight and producing organic carbon-containing                        compounds by photosynthesis.  Inorganic carbon is taken in and                  chemically manipulated to provide appropriate carbon compounds                  that can combine with newly fixed nitrogen.  The photosynthetic                 process involves high rates of oxygen production, and this is a                 potential problem for the cyanobacteria because the enzymes that                fix nitrogen are highly sensitive to oxygen.  Dr. Spiller's                     project makes use of a simple cyanobacterium that is well suited                for attempting to understand in detail how carbon metabolism and                nitrogen metabolism are united in a successful partnership in                   this organism.",
