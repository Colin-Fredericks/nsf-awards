 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gel electrophoresis has been used to fractionate macromolecules for             studies in all fields of biochemistry and biophysics.  To                       understand mechanisms of sieving during gel electrophoresis, the                PIs have previously qualified sieving and tested several models of              sieving by gels.  Two models, one based on sterics and one and                  based on hydrodynamics, have survived these tests.  During previous             studies, sieving for spheres with radii between 5 and 500 nm has                been qualified; an analysis of the sieving of rods has been                     started; the structure of gels has been investigated.  The                      objectives of the present proposal are to: (1) determine the model              that most accurately describes the sieving of spheres during gel                electrophoresis; video light microscopy (phase contrast and                     fluorescent) of individual spheres undergoing gel electrophoresis               will be performed; (2) determine how sieving depends on the                     structure of the gel used for electrophoresis; sieving will be                  quantified by use of procedures of gel electrophoresis previously               developed by the PIs; the structure of gels will be determined in               part by use of electron microscopy and computer-assisted image                  processing; (3) determine the effect on sieving of the dimensions               and flexibility of rod-shaped particles; for this purpose, one of               the PIs' procedures of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis will be              used; (4) obtain and organize for rapid access a catalogue of                   conditions appropriate for sieving-based separation and                         characterization of particles with effective radii as small as 1-               2 nm and as large as 5-10 nm.  The research proposed will                       contribute to the understanding of motion through porous networks               in both biological  and non-biological systems.  This research will             also increase the capacity for rapid and inexpensive biophysical                characterization of particles that need not be purified.",
