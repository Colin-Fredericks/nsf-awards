 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research on the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster, has three            objectives:  1) to test the Charnov.Finerty (1980) hypothesis, which            proposed that differences in genetic relatedness at high versus low             population densities drives vole population cycles: 2) to determine             whether the proximate mechanism of this hypothesis is genetic                   relatedness per se, or familiarity (as suggested by Bekoff 1981); 3)            to determine whether either degree of genetic relatedness or                    familiarity influences the mating system under field conditions.  By            manipulating matings and housing conditions in the laboratory, four             populations of varying degrees of genetic relatedness and familiarity           will be created:  Kin-Familiar, Kin-Unfamiliar, Non Kin-Familiar,               Non-Kin Unfamiliar.  These populatins will be released into four field          enclosures and live-trapped every two weeks.  Wounding (as a measure            of aggression), dispersal rates, reproductive condition, population             numbers and spacing patterns will be monitored.  DNA fingerprinting             will be used to determine reproductive success and mating system                in each enclosure.                                                                The interactive component consists of teaching a graduate seminar             on women animal behaviorists, organizing a discussion group for women           students and faculty, organizing a symposium on women and science,              and presenting a department seminar.                                              This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
