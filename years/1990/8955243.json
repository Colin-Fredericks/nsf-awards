 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with a five county consortium of school districts                       served by the Southwest Florida Teacher Education Center                        (SWFTEC) in Ft. Meyers, the Florida Institute of Oceanography                   (FIO) proposes a two year program of seminar/workshops,                         research vessel experience and field exercises designed to                      translate the strongly multidisciplinary nature and                             excitement of oceanography into enhanced understanding and                      teaching skills in the basic sciences and mathematics.  Later                   sessions of the program will stress the application of                          scientific principles in coastal management and will involve                    community and state leaders.  The content and activities are                    tied to the Florida Department of Education Curriculum                          framework.                                                                                                                                                      Beginning in the summer of 1990, thirty teachers from the                       five county area will act as lead teachers, translating with                    the aid of the professional staff of SWFTEC, the program                        content into pedagogical techniques, lesson plans and teacher                   aids that will be presented in a series of teacher led                          workshops in the school districts. An emphasis will be placed                   on continuing teacher access to the many scientists in                          Florida's public and private research institutions.  Through                    the lead teacher network, the program will be exported to                       other school districts in the state through inservice teacher                   training and workshops.  Participants may earn five graduate                    credit hours per semester.                                                                                                                                      All of the participant's salaries during the regular school                     year and, through FIO, the Florida Department of Education,                     and private funding, the entire cost of the academic,                           oceanographic and Keys facility field activities are cost                       shared.                                                                                                                                                         The cost sharing in an amount of $332,792 equals 90% of the                     NSF award.",
