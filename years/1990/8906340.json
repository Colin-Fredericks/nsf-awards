 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bamboos, often known as the tree grasses, are an                           ecologically and economically important group of primarily                      tropical plants.  The tall, graceful plume-like stems of bamboo                 are a familiar element of any tropical scene, but bamboos are                   actually very diverse in size, form, and habitat.  In addition to               the typical \"giant\" bamboos, some species are very grass-like                   with relatively soft stems, while others are vines or shrubs.                   Many bamboos grow in or near the tropical lowland forest, but                   many species can be found in high montane forests, with some                    species occurring at high elevations on windswept ridges.  Some                 hardy bamboos grow in the temperate zone and can survive frost                  and snow.  Although there are approximately 1000 species of                     bamboos in the world, most have not been studied intensively                    because of their size and the difficulty in collecting them.                         Dr. Lynn Clark of Iowa State University will study a group                 of 30 or so species of viny bamboos native to South America,                    mostly in Brazil.  Although these species have little current                   economic use, they are common in the lower montane forests of                   eastern Brazil and are ecologically important.  The first step                  will be the observation and collection of these plants in the                   field, aided by collaborating Brazilian students and researchers.               Pressed and dried specimens, and leaves and flowers preserved in                liquid, will be taken back to the laboratory for the second step,               involving detailed comparative studies of morphology, cytology,                 and anatomy.  Once the data are assembled, a complete description               of each species will be prepared, along with geographical                       distribution data and notes on habitat and flowering and fruiting               behavior.  The third step of the study involves a higher level of               analysis, in which the evolutionary relationships among these                   bamboo species are explored by searching for consistent patterns                of unique biological similarities.  The results of this project                 will have application for those interested in the inventory,                    conservation, and ecology of native American bamboos, the                       economic potential of bamboos, and the diversity and evolution of               grasses.",
