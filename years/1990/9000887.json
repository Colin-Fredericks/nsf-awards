 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Microbiology Department of the                 University of Texas at Austin to continue their REU site Program                designed to introduce gifted undergraduates into on-going                       productive Cell and Molecular Biology research programs.                        Participants will be actively recruited nationwide, but emphasis                will be given to undergraduates who would not otherwise have the                opportunity for original research, especially women and minority                students.  Students will have access to well-funded and equipped                labs in which the research covers both prokaryotic and eukaryotic               systems and deals with:  membrane structure and transport, DNA                  replication, site-specific recombination, gene expression and                   developmental control, immunological mechanisms, pathogenic                     mechanisms and viral transformation.  Participants will work                    individually with faculty mentors but have access to all faculty                through seminars and informal discussions.  Follow-up procedures                will promote interest in research careers and encourage students                to apply to graduate schools in cell and molecular biology.  UT                 Austin makes a strong commitment to this Program, including support             for a dedicated program coordinator and provision of room, board,               travel and fees for minority participants.",
