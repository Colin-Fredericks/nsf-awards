 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will track recent public policy responses to                       biotechnology in Britain, West Germany and the United States.  In               all three countries, biotechnology has now progressed from the                  research laboratory into the marketplace, creating a demand for new             policies and giving rise to new controversies and political                     alliances.  The project will compare three areas of parallel policy             development in the chosen countries:  controls on field-testing of              genetically engineered microorganisms, regulation of fetal and                  embryo research, and patenting of genetically engineered life                   forms.  Through a combination of literature reviews, analysis of                legal and policy initiatives, and interviews, the project will                  identify the major actors, instruments and outcomes that comprise               the \"new\" politics of biotechnology and will analyze the values                 underlying different national policy choices.  The project will                 generate new empirical information about a significant area of                  science and technology policy.  The comparative research will                   facilitate the testing of important hypotheses about science,                   technology and political choice, such as claims about technological             determinism and the social construction of technology.  By                      including a comparative approach and attention to hypotheses of                 interest in several different science, technology and society                   research fields, the research will also provide a methodological                alternative to the study of single cases and controversies which                currently predominates.  Results are expected to include a book,                a number of articles for a variety of audiences, and presentations              at scholarly and other meetings, and will enrich courses and                    programs at the investigator's university.                                                                                                                      Studies in Science, Technology and Society supports research                    projects and related activities that promise to improve our                     understanding of the intellectual and value contexts that influence             the development and use of science and technology.  This project                focuses on an important, continuing episode of interactions among               science, technology and society.  The research plan is solid, and               provides an important comparative perspective.  The principal                   investigator is a productive scholar who is uniquely qualified to               undertake the research.  Results promise to be very useful to a                 wide range of audiences.  Therefore, the project is recommended for             support.",
