 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project focuses on two areas related to the                   study of solutions of elliptic partial differential equations.                  These are the analysis of the biharmonic and polyharmonic                       equations on non-smooth domains and boundary value problems for                 second order elliptic divergence form operators with non-smooth                 coefficients.                                                                        In past work it was discovered that the range of solvability               of higher order elliptic operators on non-smooth domains depended               on the dimension of the underlying domain.  There remains a gap                 in the range in which the solution will have a finite norm (above               the quadratic).  If the domain has dimension four or greater then               solutions exist with unbounded p-norms for some value of p                      greater than two.  But the first value of p is not known, nor is                it known whether this gap reduces to zero as the dimension                      increases.  Work will be done in an effort to obtain sharp                      estimates on this range.                                                             There is a close connection between the study of                           differential operators on non-smooth domains and those with                     non-smooth coefficients.  Research will concentrate on                          establishing representations of solutions through integrals of                  boundary values.  This is a particularly delicate matter.  In the               case of smooth coefficient operators, the integrals are Lebesgue                integrals (the harmonic measure is absolutely continuous with                   respect to surface measure).  This is not necessarily the case in               general.  Work will be done in establishing criteria which will                 still guarantee the integral representation through approximation               procedures.  Once these are established, one can then begin to                  study the behavior of solutions as the variable is made to                      approach the domain boundary.",
