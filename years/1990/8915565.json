Every                                   case history such as this one has the                                           potential for revealing new or unexpected                                       phenomena which could qualitatively change                                      the thinking about earthquake effects.                                                                                                                          The research activities focus on three areas                                    of interest: (1) analysis of ground motion,                                     (2) site effects upon ground motions and                                        building damages, and (3) other geotechnical                                    aspects including liquefaction, slopes,                                         highway and railway embankments, retaining                                      walls, and pipelines.                                                                                                                                           The major contributions of this research are                                    expected to include: (1) A comprehensive                                        documentation of case history data that will                                    be useful in geotechnical earthquake                                            engineering research and practice, (2)                                          Evaluation of the applicability and/or                                          validity of current analytical procedures                                       used in geotechnical earthquake engineering,                                    and (3) Enhancement of current knowledge and                                    understanding of near- and far-field ground                                     motions and their effects on soils and                                          structures.",
