 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence,                nature and timing of pre-Middle Jurassic convergence-related                    metamorphism in accreted terranes of the south-central Klamath                  Mountains of northern California.                                                    A number of elongate, tectonometamorphic accreted terranes                 comprising the western Paleozoic and Triassic belt (WPzTr)                      contain abundant evidence of low-P/T metamorphism related to                    combined regional shortening and magmatic heating which occurred                during Middle and Late Jurassic evolution of an really widespread               continental-margin magmatic arc at the western edge of North                    America.  One of the WpzTr terranes, the Stuart Fork, also                      contains evidence of an earlier pre-mid-Jurassic metamorphism                   related to subduction along a convergent margin, preserved as                   distinctive high-P/T blueschist metamorphic assemblages that are                partly obscured within younger plutonic aureoles.  Other terranes               in the southern WPzTr contain poorly documented low-grade                       metamorphic mineral assemblages which are not easily attributed                 to particular metamorphic conditions, geothermal gradients or                   tectonic environments.                                                               The goal of this study is to conduct a detailed petrologic                 and thermochronlogic investigation of pre-Middle Jurassic                       metamorphism and deformation within these southern WPzTr                        terranes.  Integrated field, petrologic and geochronologic data                 will help to constrain the origin, evolution and tectonic                       environment of these terranes prior to their assembly in mid-                   Jurassic time.  These data will also be employed to model their                 accretion to the continental margin, and to address and                         unresolved problem of whether the early Mesozoic margin of the                  central Cordillera evolved as a single, diachronous subduction                  boundary, or as a system of parallel, perhaps, coeval, subduction               zones.                                                                               This integrated study will employ standard optical                         microscopy, detailed electron microprobe analysis (including                    back-scattered electron imagining), and XRD analysis.  These                    methods are particularly well-suited to the study of low-grade                  metamorphic rocks.  In addition, chronological and thermal-                     history constraints will be provided by 40Ar/39Ar age-dating in                 collaboration with Dr. Paul R. Renne of Princeton University.  We               plan to conduct this investigation over a period of two years,                  including two summer field seasons.",
