 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in electrical                    engineering between Dr. Ting-Wei Tang, University of Massachusetts              and Professor Erik Kollberg, Department of Applied Electron                     Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, Goteburg, Sweden.                   The project will focus on the study of excess noise in GaAS                     Schottky-barrier diodes, designed for millimeter waves and mixers.                                                                                              Solid experimental evidence on the existence of excess noise in                 millimeter wave diodes related to hot electron effects has been                 collected by Chalmers research group.  This group has competence                in both the fabrication of GaAs millimeter wave diodes and noise                measurements from frequencies of a few hundred MHz to about a                   hundred GHz.  However, a theoretical understanding of the diode                 noise characteristics versus bias current is generally lacking.                 The University of Massachusetts group is well-known for its                     numerical modeling of hot-electron and other effects in semicon-                ductor devices. The proposed research will aim at: l) a detailed                theoretical model (to be developed utilizing the numerical                      modeling expertise available at the University of Massachusetts),               and  2) an experimental verification (using Swedish expertise on                fabricating high quality Schottky diodes).  The results of this                 project are expected to lead to improved designs of low-noise                   Schottky-barrier diodes for millimeter wave application.",
