 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfields of              organometallic chemistry and physical organic chemistry.  The long              range scientific goals of this research are to increase                         understanding of the correlation of molecular structure with                    physical properties of ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) phases,               and to test strategies for the design of new materials.                         Specifically, this research is aimed at inventing new FLC                       materials having low birefringence and low absorption at UV                     wavelengths.  Such FLC materials would have application in flat                 panel displays and spatial light modulators (SLMs) for UV light.                                                                                                Ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C* liquid crystals have been shown               to exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display device              applications, particularly when incorporated into the surface                   stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal (SSFLC) light valve.  Flat              panel displays based upon the SSFLC device concept have many                    potential advantages.  However, due to the high birefringence and               large UV absorption of existing materials, SSFLC light valves                   prove problematical in some important applications.  Both of these              problems are due to the fact that all known FLC materials possess               aromatic rings in the liquid crystal core.  The specific goal of                this Phase I activity is to design, synthesize, and evaluate new                FLC materials with saturated cores.  The specific core structures               to be explored include novel cubylcubanes, and cubane units                     combined with bicyclo\u01312.2.2!octane units.",
