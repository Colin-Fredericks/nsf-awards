 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bighorn Basin of Wyoming has a richly fossiliferous                    sedimentary sequence of Eocene age.  It has yielded an                          extraordinarily dense record of vertebrate fossils, most of                     which are teeth, jaws, or more rarely, skulls.  This has left                   open the question of how the these mammals functioned                           ecologically (locomotion being the primary question).  The Eocene               was a time interval in which the modern families of vertebrates                 were becoming differentiated, so a better understanding of their                locomotion would be particularly valuable.  Dr. Kenneth Rose has                devoted years of effort to making detailed fossil collections                   that document these evolutionary events.  He proposes to continue               his efforts to collect new post-cranial remains, and to use these               and existing collections in an analysis of function and behavior.               Dr. Rose will use the most current approaches to studying the                   shapes and functions of fossil bone, including microcomputer-                   based image analysis as well as statistical comparisons with                    living mammals.                                                                      The proposed research will attract an audience beyond                      vertebrate paleontologists interested in the Eocene.                            Mammalogists and functional morphologists will gain new insight                 into the early functional repertoire of mammalian families, and                 evolutionary biologists will take interest in the process by                    which new functional complexes arise in radiating families.",
