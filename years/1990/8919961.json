 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the brain to operate correctly, the connections among nerve                 cells must be appropriate.  During embryological development,                   some of these \"synaptic\" connections may be made because the                    cells  are genetically pre-programmed to make them.  In other                   cases, however, the synaptic inputs to a nerve cell may influence               which other cells it, in turn, contacts. A knowledge of how                     peripheral targets can influence synaptic connections in the                    brain is basic to an understanding of how nerve cells originally                make and then refine and maintain their proper connections.                                                                                                     Synaptic connections in the spinal cord between sensory and motor               nerve cells innervating muscles, the simple knee-jerk reflex,                   provide an excellent experimental system for studying this                      problem at the level of single nerve cells.  In the spinal cord,                these connections initially form with a high degree of                          specificity.  However, if a  group of sensory cells is forced to                innervate a different target during development, the synaptic                   connections formed within the spinal cord are appropriate for                   this new target.                                                                                                                                                The experiments in this grant are designed to explore, using                    anatomical and microelectrode recording techniques, the following               questions:  When, during development, is a nerve cell specified                 to have a particular function?  To what extent is this function                 determined by the previous history of the cell (its lineage)                    versus its present molecular environment?  These studies should                 provide useful information concerning how synapses are made                     during normal development and even how they might be repaired                   after spinal injury.",
