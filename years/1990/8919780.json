 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to continue molecular,                     genetic and biochemical analyses of the char-1 gene complex from                the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  Char-1 is the                        structural gene for choline acetyltransferase, the enzyme which                 synthesizes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  Previously                     obtained evidence suggests that the choline acetyltransferase                   protein in C. elegans may consists of multiple structural and                   functional domains, and there is interest in determining the                    organization of the gene and the structure of the protein.  In                  addition, investigations on the spatial and temporal control of                 choline acetyltransferase will be performed during neural                       development.  C. elegans is being used for these studies because                of its simple nervous system, its ease of genetic analysis, and                 the availability of the technique of \"transposon tagging\" to                    clone genes from this organism.  This recent approach has been                  utilized to \"tag\" and clone part of the cha-1 complex.                          Antibodies directed against specific regions of the choline                     acetyltransferase molecule will be isolated.  The isolated                      regions will be used in biochemical studies of choline                          acetyltransferase structure and in anatomical studies to analyze                the development of acetylcholine-utilizing neurons.  The                        information obtained about the normal gene and enzyme will be                   used to analyze mutants defective in neural structure and                       neurotransmitter function.",
