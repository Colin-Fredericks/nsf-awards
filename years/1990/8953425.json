 "awd_abstract_narration": "READING RAINBOW, produced by Nebraskans for Public television/Great             Plains National ITV Library, is a fifty part continuing PBS children's          television series which entices children ages five through eight to read        good books.  The present project seeks to integrate quality science             books into their nationally successful PBS series, thus encouraging             children's interest in science and making science books more visible.           Six science programs have been produced with prior NSF support; this            award will support the production of nine additional half hour READING          RAINBOW programs with scientific themes that will become an integral            part of the on-going series.  A special promotional effort will also be         funded to reach early elementary teachers who have not yet discovered           Reading Rainbow programs.                                                                                                                                       Targeted at five to eight years olds, READING RAINBOW receives heavy in-        school use as well as at-home viewing.  It is carried by virtually all          PBS affiliates, reaching 95% of the nation's households and 8 million           series viewers.  In addition to receiving all major children's                  television awards, READING RAINBOW has demonstrated both increased              summer reading and increased requests by title for the books reviewed.          The opportunity for increasing attention to science books for early             readers is outstanding.  NSF support is 31% of the total budgeted; the          remainder will be provided by the Kellog Company, the Corporation for           Public Broadcasting, and by PBS station.",
