 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan will operate the R/V LAURENTIAN                      during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of                     NSF-funded research projects.  The LAURENTIAN is a 80' general                  research vessel constructed in 1974.  It is owned by the                        University of Michigan.                                                                                                                                         This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.                                                                                                                       The R/V LAURENTIAN is a capable vessel for the work proposed.                   The program considers the ship an important part of the fleet due               to its location.  The LAURENTIAN is the only NSF-funded vessel                  that operates in the Great Lakes, and the University of Michigan                should be encouraged to improve usage of the vessel.",
