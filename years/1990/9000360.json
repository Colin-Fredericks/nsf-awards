 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the further development of the use                of Nuclear Magnetic resonance (NMR) for studies of the 3                        dimensional structure of proteins and nucleic acids in solution.                The approach developed by Gorenstein and his colleagues, the hybrid             matrix/complete relaxation matrix program (or MORASS), has proven               highly productive.  Planned work should increase the accuracy and               ease of application of these techniques.                                        Determination of the three dimensional structure of biopolymers                 such as proteins and nucleic acids, and its relationship to the                 biological function of the polymers, is a central problem in modern             biology.  The most successful approach to the study of large                    molecules like proteins has come with the use of crystallographic               methods.  These methods, however, are limited to study of the                   highly ordered structures found in crystals; the results may or may             not be directly applicable to the structure of (active) molecules               in solution.  Many investigators now see the use of NMR as the most             promising approach to studies of the solution structure of a                    variety of biomolecules.  However, further refinement of                        experimental techniques and the analytical tools needed for                     interpretation of the spectroscopic data is crucial to progress in              the application of this powerful tool.",
