 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global warming is due in part to the increasing amounts of                      carbon dioxide(CO2) being introduced into the atmosphere from                   the burning of both solid and liquid fuels.  New economically                   viable technologies which utilize CO2 as a chemical feedstock                   for the synthesis of useful products are needed.  This CO2                      would be readily available, for example from the exhausts of                    fossil fuel burning power plants.  This Phase II Small                          Business Innovation Research  project is directed towards the                   identification of optimum conditions for achieving both high                    Faradaic efficiencies and current densities for the direct                      electrochemical reduction of CO2 to alcohols.                                                                                                                   Specifically, work will be performed using perovskite based                     electrocatalysts incorporated within gas diffusion electrodes                   where they will provide sites for CO2 intermediates leading to                  alcohol synthesis.  Research objectives will include: (1) the                   systematic selection of perovskite electrocatalysts based upon                  their surface oxide bond strengths and corresponding activity                   for promoting alcohol synthesis, (2) the performance of an in-                  depth electrochemical study for perovskite electrocatalyst                      optimization, (3) optimization of component fabrication                         procedures and electrochemical conditions for operating                         perovskite containing gas diffusion electrodes under high CO2                   pressure, and (4) fabrication of prototype electrolytic cells                   incorporating optimum gas diffusion electrode designs and                       perform extended electrolyses for promoting CO2 reduction to                    alcohols.",
