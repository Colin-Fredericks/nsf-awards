 "awd_abstract_narration": "Apatite, magnesian calcite, and silica are, along with                     clays, the most abundant phases in marine sediments.  Knowledge                 of the physical and chemical properties of magnesian calcites is                necessary if we are to understand their biogenic production, the                carbonate cements in the marine environment, the role of                        magnesian calcites in the CO2 budget of the earth, and their fate               during diagenesis.  Apatite stabilities and reaction rates in                   solution are needed because of the importance of apatite in the                 sedimentary cycle of phosphorus, in the formation of phosphorite                deposits, and in controlling the fertility of the ocean.                        Stability and reaction rate data on silica will help to explain                 the series of modifications silica undergoes during diagenesis,                 and help to define the role of silica in the sedimentary cycle.                 Unfortunately, previous investigations in these systems have                    failed to produce universally accepted models of their                          stabilities, partly because of the inadequacy of materials used                 in stability and kinetic experiments.                                                A thorough understanding of the chemistry and solid solution               nature of synthetic samples is necessary before the stabilities                 and solution behavior of natural phases can be evaluated.  Our                  approach is to compare the characteristics of homogeneous, well-                crystallized synthetic phases to natural materials.  We will                    extend our previous measurements on magnesian calcites to span                  the composition range of natural samples.  We will also extend                  our syntheses to apatite and opal.  Stability determinations will               be made throughout a temperature range corresponding to                         diagenetic conditions.  SEM, x-ray, electron microprobe, Raman,                 and IR analyses of both synthetic and natural samples will                      provide a basis for interpretation of the solution behavior of                  these minerals, and thus their reactions in the natural                         environment.",
