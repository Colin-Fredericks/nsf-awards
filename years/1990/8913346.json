 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mammalian cells grown in culture excrete a toxic byproduct,                     ammonia, that accumulates in quantities that limit cell                         growth and reduce product synthesis.  The usual tactics for                     limiting the effects of ammonia accumulation are                                uneconomical, requiring large amounts of media and high                         capital costs.                                                                                                                                                  In Phase I of this project, a novel membrane process was                        demonstrated that rapidly and irreversibly removes ammonia                      to well below inhibitory levels.  It was further                                demonstrated that media treated via this membrane process                       can be reused in the culturing of mammalian cells.  The                         savings in capital and operating costs offered by the                           membrane process are substantial, and the estimated payback                     period for the process is less than 30 days.                                                                                                                    In Phase II, work will be concentrated on determining the                       performance of the membrane process under long-term use and                     on integrating the membrane with a cell-culture reactor.                        It is also proposed to investigate coating small particles                      with the membrane developed in Phase I for use in removing                      ammonia from cell-culture media in small-scale applications.                    In pursuit of the Phase II goals, a collaboration has been                      arranged with a major pharmaceutical company, which will                        test the membrane system on an operating cell-culture                           reactor.  The information gained in this test will provide                      information vital to the commercialization of the process                       in Phase III.",
