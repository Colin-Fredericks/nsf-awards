 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support to the Department of Biology             at Hope College to carry on with the Research Experience for                    Undergraduates Site that was established in 1988. The program will              provide ten undergraduate students with an in-depth summer                      experience in research in environmental biology.  In order to                   provide research opportunities to individuals who are not well                  represented in science, the department will recruit women and                   members of minority groups to participate in the program with the               goal of having at least 50% of the student participants being women             and 50% being members of minority groups.  Five students from Hope              College and five students from other schools will be selected for               participation on the basis of academic record, research ability and             potential, professional objectives, independence and initiative.                Students will select a research project from five different areas               related to environmental biology:  1) Molecular Biology of Nitrogen             Fixation, 2) Environmental Biochemistry and Physiology, 3) Genetic              Toxicology, 4) Plant and Animal Parasitology and 5) Ecology and                 Systematics and will work under the supervision of twelve Ph.D                  faculty members.  Students will perform independent research                    projects, give oral presentations on their work in progress, and                prepare a research poster and research paper summarizing their                  work.",
