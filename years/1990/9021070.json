This meeting is to be held at the                                      University of Chile in Santiago, with a                                         tentative date of January 6-10, 1992.                                           Specifically, this action is to provide                                         travel support for Professor Chaim Poran of                                     the University of North Carolina at Charlotte                                   to meet with Prof. Eugenio Retamal in                                           Santiago, Chile, to begin planning for this                                     workshop.                                                                                                                                                       This region of Chile is seismically very                                        active, and historically and in recent times                                    (1985) it has been subjected to large                                           damaging earthquakes.  The motivation for                                       this meeting is to forge and maintain                                           contacts between the U.S. and Chile.                                            Following the 1985 earthquake, collaborative                                    research projects were initiated to assist                                      geotechnical engineers in Chile and the                                         United States of learn from that event.  This                                   workshop will continue and enhance that                                         collaboration; it will assist with the                                          development of preparedness plans for the                                       next major earthquake in Chile; and it will                                     enable researchers in the United States to be                                   in a position to learn from that event.",
