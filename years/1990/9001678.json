 "awd_abstract_narration": "Structure and dynamics of polymer-based glasses are studied below               the glass-transition temperature with a combination of                          spectroscopy, theory, and polymer science.  This approach                       operates at the interface of physical chemistry and material                    science to utilize molecular information to account for observed                bulk properties.  Nuclear magnetic resonance, the tool utilized                 in this investigation, probes structure and motion at the level                 of chemical groups which is then related to the macroscopic or                  bulk material properties of the multicomponent glasses.  Local                  intermolecular structure in these amorphous materials is                        determined by carbon-13 spin diffusion experiments, while                       molecular reorientation is monitored with spin relaxation and                   line shape experiments.  Rapid development of NMR experiments and               instrumentation continues to offer new avenues for the study of                 solids which will provide a level of insight not attainable a few               years ago.  Quantitative interpretational models are developed                  which link the spectroscopic data to mechanical and thermal                     response as well as such technologically relevant materials                     behaviour as plasticization and permeability.  The particular                   multicomponent glasses, polycarbonates and their mixtures, are                  selected for study as the result of their interesting and                       important materials properties.  The interpretational efforts are               also tied to the development of theory.  The use of lattice                     models to interpret polymer-diluent structure and dynamics as                   well as mobilityof sorbed gas is a case in point.  Simulation and               modeling are used to assist in the development of physically                    sensible interpretational models.",
