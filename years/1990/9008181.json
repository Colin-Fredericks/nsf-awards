 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Charles Stanish                   will conduct archeological survey work in the Lake Titicaca Basin               of Southern Peru.  The research focuses on the Lupaqa, a                        prehistoric group which survived into early historic times and                  was described in Spanish chronicles.  The Lupaqa consist of a                   distinct, spatially limited, regional group which maintained its                identity although it was conquered by and incorporated into                     successive Tiwanaku and Inca empires.  Based on his prior work in               the region, Dr. Stanish will conduct a surface survey.  He will                 locate and map Lupaqa sites, and on the basis of surface                        materials recovered, assign these to appropriate time periods.                  The nature of the extent and configuration of surface remains                   will permit a good deal of inference about site organization and                function.                                                                                                                                                       Archaeologists wish to understand how large complex entities such               as empires expand and maintain their control over subject                       populations.  There is much disagreement about the extent to                    which direct force of arms is involved and the strategies used                  not only to establish but also to maintain power.  Because the                  Lupaqa constitute such a \"marginal\" group and because they were                 consecutively incorporated into two such kingdoms they provide an               excellent context in which to examine this issue.                                                                                                               The research is important for several reasons.  The basic forces                which shaped Andean prehistory are evident in the world today.                  Many countries such as the Soviet Union and Ethiopia consist of                 diverse ethnic groups brought together under a strong central                   rule.  An archaeological case such as the Lupaqa permits one to                 examine the interplay of central and regional forces over a long                period of time.",
