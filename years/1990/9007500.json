 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robbins will attempt to use a novel technique to ablate                     single protein species from living tissue.  This method will                    allow the molecular analysis of cell-cell interactions during                   development.  The technique is based on the observation that the                dye malachite green, when irraditated with a laser beam, destroys               proteins within a very small radius of the dye molecule (on the                 order of the diameter of one protein molecule).  Dr. Robbins will               conjugate malachite green to ligands for the acetylcholine                      receptor, incubate exposed, living neuromuscular junctions to the               conjugated dye, and irradiate small areas of the tissue with a                  laser.  He will then use morphological techniques on the light                  and electron microscopic levels to determine whether                            acetylcholine receptors were specifically destroyed, leaving the                neighboring molecules intact.  A further aim of the study is to                 determine whether nerve terminals can be selectively destroyed                  using this technique in combination with ligands that bind                      selectively to nerve terminal surfaces.  Destruction of nerve                   terminals and preservation of surrounding components of the                     neuromuscular junction will be assayed using electrophysiological               and morphological techniques.",
