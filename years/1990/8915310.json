 "awd_abstract_narration": "In flowering plants reproductive success is measured not                   only by the number of seeds produced in an individual's own                     fruits, but also by the number of seeds sired in fruits of other                plants.  This second component of reproduction has been coined, \"               male reproductive success,\" because it reflects a plant's ability               to disperse pollen or male gametes to other receptive individuals               in the population.  Few studies have measured male reproductive                 success in natural plant populations.  Consequently, we know very               little about the characteristics that make certain individuals                  more successful male parents than others.  This issue is central                to our understanding of the evolution of floral traits and                      functional sex ratios in plant populations.  The proposed                       research will use protein markers (isoenzymes) to monitor                       paternity in experimental populations of the alpine plant,                      Polemonium viscosum.  In this way it can be determined whether                  male reproductive success is influenced by extensive variation in               flower size, pollen production and nectar production in this                    species.                                                                             The proposed research has important implications for crop                  improvement and management.  First, our ability to prevent                      contamination of crop seed by pollen of related weed populations                depends on our knowledge of factors controlling pollen donation.                Next, spread of valuable genetic improvements through crop                      populations can be accomplished most readily if genes for such                  improvements are associated with others enhancing paternal                      success.  Third, introducing superior pollen donors into stands                 of orchard or seed crops should improve yield with little                       economic cost and no environmental damage.  The proposed research               will provide information basic to reaching these goals.",
