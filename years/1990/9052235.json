 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve a Simulation,                  Instrumentation, and Control Laboratory and the associated                      curriculum.  The College of Engineering employs this facility and               curriculum for instructing mechanical, chemical, aerospace, and                 electrical engineers as well as students minoring in biomedical                 and ocean engineering.  It is used annually by over 900 students                for core courses, senior electives, and senior projects                         including those which are sponsored by local industries.                                                                                                             A modern distributed control system and computers for                      simulation have been purchased to add to the existing controllers               and sensors in the present laboratory.  The instruments will be                 used by students to simulate, configure, and study multiple loop                and cascaded systems that have been beyond the capabilities of                  this facility in the past.  Computers and recorders are used to                 analyze experimental results and display them graphically.  This                new laboratory equipment improves students comprehension and                    reduces learning time.  It also reduces the time students spend                 on repetitive tasks such as manual data acquisition so that more                advanced topics and supplemental material can be covered in the                 same course.                                                                                                                                                         The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                     principal investigator's institution.",
