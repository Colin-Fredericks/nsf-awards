 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program deals with the synthesis and study of                         compounds which are designed to model the active site of blue                   copper proteins. These important proteins have a variety of                     functions, including participation in electron-transfer chains                  and the transport and activation of molecular oxygen.                                                                                                           The target protein sites are the reduced and oxidized sites of                  the blue proteins which participate in electron transfer chains                 and the sequentially oxidized binuclear units in hemocyanins                    and tyrosinases which respectively bind dioxygen for transport                  and activate dioxygen to accomplish the ring hydroxylation of                   aromatic substrates. Previous work on ligand design in this                     project has afforded redox-stable Cu(II) aliphatic thiolates                    and Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes having pseudotetrahedral                         coordination by biologically realistic ligands, such as                         imidazoles, thiolates and thioethers. The technology for                        synthesizing and elaborating polyimidazole ligands will be                      further developed with the aim of preparing good synthetic                      approximations of these target sites. The relationship of                       electronic structure to molecular structure will be probed by a                 combination of crystallographic, electronic spectral,                           electrochemical, epr, molecular orbital, and photoelectron                      spectroscopic and single crystal spin-echo studies. General                     questions regarding the epr properties of approximately                         tetrahedral Cu(II) and the nature of azide-to-Cu(II) LMCT will                  be probed by oriented single crystal spectroscopic studies of                   Cu(II) doped into isostructural Zn(II) lattices.",
