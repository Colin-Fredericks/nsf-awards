 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue an                       oceanographic instrumentation development project to develop,                   construct, and test a multi-channel, in situ flow injection                     chemical analysis system.  The objective of the device is to                    make autonomous in-situ colorometric measurements of nitrate                    and phosphate to full ocean depths for periods of up to six                     months.  Simultaneous measurement of additional inorganic                       nutrients is planned for he future.  A shallow water                            prototype has been constructed, but is depth limited because                    it relies on an umbilical cable to provide power and to                         control the various pumps and motors.                                                                                                                           This new effort will develop the electronics and mechanisms                     to enable the analyzer to function autonomously in depths of                    down to 6,000 meters.  Anti-fouling measures will be                            developed and reagent stability tests will be made to allow                     long-term unattended deployments.  The analyzer is ideally                      suited for testing a new scientific hypothesis about primary                    productivity in oligotrophic waters being driven by sporadic                    and short-lived injections of nutrients.  The analyzer is                       also intended to have numerous applications in time-series                      investigations relating to GOFS Global Geoscience initiative.",
