 "awd_abstract_narration": "A critical factor in the commercial success of new products                is the speed of their development, a factor that in turn hinges                 on the management of the early-stage product definition phase,                  research will devote particular attention to this phase of                      product development.  The research will examine the sources of                  market and technological data employed in this phase, as well as                the success with which product definition (which typically                      concludes with the development of functional specifications for a               new product) is integrated with the design of a new product.  The               management of product definition and its integration with design,               as well as the extent and nature of the databases and design                    tools used in the process, will then be related to product                      performance (measured in terms of return on investment, market                  share, break-even time, and other indexes).                                          Following the collection of product histories and detailed                 characterization of the product definition phases for each                      product, research will develop a generic framework for the                      conceptualization and analysis of product definition in different               technological and market environments.  This undertaking, as well               the analysis of the links between the management of product                     definition and design and product performance, will occupy the                  final stage of the project.",
