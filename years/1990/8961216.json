 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen is an ideal future fuel.  In an era of                                 declining cheap fossil fuels, water is an almost                                inexhaustible source of hydrogen and oxygen.  Utilization                       of solar  energy in the biocatalytic approach to water                          splitting is  attractive economically, since the light                          harvesting  mechanism and the active redox centers for                          water splitting exist in higher plants and algae.                               However, systems for the bioproduction of hydrogen are                          impractical, for at  least one of the following reasons:                        (a) the photosystems  of isolated plant (thylakoid)                             membranes become inactive  after a short period; (b)                            hydrogen production is often dependent upon highly                              oxygen-sensitive enzymes (e.g., hydrogenases), and (c)                          some photobiological hydrogen-producing systems depend                          upon electron transfer relays, such as methyl viologen,                         that are auto-oxidizable and light-sensitive.  The goal of                                                                                                      the proposed research work is to utilize a single                               technique to overcome these basic problems that restrict                        the use of biological systems as photocatalytic systems                         for the production of hydrogen and oxygen from water.  In                       this proposal, they have described the principal for, and                       the basic steps required to, test the feasibility of                            depositing low amounts of metallic Pt directly onto the                         photosynthetic membranes of intact cells of blue-green                          algae as a means of achieving a low-cost photocatalytic                         material with long term stability.",
