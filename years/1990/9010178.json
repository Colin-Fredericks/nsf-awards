 "awd_abstract_narration": "By the year 1860, the criminal justice system transformed from a                court-centered system of public adjudication, dependent upon jury               trials, to a police-centered system of private adjudication,                    dependent upon guilty pleas.  By 1914, the first public and                     private defender agencies were established and the public relied                more and more on guilty pleas and non-trial dispositions.  The                  dominant theoretical perspective of most longitudinal research                  that, as trials became more complex and as the number of criminal               cases increased, guilty pleas began to dominate as a means of                   facilitating the rapid disposition of the criminally accused.                   More recent research suggests that plea capitulation and the                    abandonment of jury trials have a much longer history than                      generally understood and that these changes relate to structural                factors at the very core of the criminal justice process.                                                                                                       This project will analyze the sociolegal context surrounding the                abandonment of jury trials.  The research will trace the                        historical underpinnings of the guilty plea system focusing on                  the structural factors which gave birth to the system more than                 fifty years prior to the establishment of institutional defense                 and the advent of modern case pressure.  Through a detailed                     analysis of New York City's prosecution files between 1800 and                  1900, previously unstudied trial transcripts, the Minute Book of                the Court of General Sessions, and biographies of lawyers who                   appeared in criminal cases, the study will provide the first                    systematic account of the construction of criminal cases in the                 nineteenth century with a focus on the method of disposition.                   The analysis will explain how the ascendancy of the police in the               evidence-gathering function and an increase in adversariness                    among lawyers combined to eliminate jury trials and to replace                  them with guilty pleas.                                                                                                                                         The results of this research will increase understanding of the                 reasons for change in the disposition of criminal cases from one                legal form to another.  The analysis will consider whether the                  shift in legal form occurred because of internalized responses to               the growth of business in courts or as a result of externally-                  generated pressures during a period in which there was profound                 change in the structure of society and the role of the state.                   Through such an historical analysis, important insights will be                 gleaned, both theoretically and practically, for understanding                  the present criminal justice system.",
