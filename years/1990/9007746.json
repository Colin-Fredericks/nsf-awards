 "awd_abstract_narration": "The authors have previously developed a model of hypertext,                     called Trellis, based on the formalism of Petri nets.  As in                    other hypertext models, Trellis represents information fragments and            the relationships that tie the fragments together.  An important                premise underlying Trellis is the claim that the actions of browsing            a hypertext should be formally represented.  A formal description               of browsing not only permits analysis and verification of the                   dynamic properties of a document, but also standardizes the                     semantics of browsing by providing a succinct, unambiguous, and                 implementation-independent definition of behavior.  Within its                  notational framework, Trellis provides the ability to synchronize               simultaneous traversals of separate paths through the hypertext and             the ability to incorporate access considerations into the hypertext,            specifyingnodes that can be proven to be visible only to certain                classes of browsers.  Trellis is a timed model, permitting                      specification of event delays and durations as well as                          system-generated invocations.                                                                                                                                   The investigators conduct two main projects under this research.                Both are based on the Trellis hypertext work already accomplished.              The first is the development of abstract representation methods that            permit the mapping of a single unified hypertext specification into             documents suitable for each of many different hypertext systems.                This, in turn, can reesult in interchange methods for different                 hypertext systems based on translation into and out of the unified              model.  The second is an authoring language \"laboratory\" to allow               the rapid specification and evaluation of hypertext authoring                   languages.  The projects will produce results of both theoretical               and practical interest.",
