 "awd_abstract_narration": "Near shore and continental shelf areas are significantly more                   supersaturated with CH4 than are the open oceans, yet global                    CH4 budgets ignore this fact because of the paucity of data.                    Investigations of the near shore regions of Washington and                      Oregon, particularly those areas influenced by the Columbia                     River plume and evaluations of the impact of this plume on the                  rate of CH4 evasion to the atmosphere will help to construct                    accurate CH4 budgets.                                                                                                                                           The lower Columbia River is, on average, supersaturaterd with                   methane by a factor of 120.  There is also an active population                 of methane oxidizing bacteria within the river with an average                  consumption rate of 20 nM methane per day.  Preliminary                         evidence indicates that within the estuary, as the salinity                     increases above about 5 parts per thousand, this microbial                      activity ceases.  This study will determine whether a marine                    population of methane oxidizing organisms becomes established                   as the Columbia River plume moves downstream and consumes the                   residual methane or if the riverine supply of methane is                        completely evaded to the atmosphere.  Ths study is relevant to                  all river systems and is of significance to current attempts to                 develop a methane budget for the oceans.",
