 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first and primary goal of the Department of Mathematics and            Computer Science at Spelman College is the production of quality female         scientists and engineers.  Hence, all of their efforts must advance this        goal.                                                                                In order to accomplish this goal they must build a strong research         component for their academic programs in computer science and applied           mathematics.  Although Spelman is primarily a teaching institution, they        recognize the close tie between teaching and research, and the benefits         of research at undergraduate institutions for faculty and for students.         They propose to increase the percentage of their student involved in            research or realistic practical experiences to at least seventy percent         of the upper division students (i.e., juniors and seniors) over the             next five years.  This requires that they develop a faculty of adequate         size for the student population with strong research and teaching               capabilities.                                                                        They propose to improve faculty teaching and research capability by        providing assistance to faculty in completing the doctorate degree in           Computer Science.  Two faculty members are in process toward the Ph.D           degree and will be given released time and/or financial assistance for          full-time study.  An additional faculty member will be recruited.               Cooperative arrangements will be made with other institutions who are           engaged in related research in order to increase the collaboration of           faculty in research.                                                                 Second, they will develop a computer science program which meets           the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) guidelines for                     accreditation.  The target date for accreditation is the academic year          1994-95.                                                                             Third, they will increase the percentage of students in computer           science with an interest in scientific applications through systematic          exposure of these students to scientific careers and involvement in             appropriate science related activities.  The new electives will provide         exposure to some of the more \"glamourous\" and exciting aspects of               computer science, e.g., robotics, computer vision, and computer                 graphics.  Cooperative arrangements with graduate institutions will be          established which will involve students in research and dual degree             programs and will include B.S/M.S programs in computer science.                 Cooperative arrangements with industry and government laboratories will         provide on-the job exposure to scientific careers through co-op and             summer internship programs.                                                          Fourth, they intend to separate the mathematics and computer               science programs by creating a new Department of Computer Science to            house the newly accredited program.  This transition will occur when the        number of full-time computer science faculty holding the doctorate              degree has reached a minimum of three.  This separation will produce a          faculty whose sole or primary interest is the improvement of research           and instruction in computer science.",
