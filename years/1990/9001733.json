 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop a novel, efficient              technique of noncontacting laser phased array generation of                     ultrasound, for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of solids and               processes.  The new technique uses an array of laser beams in place             of a single beam.  The research will include a basic study to                   evaluate the performance of and develop an analytical model for                 the phased array.  Specific applications to noncontact NDE on-line              control of the depth of penetration and porosity during a gas metal             arc welding (GMAW) process will be pursued.  An electromagnetic                 acoustic transducer will be used as a noncontact receiver.  The                 research has five phases as follows: (1) development of an                      analytical model for predicting the generation of ultrasound by a               laser phased array; (2) experimental verification of the model for              the phased array;  (3) application of phased array to noncontact                NDE on-line control of the depth of weld pool penetration and                   porosity; (4) development of an analytical model for propagation                of sound through the weld pool; and (5) development of the data                 acquisition system and algorithms.  The information on weld pool                penetration and porosity extracted from the ultrasonic signal will              be used in the system feedback for the welding power-supply,                    current, or speed control, to achieve the desired penetration and               porosity.",
