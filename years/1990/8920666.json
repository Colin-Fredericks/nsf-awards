 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the United States becomes a racially more heterogeneous society,             the perspectives and experiences of different ethnic groups need                to be identified and understood if U.S. ideals of participation and             accountability, and social justice and equality are to be                       maintained.  Ethics and Values Studies supports research and                    educational projects on ethical and value aspects of the                        interaction between science, technology and society.  Projects                  examine the social values and mutual obligations and                            responsibilities that arise in these interactions.  The first phase             of this project, to be undertaken by the American Association for               the Advancement of Science with the cooperation of several                      cosponsoring organizations, consists of a workshop that will                    introduce minority scholars to research, education and resources                in ethics and values studies.  Tentatively, the workshop is                     expected to occur over eight days in the summer of 1991, in or                  nearby Washington, DC.  There will be a national recruitment effort             for both faculty and participants.  An advisory board, including                minority representatives and EVS scholars, will assist project                  staff throughout the development and assessment of the effort.  The             workshop will identify research opportunities and acquire more                  knowledge on the content of minority perspectives on ethical and                value aspects of science, technology and society interactions.  It              will provide participants with the opportunity to define a research             and educational agenda for themselves and other EVS scholars, and               establish a network of individuals and resources.  Phase two of the             project will provide further support for workshop participants to               undertake followup research and related activities.  In this way,               the project can make a contribution to defining and understanding               ethical and value aspects of the interactions of science and                    technology with our pluralistic, heterogeneous culture.                                                                                                         The investigators, advisory board, and tentative faculty for this               project are highly qualified; numerous professional societies and               minority organizations have agreed to sponsor it and help recruit               appropriate participants; the issues are very important; results                will be appropriately disseminated.  The project is meritorious and             recommended for award.",
