 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate the potential for development of                 new cutting/lubricating fluid slurries that would have                          significantly higher thermal capacities than those currently                    available and would have potential application to high-speed                    machining.  Fluid slurries will be designed, fabricated, and                    tested in both the laboratory and the machine shop to demonstrate               the conceptual feasibility for provision of superior cooling and                lubricating performance for machining operations at atmospheric                 pressure.  The derivation of new cooling and lubricating fluids                 with significantly improved thermal properties could increase                   cutting tool life, improve product quality and uniformity, reduce               time for tool changing, increase production, reduce thermal                     distortion of products, facilitate precision engineering, and                   reduce both fluid loss and operator exposure to potentially                     hazardous fumes associated with vaporizing current fluids during                high-speed machining operations.",
