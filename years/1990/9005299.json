 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been shown previously that the functional state of                       UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (GT) is determined in part by the                   lipid environment.  Evidence obtained in the last grant                         period suggests that GT is an oligomer regulated by protein-                    protein interactions, which are modulated in turn by the                        lipids at the annulus.  Moreover, it appears that the                           organization of protein-protein interactions as well as the                     distribution of lipids in untreated microsomes, which                           constrain the maximal activity of GT, is not the                                thermodynamically most stable state of microsomes.  This                        metastable organization and associated constraint on the                        activity of microsomal enzymes seem to be general properties                    of microsomal enzymes in that two other enzymes studied                         behave like GT.  This study establishes the validity of the                     above ideas via detailed studies of GT, glucose-6-Pase, and                     acylCoA ligase in microsomes and in pure, reconstituted                         systems.  If current studies establish that pure GT is an                       oligomer the conditions under which it dissociates will be                      determined to establish the factors that account for                            constaint and organization in intact microsomes.  Independent                   of these results ongoing studies are being conducted on the                     influence of the lipid environment on the functional state                      and stability of GT.                                                                                                                                            This research is fundamental to our understanding of the                        organization and function of membrane proteins as well as the                   role of lipids in modulating the behavior of these proteins.                    Progress in this area will have an impact on basic cellular                     biology, biochemistry and pathobiology.***//",
