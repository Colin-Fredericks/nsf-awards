 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported under the Presidential Young                          Investigator (PYI) Award program.  The project is initiated                     in FY 90 for a 5-year period.                                                                                                                                   The objectives of the project is to develop analytical                          modeling techniques for vibrating systems and apply them in                     earthquake engineering.  The development of analytical models                   that accurately represent structural behavior plays a crucial                   role in dynamic response prediction.  Many analytical                           procedures are rendered ineffective if the finite element                       model and computational technique used in implementing the                      procedure involve inaccuracies due to improper respresentation                  of the vibrating system.  The research will focus on the                        development of finite element models used to implement dynamic                  analyses of structural systems.  These models must accurately                   represent all structural attributes such as stiffness and mass                  properties, boundary conditions, joint fixities, and material                   and geometric nonlinearities.                                                                                                                                   Several tasks have been identified as part of an overall                        research program:  1) development of a high-resolution finite                   element model of an existing structure which will represent                     structural characteristics with minimal approximation, 2)                       development of a conventional finite element model of the same                  structe which contains typical modeling assumptions, 3)                         studies involving the two models which evaluate the validity                    of the assumptions in the conventional model when compared to                   the high-resolution model, and 4) development of new                            techniques which will minimize the inaccuracies associated                      with the modeling associated with the modeling assumptions.                     This research will be implemented on structures undergoing                      seismic excitation.                                                                                                                                             This research will benefit industry by verifying and                            quantifying assumptions used in modeling vibrating systems and                  will enhance dynamic analysis technology by developing                          techniques which minimize modeling inaccuracies.",
