 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will develop efficient procedures for estimating                  critical quantities in counting and enumeration problems with                   applications to manufacturing problems that arise as components                 of decision making models in management, production and                         distribution systems.  The researchers plan relies on a sampling                procedure that derives its advantage by using a Markov chain                    structure to generate successive samples of the combinatorial                   objects needed in considerably less computing time than it takes                to generate them as independently and identically distributed                   (i.i.d.) random combinatorial objects.  In particular, this                     generating efficiency appears to increase as the size of the                    problem increases.  Although the generating method also appears                 to inflate the variance of the overall estimate, preliminary                    analysis indicates that this inflation is more than offset by the               increasingly more efficient generating time, resulting in a                     highly efficient method of estimating the critical quantities of                interest.                                                                            This method will be develop in the context of counting and                 enumeration problems especially as encountered in network                       reliability and feasible flow setups as they apply to                           manufacturing problems.  Research will also be conducted into                   finding optimal Markovian dependence structures that maximize                   efficiency, into incorporating a priori bounds into this                        methodology and into the extension of this technique to other                   areas such as simulated annealing.",
