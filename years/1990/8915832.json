 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent GLORIA surveys and dredging have discovered a large                      field of young alkalic flood basalts across the flexural arch                   north of the Hawaiian island chain.  These rocks represent a                    significant and previously unknown part of Hawaiian volcanic                    history, and promise to advance greatly our understanding of                    hot-spot volcanism.  Drs. Mahoney and Sinton will oversee                       isotopic and trace element analyses on 20-30 dredge samples                     from this region in order to determine mantle sources and gain                  insight into the magmatic history of this largery of this large                 flow field.  Previous understanding of hotspot, mid-plate                       volcanic (like those of the Hawaiian islands) have identified                   three phases: 1) the major shield building episode of tholeitic                 composition; 2) a minor (<1% by volume) alkalic cap; and 3) a                   small outpouring of silica-poor, \" rejuvenated\" lavas after a                   few million years of quiesence.  Initial studies by Clague                      (USGS, a not-cost collaborator on this request) show the arch                   volcanics are closest in character to this last, \"rejuvenated\"                  suite of MORB-like rocks.  Mahoney and Sinton hope to gain                      better understanding of the nature and variability of probable                  mantle sources, and the respective roles of partial melting,                    magma mixing and fractional crystallization.",
