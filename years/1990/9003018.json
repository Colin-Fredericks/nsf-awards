 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quasicrystalline materials are intriguing because of their fivefold           symmetry which is incompatible with periodic translational order.  Two          models of quasicrystal structure were originally proposed: the                  quasiperiodic crystal or \"Penrose tiling\" model and the icosahedral             glass model.  Dr. Strandburg's research, along with that of a number            of others, suggested a third possibility - the entropically stabilized          or \"random tiling\" model.  In this project she will use computer                simulation techniques to study:  (1) properties of the random tiling            model in three dimensions.  Results will allow comparisons with                 experiment, to distinguish between the suggested structural models;             and (2) crystal growth and interface roughness of the random tiling             model.  Nanocrystals are compactions of nanometer-sized crystallites.           They have novel properties due to their large density of grain                  boundaries.  The anomalous stability of these materials against grain           growth will be investigated using a simple topological model.                     Interactive activities include a mentorship program pairing female            students with women scientists at Argonne and Fermilab; regular                 gatherings of female physics students for discussion of issues of               interest to women in science; Ph.D. thesis research supervision; and            teaching introductory undergraduate physics and graduate solid state            physics.                                                                          This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
