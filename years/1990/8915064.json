 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaboration in oceanography between Dr. Kozo              Takahashi, Department of Geology and Geophysics, Woods Hole                     Oceanographic Institution, and Dr. Yoshiaki Maita, Hokkaido                     University, Japan.  These scientists, and colleagues working with               them, are carrying out oceanographic and ecological studies in the              central subarctic Pacific Ocean, including the Bering Sea.  This                region is one of high biological productivity, and the researchers              are measuring seasonal fluxes there of biogenically produced                    particles that variously contain silica, calcium carbonate, and/or              organic carbon compounds.  The data will be used to assess surface              biological productivity and water column ecosystems of the region.              Cooperation with the Japanese scientists allows Dr. Takahashi and               his colleagues to participate in Japanese cruises to this area for              the purpose of deploying and recovering the sediment traps needed               for data collection.  Water samples and hydrographic data at the                research sites are also taken.  Physical classification and chemical            analyses of the collected samples will be carried out.  Historical              data sets obtained from this region by Japanese scientists over the             past several decades are also available to the U.S. researchers.                                                                                                Funds from this award will support the travel of U.S. scientists in             this project to Japan in order to meet with their Japanese colleagues           to discuss and exchange data, as well as plan future field work                 cooperation.  A second meeting a year or so later, after additional             field studies, will be held in the U.S. for this purpose.",
