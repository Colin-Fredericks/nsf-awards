 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will contribute to the theory of insect-plant                interactions by examining patterns of insect attack in host plant               hybrid zones.  Communities of gall-forming wasps and leaf-mining                moths will be examined in 15 oak hybrid zones in Mexico and the                 Southwestern United States.  Densities of insects on hybrid trees               will be compared to those on non-hybrid trees.  The research will               elucidate factors that influence insect attack in plant hybrid                  zones.  Factors to be examined include:  geographic structure of                hybrid zones, taxonomic relationships between parental oak                      species, and morphological relationships between parental oak                   species.  Mechanistic hypotheses will be formulated that explain                differences in insect attack between hybrid and non-hybrid                      plants.  Important insights will be gained into how insect faunas               accrue on host plants.  These ideas will contribute to                          understanding whether hybrid zones act as a sink for herbivores,                an important issue in plant-herbivore interaction theory.  From                 an applied perspective, results of the research will bear                       directly on key questions regarding the response of herbivorous                 insects to genetically altered crop plants and hybrid zones which               may be near agricultural areas.",
