 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research allows two anthropologists at the University of New               Mexico to test alternative models of male parenting in the                      contemporary U.S.  This study will test a specific evolutionary                 model of the determinants of male fertility and parenting                       practices, designed to explain the number of children men have,                 the economic and noneconomic resources men invest in their                      children, commonality and conflict of interest between men and                  women in fertility, parenting and mating decisions, and                         differential investment in offspring within sibships.  The                      predictions of alternative economic and evolutionary models will                also be tested.                                                                                                                                                 Data will be obtained through structured interviews with a                      representative sample of 750 Anglo and Hispanic men over 50 years               of age in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  A short interview will                      determine eligibility for the study, and a long interview will                  obtain fertility, parenting and income data on three generations                of individuals.  This research is important because increased                   understanding of fertility and parenting in general will help us                understand the causes of the deomgraphic transition, and                        increased understanding of fertility in different ethnic groups                 in the US can help planners design policies to satisfy the needs                of different populations.",
