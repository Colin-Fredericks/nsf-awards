 "awd_abstract_narration": "The F1 ATPase is large, membrane-associated protein which                       links an equilibrium reaction between the two adenine                           nucleotides, adenosine triphosphate and adenosine                               diphosphate, and the translocation of protons across the                        membrane.  Thus, with a suitable proton electrochemical                         potential difference across the membrane it can drive the net                   synthesis of adenosine triphosphate.  This system will be                       studied by phosphorous solid state nuclear magnetic                             resonance.  Attempts will be made to detect intermediates in                    the reaction and to measure rates of reaction.  Attempts will                   also be made to determine distances between a bound metal ion                   required for reactions (manganese will be substituted for                       magnesium) and the phosphate groups of the nucleotide.                                                                                                          The overall goal of this work is to define the structure and                    kinetics of the active site of the enzyme in situ; previous                     studies have relied on extraction techniques which may not                      reflect the true concentrations of reactants on the enzyme                      itself.  Longer term aims of this study are to extend the NMR                   experiments and measure the proximity of specific amino acid                    residues on the protein to the bound adenine nucleotides.",
