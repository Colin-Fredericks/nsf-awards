 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant continues the seminar program of the Conference on                   Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME).  The purpose of                 this conference series is to stimulate discussion and research on               the frontiers of econometric and mathematical economic theory and               methodology.  CEME also encourages the application of advanced                  mathematical, statistical, and numerical analysis techniques in                 empirical economic studies.  The conference shortens the time                   lags between the conception of ideas and their dissemination by                 inducing leading scholars to cooperatively apply their talents to               selected, unresolved issues which they feel are currently                       receiving inadequate attention.                                                                                                                                 This conference series continues to make significant                            contributions to economic theory and econometrics.  Since its                   inception in 1970, seminar groups have produced more than 700                   working papers and have published many books and numerous                       articles in professional journals.  A total of 190 meetings have                been held involving more than 800 scholars.  Currently there are                active seminars on general equilibrium models, comparisons of                   econometric models, applied general equilibrium workshops,                      time series analysis, Bayesian inference in econometrics,                       decentralized economic planning, and stochastic analysis.  In                   addition CEME publishes a \"Call for Conference Proposals\"                       annually as a mechanism for co-funding small conferences in the                 area of econometrics.  A new seminar group in financial market                  theory and analysis will begin meeting in early 1990.",
