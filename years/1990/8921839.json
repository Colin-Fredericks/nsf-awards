 "awd_abstract_narration": "From a genetic perspective, conservation biology requires               the preservation of genetic diversity or variability.  Over long                periods of time, mutation provides the genetic variation upon                   which natural selection may act.  However, in populations                       constrained in size over several generations, much of the genetic               variation may be lost.  Once lost, a very long time is required                 for mutation to reestablish pre.existing levels of genetic                      diversity.  Moreover, many species are now subject to extreme and               unnatural selection.  It is therefore of practical importance to                study the maintenance of genetic variation in small populations.                Questions of gene survival in small populations have been well                  studied in recent years, and new statistical methodology has                    found application in the assessment of the genetic potential of                 small populations of endangered species, such as the Andean                     condor and Przewalski's horse.  This statistical research will be               extended in three projects by Dr. Elizabeth Thompson and her                    colleagues at the University of Washington.                                             There are three aspects of the analysis of the pedigree                 structure of a small population, all of which are directly                      relevant to the genetic management, and thence to the                           conservation biology of species.  From the central trio of                      pedigree, genetic model, and observational data, one can consider               inferences of pedigree structure, inferences of the genetic basis               of an observed trait, or computation of probabilities of gene                   survival or of specific phenotypic events.  The currently                       proposed focus is the extension of previous methods and                         development of new approaches to these three areas, in the                      context of complex genetic data such as DNA.fingerprint data.  An               understanding of the genetic and genealogical structure of                      populations is fundamental to conservation, where endangered                    species exist in limited numbers or fragmented isolates.  A study               of the genetics alone cannot provide specific solutions.                        However, all species have genes, all populations have pedigrees,                and all genetic isolates have a structure that will affect their                maintenance and long.term survival.",
