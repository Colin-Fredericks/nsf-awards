 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate cooperation between Professor Donald M.              Marcus, Baylor College of Medicine, and Dr. Akemi Suzuki, The                   Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan, and                     colleagues in both countries working with them.  They will                      collaborate in a study of the molecular basis of the interaction                between certain carbohydrate antigens and the specific antibodies               that \"recognize\" them.  The work is of biomedical significance                  because of the protection such antibodies provide against                       microorganisms, and because of their role in blood transfusion and              organ transplantation.  The researchers will carry out experiments              aimed at learning the sequence of amino acids and the molecular                 geometry in that portion of the antibody responsible for binding                to the carbohydrate.  Using the technique of site-directed                      mutagenesis, they will alter selectively the amino acid sequences               in the antibody molecule, and observe the resulting effect on the               binding.  They will also employ nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)                studies and computer modeling in this effort to better understand               the structure of the antibody combining site.                                                                                                                   Professor Marcus is an immunologist, with expertise in determining              the structure of immunoglobulin genes.  His Japanese colleagues                 are biophysicists with considerable experience in the use of nmr                in determining the three-dimensional structures of carbohydrates                and proteins.  The complementary strengths of the two groups will               permit a multidisciplinary approach that should enhance an                      understanding of the mechanism of the antibody-carbohydrate                     interaction and, more generally, provide additional information on              the characteristic specificity of antigen-antibody reactions.",
