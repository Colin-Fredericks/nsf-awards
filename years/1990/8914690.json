 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator (PI) will develop techniques for                the modeling, analysis, design, and optimization of distributed                 network management and control schemes for broadband                            communications networks.  The emphasis will be on interconnected                broadband local and metropolitan area telecommunications                        networks.  Network management architectures for such network                    structures are hierarchically arranged to yield lower complexity                and more reliable implementations.  They highly capitalize on                   parallel control, processing, and computational processes to                    yield considerable speed up of the management and control                       process.  These measures ensure that control actions are executed               in a timely manner, reacting fast to observed changes in                        distributed loading, capacity, performance, and system                          conditions.  This research will focus on key elements involved in               the design of such distributed management and control systems                   including the following issues:   1. Information sensing,                       observation, and gathering procedures for collecting relevant                   information for underlying network management tasks.  2.                        hierarchial network management architectures and control                        policies.  3. development of numerically effective techniques for               studying the steady state performance of such distributed network               management policies.",
