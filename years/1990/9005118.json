 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will be conducted in several areas of                        probability and ergodic theory: 1) Construction and                             fundamental properties of Gibbs states on sequence                              spaces with countable alphabets; 2) applications to                             dynamical systems with countable symbolic dynamics,                             e.g., geodesic flows on noncompact manifolds and                                conformal dynamical systems with parabolic points; 3)                           related problems concerning statistical regularities of                         orbits in flows; and 4) temporal and spatial growth in                          branching diffusion processes and branching random                              walks.                                                                               This research is a blend of statistical theory,                            dynamical systems, and ergodic theory.  There is a broad                        class of dynamical systems for which the well-developed                         machinery of symbolic dynamics is available.  This class                        is characterized by the fact that the associated                                symbolic dynamics needs only a finite alphabet (so one                          has to deal with finite state Markov processes).  This                          research extends this class to those systems for which                          an infinitely countable alphabet becomes necessary and                          develops the corresponding machinery.  This will provide                        the tools for obtaining new results about the clustering                        of orbits at limit sets and about the statistics of                             closed geodesics on Riemannian manifolds.  The outcome                          of this work will be to unite many known results which                          were won by very different methods, so unifying, thus                           simplifying, areas with quite separate results.",
