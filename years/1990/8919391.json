 "awd_abstract_narration": "This impressive, ambitious, complex proposal will investigate                   some of the most important features of the family's impact on the               development of competence in children.  More specifically, the                  work will examine the impact of parent-child interactions on peer               relationships, the effects of parental supervision on children's                peer interactions, and the role of the parent as provided of                    opportunities for peer interaction.  A short term longitudinal                  study will be conducted over a 4 year period to study these                     issues, when children are in grades K-3. Observational and                      interview measures of family function will be taken yearly as                   will measures of familial management of peer relationships.  The                research promises to tell us much about the effects of different                parenting styles and family climate on the development of social                competence.  This proposal promises to address issues of                        important theoretical and practical concern, and to provide                     crucial information of the manner in which families produce                     children who are capable, or less capable, of forming social                    relationships that work for their own good, and the good of                     others in the society.",
