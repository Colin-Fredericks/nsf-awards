 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brazil is currently completing a long transition away from military             rule toward a fully democratic system.  For democratic rule to last,            the legislature must contribute to the solution of the country's                critical social and economic problems.  There is increasing concern,            however, that the congress is weakened due to a number of factors:              the absence of strong party identification on the part of the                   electorate; the inability of deputies to coalesce along party lines             on national issues; the failure of party leaders to maintain party              coalitions; and, the focus of deputies on pork-barrel legislation               and patronage.  This project attends to these issues by                         investigating congressional elections in Brazil between 1978 and                1990.                                                                                                                                                           The problems in Brazil are in part the result of the institutional              structure of Brazilian elections.  Brazil's electoral system is                 proportional, with each state constituting an individual multi-member           district.  Voters, however, cast ballots for individuals, not                   parties, and the order of votes received by individual candidates               determines winners.  This institutional structure, coupled with the             clientelistic nature of Brazilian society, encourages many deputies             to restrict their campaigning to discrete sub-state regions.  A group           of deputies may represent a single party, but their true orientation            is local or regional.  Deputies may care a great deal about bringing            jobs and projects to the residents of their bailiwicks, while                   legislation on national issues becomes unimportant to their                     reelection chances.                                                                                                                                             Until recently, the absence of election results below the state level           made serious analysis impossible, but recently released county-level            results enable scholars to begin to investigate the problem.  In                addition to undertaking a statistical analysis of the results of the            four elections between 1978 and 1990, the investigator will interview           congressmen, journalists and academics about campaign strategies and            tactics.  In addition, voting records and committee tactics will be             examined, as well as the behavior of deputies in the Congress.                                                                                                  The major objective of the project is to understand how                         traditionalist clientelistic forms of societal organization interact            over time with political institutions and how this interaction is               affected by migration, the expansion of communications media, and               improved transportation.  The researchers also investigate the                  strategies of congressional candidates faced with certain                       institutional and societal incentives and constraints.  Finally, the            project seeks to further understanding of the impact of political               institutions on the transition to democracy in Latin America as a               whole, especially in terms of the kinds of legislative behavior                 institutions encourage.",
