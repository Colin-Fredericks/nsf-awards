Teachers                       from North Carolina and Minnesota will be linked with                           scientists from Universities in those states and from                           agencies such as the U.S Department of Agriculture and the                      U.S. Forest Service in programs which include visits to                         research sites, performance of laboratory experiments, and                      summer institutes which include both instruction and the                        development of curriculum materials for use in the                              pre-college classroom.  The teachers participating in the                       first year of the project will serve as Master teachers in                      the later years to form the core of a network of teachers and                   scientists and to offer a series of workshops which will draw                   more teachers into the network.  Cost-sharing in the amount                     of $150,000 is 23% of the NSF contribution to the project.",
