 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in metallurgy                    between Dr. John Barnard, University of Alabama and Dr. Peter                   Goodhew, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering,                 University of Liverpoool, U.K.  The project will focus on                       microstructural characterization by Transmission Electron                       Microscopy (TEM) of iron-based binary alloy thin films as a                     function of processing conditions and thermal treatment.                                                                                                        Dr. Barnard has been involved to date in substantial work on                    the topic of thin film growth by sputtering and characteriza-                   tion by magnetometry.  In this project he will undertake in                     Liverpool microstructural and crystallographic characterization                 of two Fe-based thin film systems, Fe-N and Fe-Sn as a                          function of temperature.  Dr. Barnard will work directly                        with Dr. Goodhew and members of his group in order to master                    analytic TEM techniques, which can then be introduced to the                    University of Alabama's new TEM facility.  Dr. Goodhew has                      extensive expertise in analytical and high resolution                           electronmicroscopy.  In addition, Liverpool University has                      exceptional microscopy facilities.  The results of this                         research could provide insights into the nature of the short-                   range order in the amorphous state, as well as defining the                     structural kinetics of crystallization in this system.",
