 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Neurobiology and                 Behavior at Cornell University to help purchase equipment which                 will be used to teach undergraduate biology students, and students              in allied fields such as physics, engineering and computer                      sciences, modern techniques in cellular neuroscience through hands-             on laboratory experience.  This will be accomplished by active                  research scientists in a series of three undergraduate courses                  entitled:  1) Principles of Neurophysiology, 2) Electronics for                 Neurobiologists, and 3) Computer Interfacing for Neurobiologists.               In the first course, undergraduates will use the state-of-the-art               research equipment (computers, voltage clamp amplifiers,                        micromanipulators, microelectrode pullers, and perfusion pumps) in              laboratory exercises designed to teach the principles of electrical             signalling in the nervous system.  In these exercises, computer                 data acquisition and analysis and teaching students the use of                  Macintosh II computers, along with the related hardware and                     software necessary for this purpose will be emphasized.  This                   course will replace all standard vertebrate preparations with                   invertebrate model systems.  In the electronics course, students                will learn fundamental principles of electronics as applied to                  electrophysiology and other biological fields to design simple,                 relevant circuits such as those used for basic voltage and patch                clamp amplifiers.  The computer interfacing course will use the                 Macintosh II computers to teach the technical details (hardware and             software) of computer interfacing methods in biological                         experiments.  This project has important significance not only in               providing undergraduates with training in new and powerful methods              of experimental neuroscience, but also in developing advanced                   teaching tools useful for other neuroscience training programs.                 Through this project, undergraduate students will gain theoretical              and technical skills that will help them be productive scientists               in both corporate and academic research environments.  The grantee              is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
