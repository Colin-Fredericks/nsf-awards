The program will provide undergraduates               contemplating a career in the biological sciences with 1) an                    introduction to current research in the areas of soil ecology,                  plant and insect ecology, plant physiology, and behavioral ecology;             2) the opportunity to conduct original research in a supportive,                interactive environment; and 3) instruction in the planning,                    execution, and interpretation of research in the areas of ecology               and behavior.  All participating students will attend weekly                    meetings that will introduce them to the fields of ecology and                  behavior, aid in planning and executing an original research                    project, and provide advice on applying to graduate school.  They               will also present the results of their research in a short seminar              at the end of the summer.  Students will work with faculty members              on their projects, and will also be able to interact with other                 students and post-docs in their laboratories.",
