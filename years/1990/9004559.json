 "awd_abstract_narration": "PIs will investigate the tectonic setting, magmatic origin                and stratigraphic significance of altered volcanic ash beds (K-                 bentonites) in the Middle and Upper Ordovician strata of                        Baltoscandia and to compare these data with similar data from                   North America.  Preliminary studies strongly suggest these K-                   bentonite beds on both sides of lapetus had a common source and a               common tectonic setting.  If this indication proves correct, the                most widespread of these beds will have profound event-                         stratigraphic implications for the Ordovician, and our                          understanding of Laurentia and Baltica plate positions during the               Taconian orogeny will be substantially improved.  Similarly, the                abundance of Silurian K-bentonites throughout Baltoscandia and                  the UK indicates ongoing plate-margin volcanism from Llandovery                 through Ludlow time.  PIs will collect samples of the most                      extensive beds from cores and outcrops in Estonia, Sweden and                   Norway.  They will add to existing information on the                           biostratigraphic position of these beds and use chemical                        fingerprinting of both bulk samples and selected phenocrysts to                 make accurate correlations with North American beds.  These will                be compared with trans-Atlantic stratigraphic relations of K-                   bentonites suggested by traditional biostratigraphy and by                      graphic correlation using conodonts.  We will also obtain high-                 resolution Ar age spectra and U-Pb dates from biotite and zircon                separates from biostratigraphically well-constrained K-bentonites               that will add key ages to the Ordovician time scale.  Trace                     element data will be plotted on discrimination diagrams to                      interpret the tectonic and magmatic settings of these beds.",
