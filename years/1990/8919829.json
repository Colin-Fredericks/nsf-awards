 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study the function of the vertebrate                 eye.  Certain proteins in the retina of the eye undergo changes                 in concentration or conformation when subjected to different                    environmental conditions.  One group of proteins found in the                   outer segment of the photoreceptor cell are chemically altered                  after exposure to light.  Much less is known about the proteins                 contained in the terminal end of the photoreceptor cell.  This                  structure is important because the terminal makes contact with                  the nerve cells which connect to higher brain centers.  Within                  these terminal regions are \"ribbon-like\" structures containing a                unique protein (88kD), which may be necessary for photoreceptor                 cells to communicate with nerve cells.                                                                                                                          Immunological and ultrastructural techniques such as monoclonal                 antibodies and electron microscopy will be used to study the 88kD               protein in the photoreceptor terminal.  Once localized, the 88kD                protein will be purified and isolated.  The gene for this protein               will be cloned and the 88kD protein sequence will be compared to                other similar proteins in national databases.  These studies will               provide insight into the mechanisms of cellular communication                   between the eye and the brain.  It may also lead to advances in                 the study of retinal diseases.",
