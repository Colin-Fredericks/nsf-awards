 "awd_abstract_narration": "Secondary sexual traits are common in animals, and male                    traits are sometimes so strongly developed that they appear                     maladaptive.  What causes a particular combination of male traits               and female preferences in a given population, and why do                        populations evolve different combinations of traits?  The                       investigators are addressing this question in the guppy at                      several levels: the mechanisms of female choice, the effects of                 female choice on the evolution of color patterns within                         populations, and testing the prediction (from sexual selection                  theory) of co-divergence of female choice criteria and male                     traits among populations.                                                            This is a collaborative effort with John A. Endler,                        University of California @ Santa Barbara.  They propose to                      explicitly test two major predictions from sexual selection                     theory.  First, they will investigate the reciprocal evolution of               male traits and female choice.  Second, they propose to explore                 the effects of the sensory drive process, and how this interacts                with the evolution of male traits and female choice.  In order to               do this, they propose to carry out three long-term selection                    experiments which should lead to long term genetic changes in                   female preferences and male traits.  One experiment selects for                 male traits and looks for evolution of female preferences.                      Another selects for female preferences (via selection on spectral               sensitivity) and looks for evolution of male traits.  The third                 modifies the perception of color patterns (to females and                       predators) by varying ambient light color and predator color                    vision, and looks for changes in male traits and female                         preferences.                                                                         The proposed continuation of the investigators work will                   yield an unusually complete understanding of the processes which                affect the long term joint genetic change of female choice and                  secondary male traits under the influence of sexual selection and               predation.",
