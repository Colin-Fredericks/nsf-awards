 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, sponsored by the Woodrow Wilson Foundation, is                    an 18 month project starting March 1, 1990.  It is intended                     for 50 outstanding middle school and high school (grades 7-9)                   teachers who have the responsibility for teaching the first                     school physical science course.  Funds will support: (1) the                    national recruitment and selection of the participants, (2)                     an intensive four-week summer course held on the campus of                      Princeton University which will include content instruction                     and the development of teaching materials, (3) publication of                   the most useful examples of the instructional materials                         prepared during the summer program and (4) stipends for                         outreach activities by the participants during the next                         academic year.  A long-term goal of the project is to build a                   cadre of experienced, knowledgeable teachers who will become                    educational leaders and school resource agents.  The National                   Science Foundation is a participant in a larger project whose                   total budget is $3,029,590.  NSF dollars in the amount of                       $381,910 are therefore being matched approximately 8:1 with                     funds from other sources.",
