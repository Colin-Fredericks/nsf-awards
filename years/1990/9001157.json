 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization has long been important to plant breeding and                the production of crop plants.  Less well understood, however, is               the importance of hybridization in the evolution of wild plants.                In part this is because it can be difficult to detect and                       document the occurrence of hybridization events and to                          distinguish genetic novelties introduced from another species                   from natural genetic variation arising within a species by                      mutation processes.  Recently, new and powerful molecular                       methods for analyzing directly the DNA of plants have made                      possible a broad analysis of this problem.                                           Graduate student Hanson under the guidance of Dr. Loren                    Rieseberg of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden is studying a                  presumptive case of repeated hybridization events (termed                       introgression) between two species of yuccas of the American                    Southwest.  Protein markers are being assayed by electrophoresis,               and variation in nuclear ribosomal and plastid DNA is being                     analyzed by enzymatic restriction-sites.  Several related yucca                 species are also being studied to infer the phylogenetic                        relationships among species in this group, in order to determine                whether the two hybridizing species have shared a recent common                 ancestor.  Recent ancestry can also lead to a pattern of shared                 genetic markers that could be confused with hybridization.  The                 range of protein and DNA markers to be studied, from both nuclear               and chloroplast genomes, will help distinguish between recent                   common ancestry and current introgression.  The study will thus                 advance understanding of hybridization in natural plant                         populations, and will help in the training of a young plant                     scientist.",
