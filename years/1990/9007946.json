 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two main themes to be followed in this project.                  One concerns questions of regularity involving quasi-regular                    mappings.  These are mappings of the plane or higher dimensional                space in which distortion of small sets such as discs is                        controlled in a measurable way.  The maps are not required to be                univalent (quasi-conformal) and they are characterized as                       solutions of systems of elliptic partial differential equations                 (of degenerate type).  One of the primary concerns in the study                 of quasi-regular mappings is that of finding estimates on the                   growth of such mappings as well as characterizing extremal                      mappings subject to given boundary conditions.  In two                          dimensions, one is eventually led to the complex Hilbert                        transform.  Various regularity results depend on estimates of the               norm of this transform, specifically the p-th power norm.  Work                 will be done on sharpening estimates for the norm.                                   A second line of investigation will focus on variational                   energy integrals of classes of functions whose stationary points                are  quasi-conformal.  In particular, work will be done in                      estimating energy integrals over subsets of a given domain in                   terms of the  energy integral over the full domain, multiplied by               a power of the measure of the subset. The best value of the power               remains to be determined.  At this time, the only known results                 are in the  case where the domain is a solid disc or ball.",
