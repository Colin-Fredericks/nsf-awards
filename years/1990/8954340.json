 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two week summer workshop at Mississippi State University for                  Chemistry faculty members from undergraduate institutions in                    Mississippi and the adjoining states of Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama,           and Louisiana is being conducted.  A special effort is being made to            attract women and minority participants from within the region.  The            topic of computer-aided spectroscopy is being treated in three                  components involving Fourier transform infrared and Fourier transform           nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and computer-aided data               acquisition and analysis.  Those topics represent more modern methods           of chemical analysis which are likely to be less familiar to most               undergraduate faculty.  The workshop consists of both lecture and               laboratory components in which hands-on experience are helping                  emphasize the advanced concepts developed in the classroom.  The                primary goals of the workshop are to up-date the training of the                undergraduate faculty on modern methods of spectroscopic analysis,              encourage the enhancement of the current curricula at the participants'         home institutions, and promote continued interaction between workshop           staff and participants for future seminars, consulting, or research             collaboration.  A workshop handbook containing the materials and                experiments covered is being developed for each participant.   The              handbook is being used in conjunction with the workshop, and afterwards         the participating faculty are taking it to their home institutions to           aid in curriculum development.",
