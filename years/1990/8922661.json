 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to the California Institute of Technology                       supports the Los Angeles Number Theory Group, a research activity               in the category of Mathematical Sciences Research Groups. The                   four principal members of the Group are Professors Dinakar                      Ramakrishnan of Caltech, and Haruzo Hida, Jonathan Rogawski, and                Don Blasius of the University of California, Los Angeles. The                   purpose of the award is to make possible visits to the greater                  Los Angeles area by outside researchers in the field of                         automorphic forms and representations.                                               Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
