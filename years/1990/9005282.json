 "awd_abstract_narration": "The small proteglycans are major components of bone, skin,                      tendon, cartilage and other connective tissues as well as being                 vital to cell: matrix interactions.  It has been demonstrated                   that the small proteglycan II of bone binds to the \"D\" bands                    of the gap region of type I collagen fibrils and controls the                   rate of formation and the final size of these fibers.  It is                    not known which region of the PGII of bovine bone has been                      cloned and sequenced.  Therefore, the gene encoding PGII will                   be isolated, the intron/exon structure determined and the                       regulatory motifs (promoter, enhancers) identified and                          characterized.  The process of isolation will involve \"gene                     walking\", or utilizing sequences of one genomic clone to                        isolate and identify another.  These overlapping clones will                    be mapped in detail using restriction endonucleases and                         synthetic oligonucleotides.  The 5' donor and 3' acceptor                       splice sites for intron/exon boundaries will be identified,                     isolated and sequenced.  Exon specific nucleotide sequences                     will be utilized to make synthetic peptides.  These peptides                    will then be utilized to determine the locations of specific                    activities of the various regions of the protein (i.e. collagen                 binding sites).  The promoter will be utilized in                               transformation studies of cultured bone (PGII  protein                          producing) and kidney (non-producing) cells in the absence and                  presence of estrogen, vitamin D and phorbol esters.  Results                    of these studies will identify specific structural and                          functional domains of the protein, and provide a means by which                 the regulation of expression of the PGII gene can be                            studied.***",
