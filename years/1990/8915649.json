 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of eight U.S.                         mathematics education researchers in a joint U.S.-Japan                         seminar on \"Cross-cultural Perspective on Computational                         Alternatives to Paper-Pencil Computations for the 21st                          Century.\"  Paper-and-pencil computation has traditionally been                  central to elementary school mathematics programs in the U.S.                   and Japan (and elsewhere), and paper-pencil algorithms                          designed to produce exact answers have long dominated the way                   computation has been taught.  However, it is becoming                           increasingly apparent that alternative forms of computation,                    such as the use of calculators, mental computation, and                         estimation, deserve more attention in the elementary mathematics                curriculum.  The widespread availability and use of the hand-                   held calculator provides an efficient and low-cost means for                    finding exact answers to problems that would otherwise                          involve tedious paper-and-pencil calculations.  Mental                          computation is a useful option in some problems, and has been                   especially valued and emphasized in Japanese mathematics                        education.  For many real-world situations, estimation is a                     still better approach.  Mental computation and estimation are                   generally recognized as making use of higher-order thinking                     skills as well as providing many opportunities for mathematical                 problem solving; both are likely to assume more significant                     roles in mathematics education in the years ahead.  It is the                   purpose of this seminar to bring leading mathematics education                  researchers in the two countries together to describe and                       exchange the results of recent research on these alternatives,                  to identify the curricular and instructional implications of                    the results, and to discuss ways this knowledge can be used to                  establish a better balance among these computational                            alternatives within elementary school mathematics programs in                   both countries.                                                                                                                                                 The seminar will be held August 13-17, 1990, in Honolulu, HI                    under the auspices of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Science                        Program.  Co-organizers are Dr. Robert E. Reys, Professor of                    Mathematics Education, University of Missouri-Columbia, and                     Dr. Nobuhiko Nohda, Professor, Institute of Education,                          University of Tsukuba, Japan.",
