 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile animals often move through complex environments on regular               migratory routes between their shelters, feeding places, and                    breeding sites.  The mechanisms underlying such migrations are                  poorly understood.  Coral-reef fishes that migrate daily between                different places in one local area offer an outstanding                         opportunity to study these mechanisms.                                                                                                                          The doctoral-dissertation research of Anthony I. Mazeroll will                  investigate the mechanisms underlying the local daily migrations                of brown surgeonfish during the summer spawning season in the                   northern Red Sea (Gulf of Aqaba, Israel).  Mr. Mazeroll will                    conduct experiments designed to reveal the roles of learning,                   memory, and cognitive maps in these migratory movements.                                                                                                        This research will provide valuable information about the various               factors influencing local migrations of animals.  It will also                  reveal details about the abilities of animals to learn and                      remember physical features of their environments, and will                      thereby contribute to a small but important body of knowledge                   about the role of learning in natural populations.",
