 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns a fundamental study of the effect of low                 levels of copolymers on the properties of aqueous colloidal                     suspensions.  Systematically designed, novel, block and graft                   copolymers with narrow molecular-weight distributions of each                   block will be synthesized and mixed with selected colloidal                     particles having narrow-size distributions.  The effect of the                  adsorbed copolymers on the stability and properties of the                      suspensions will be measured by techniques including rheology and               light scattering.  The particle concentrations will range from                  dilute to highly concentrated in order to study the critical                    effect of particle concentration on suspension microstructure.                  Steric stability is provided by a water-soluble tail segment on                 the copolymer that is anchored to the particle by an adsorbed                   hydrophobic head block.  The effectiveness of the water-insoluble               block as an anchor will be studied as a function of chemical                    structure.  It is anticipated that specific interactions between                the particle surface and the adsorbed copolymer will be of                      particular importance in aqueous, hydrogen-bonding media.  In                   addition to the steric stabilization mechanism, electrostatic                   stabilization is also important for the case of charged tail                    segments.  The particles to be studied will be well-characterized               inorganic materials, primarily SiO2, Al2O3, SiC, and Si3N4.",
