 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research is to perform a systematic study of               the deep level defects in compound semiconductors known as \"DX                  Centers\".  The thrust of the research is to determine the atomic                nature of the defects and to obtain information on the local                    electronic nature, so as to formulate a detailed microscopic                    model.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy and Mossbauer effect                      spectroscopy are used to study gallium aluminum arsenide doped to               various levels with tin and tellurium so as to produce shallow                  donor states, neutral \"DX Centers\" and ionized \"DX Centers\".                    High quality, single crystal gallium aluminum arsenide are being                prepared by metallorganic chemical vapor deposition at the                      Laboratory for Solid State Physics and Solar Energy in Valbonne,                France.  The electrical behavior of the materials is                            characterized using Hall effect measurements.  Photoemission,                   quantitative Auger electron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass                 spectroscopy are used to characterize the chemical composition                  and doping levels.                                                                                                                                                   The development of many promising devices using gallium                    aluminum arsenide compound semiconductors has been impeded                      substantially by difficulties in producing highly-conductive                    wide-band gap materials.  Dopants that are commonly used cause                  deep level \"DX Center\" defects which are associated with                        deleterious properties such as persistent photoluminescence,                    reduced minority carrier lifetimes and recombination                            efficiencies.",
