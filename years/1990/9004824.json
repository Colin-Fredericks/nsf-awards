 "awd_abstract_narration": "Models of the long-term, global carbon cycle have lacked a                      geographic dimension; model input and output have been restricted               to global-mean values.  Climate change on million-year time scales              can be driven by redistribution of the continents and their                     weathering lithologies (as this affects atmospheric pCO2).  This                project will explore the nature of Phanerozoic climate change by                performing several new climate simulations.  Runs at different                  pCO2's for the same time periods will elucidate the relationship                between global temperature and runoff (the two most important                   variables affecting chemical weathering rates and thus pCO2).                   These climate variables will then be used in calculations of global             weathering rates, using paleogeologic maps prepared during our                  previous research.  In addition, two other important factors,                   topography (relief) and biological enhancement of chemical                      weathering rates, will be assessed, using present-day observations              of their affect on soil and stream chemistry, and by assembling and             reconstructing paleophytogeographies.  The goal of this research                is to create a realistic, coupled model of climate and                          biogeochemical cycles that can be used to investigate the                       geographic and temporal variability of Phanerozoic climate.",
