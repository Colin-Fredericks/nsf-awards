 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Group of physicists consisting of three faculty, two                     research associates and five graduate students is performing                    experiments to study the details of the strong interactions                     among elementary particles.  The program consists of three                      major components:                                                               1. Experiment E776 at the Brookhaven Alternating Gradient                       Synchrotron.  A large sample of about one billion events                        produced through the interaction protons with protons and                       neutrons with protons is being studied.  A variety of important                 physics topics is being investigated in a detail never before                   possible.                                                                       2. A new approach to massive computation and on-line data                       acquisition.  To achieve the sensitivity required, the group                    has developed and is now implementing a hardware computational                  system that acts in consort with the data acquisition.  The                     system has achieved 41 gigaoperations per second (compared to 1                 giga=operation per second for a Cray X-MP) and data bandwidths                  of 32 gigabytes per second.  This performance has been achieved                 at about 2% of the cost of a Cray X-MP.                                         3. Experiment E609 at the Fermilab Tevatron. Much of the                        apparatus from the Brookhaven experiment has been moved to                      Fermilab where the program will continue at higher energy.  The                 full power of the hardware will be used to investigate rare                     phenomena.",
