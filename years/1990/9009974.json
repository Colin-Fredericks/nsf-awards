 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regional patterns of climate and environmental response in                 southwestern North America during the pivotal millennia of the end of           the Pleistocene epoch, and the relations of that regional pattern to            global climate change continue to be nationally and internationally             important research topics.  The Sierra Nevadas of eastern California            are a major climatic and vegetational boundary today, but at the end of         the last ice age Great Basin-like vegetation coverered lower slopes on          both sides of the southern Sierra Nevada.  In this project, the                 investigator will collect, date, and examine lake-core chronologies             from four lakes west of the Sierra crest in eastern Calfornia in order          to evaluate two competing hypotheses that explain why the western               Sierra was drier and the eastern Sierra was wetter at the end of the            last glacial period.  The first hypothesis argues that enhanced                 monsoonal activity was due to greater summer insolation and an enhanced         land-sea thermal contrast.  The second alternative explains the                 northern aridity and the southern moistness by a southward displacement         of the winter jet stream.                                                                                                                                            The study will illuminate our understanding of the late Quaternary         vegetation history of arid North America and the climatic patterns that         have influenced it.  This knowledge will increase our understanding of          processes of climatic and vegetation change and the ways the regional           changes relate to global changes.",
