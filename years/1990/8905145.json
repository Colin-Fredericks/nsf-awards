 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for a conference on The Biological                  Role of Extracellular ATP to be sponsored by the New York Academy               of Sciences.  Effects of extracellular ATP on the in vivo and in                vitro functions of a variety of tisssue and organ systems have                  been known for over 20 years.  Modification of the contractile                  responses of cardiac muscle and vascular and visceral smooth                    muscle in the presence of exogenous ATP have been particularly                  well characterized.  More recently, extracellular ATP at                        nanomolar to micromolar concentrations has been shown to trigger,               modulate, or inhibit physiological responses in a much broader                  range of non-contractile tissue and cell types including exocrine               and endocrine secretory tissues, vascular endothelium, epithelial               cell types, phagocytic cells, hepatocytes, and certain                          nerve/neuronal preparations.  Furthermore, studies using state-                 of-the-art methods for monitoring receptor-mediated signalling                  events in single cells or in highly homogeneous cultured cell                   systems have demonstrated that extracellular ATP can trigger                    activation of several well-defined transmembrane signalling                     effector systems.  Since ATP is stored in, and can be released                  from, a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal secretory granules,                these past and recent observations strongly suggest that ATP may                be a physiologically significant inter-cellular signalling agent                which exerts its functional effects via interaction with specific               cell surface receptors.  Increasingly, scientists investigating                 these various aspects of the biological role of extracellular ATP               represent a much wider range of disciplines (cellular physiology,               neurobiology, endocrinology, and immunology) than the smooth                    muscle pharmacology which previously dominated the field.  Since                previous conferences in this general area have been focused on                  the effects of adenosine and ATP on smooth muscle or                            cardiovascular biology, many of the recent studies on ATP-induced               actions in other tissue and cell types have never been discussed                in a focused conference setting.  The proposed conference will                  provide such a setting.  There will be sessions concerned with                  the following topics:  1) the effects of ATP on the integrated,                 specialized functions of various excitable and non-excitable cell               types, 2) ATP chemistry and the classification of ATP effects and               the receptors mediating these effects, 3) the coupling of ATP                   receptors to specific transmembrane signalling mechanisms, 4) the               sources of extracellular ATP, and 5) the metabolism of                          extracellular ATP by ecto-enzymes.                                                                                                                              This conference on the biological role of extracellular ATP will                provide a forum for the multi-disciplinary discussion of the                    increasing number of studies which indicate that extracellular                  ATP may have important inter-cellular signalling and regulatory                 roles in diverse biological systems.",
