 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main body of control literature has dealt with the                          development of controller design techniques for linear time-                    invariant systems.  Nonlinearities encountered in a process                     model have usually been treated as uncertainties resulting                      from the linearization of that model around a steady state.                     Most of the real processes in chemicals manufacturing are                       inherently nonlinear due to, for example, the exponential form                  of the rate equations' dependance on temperature, hold-up on                    trays in distillation columns, etc.                                                                                                                             The objective of this project is to develop controller design                   methodologies for continuous-time nonlinear processes.                          Process modelling uncertainty, disturbance uncertainty, and                     hard constraints on process inputs and outputs will be                          explicitly considered.  The overall controller design problem                   will be formulated as a weighted minmax problem, whose                          solution will not be interpreted as \"worst-case\" design, but                    will be shown to generate one of the noninferior solutions to                   a naturally occurring multi-objective optimization problem.                     Investigation of the solvability and of theoretical properties                  of the minmax problem will be undertaken through a number of                    case studies on chemical and biochemical reactors and                           distillation columns, all of which are known to present                         nonlinearities.  Nonsmooth calculus of variations will be used                  to perform the maximization of the objective function with                      respect to closed loop input signals, while nonlinear                           programming will be employed to carry out the minimization                      with respect to the controller, the latter modelled through                     finite Volterra series.",
