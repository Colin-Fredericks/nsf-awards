 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two main objectives.  The first is to understand               why commonly used securities do not contain the kinds of                        contingencies that theory suggests are needed for efficient risk-               sharing.  In particular, we do not observe securities, such as                  income bonds, that make payoffs contingent on readily available                 accounting information.  The project explores a number of                       possible explanations for these phenomena.  The second objective                is to extend earlier work by the investigators on the incentives                to introduce new securities and the principals that should guide                their design, to get a deeper understanding of the market                       institutions that promote efficient innovation.  The project                    emphasizes the question of why there is a tendency to standardize               contracts or securities.                                                                                                                                        This pathbreaking work is opening up a new and important line of                research in financial economics and it could eventually change                  the way markets are studied.  Economic theorists have shown                     empirically that markets are incomplete and theoretically that                  this incompleteness can lead to inefficient decisions and market                instability.  But most of the past research starts by assuming                  incomplete markets, while this project shows that it is possible                to explain the specific features of incomplete financial markets                (e.g., no income bonds, use of a few standard securities) as the                consequences of rational behavior under uncertainty.  The                       research also promises useful new insights into the relationship                between managerial incentive contracts and stock prices.  The                   types of general equilibrium models developed by these                          investigators for the study of the microstructure of financial                  markets could eventually be used to study other types of                        incomplete markets.",
