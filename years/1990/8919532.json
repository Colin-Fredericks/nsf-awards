 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will investigate possible physiological               influences on non-ovulatory sexual behavior in humans.  Previous                work suggests that a woman's temporal pattern of heterosexual                   activity may optimize her reproductive cycle through an effect on               ovulation or the luteal phase of her cycle.  Possible pathways                  suggested for this effect include the action of olfactory                       pheromones and the vaginal absorption of components of seminal                  fluid.  Investigation of patterns of sleeping with a man (which                 involves close proximity) and the use of condoms or coitus                      interruptus (which prevent the transfer of seminal fluid) will                  help determine whether the mechanism is olfactory or seminal.                        The current study will employ a large sample of heterosexual               women who will keep daily records across their menstrual cycles.                The relationships among ovulation, luteal phase length, cycle                   length, pattern of sexual activity, birth control method, and                   pattern of sleeping with a man will be analyzed using appropriate               statistical tests.  The proposed study should resolve many of the               problems with previous studies and clarify the association                      between sociosexual behavior and reproductive physiology in                     women.  If a pheromonal or seminal mechanism regulating human                   female reproductive cycle is supported, the results may suggest a               possible remedy for people seeking assistance with problems of                  infertility.",
