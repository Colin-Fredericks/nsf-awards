 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semantic analysis is automated analysis of programs, used to predict            their runtime behavior.  Such analysis is complicated by the inherent           difficulty of determining semantic properties of programs.  Existing            semantic analysis methods, such as data flow analysis and dependence            analysis, deal with this problem by seeking relatively weak semantic            information.  While these methods are efficient and useful, they                suffer from two drawbacks.  First, many have not been justified                 rigorously.  The second drawback is the weakness of the semantic                information they provide.  To rectify these drawbacks, this project             will investigate (1) the development of new semantic analysis methods           based on analyzing path executability conditions and formal                     specifications and proofs; (2) the development of new applications of           semantic analysis; and (3) the development of prototype systems to              demonstrate new semantic analysis methods and applications.",
