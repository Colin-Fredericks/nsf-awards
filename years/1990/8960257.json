 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to show that commercially available           relational database management systems (RDBMS) would be better suited           as a platform for integrated, full-phase computer-aided software                engineering (CASE) products if they provided more sophisticated data            integrity checking.  Most CASE product development includes its own             data management; those few products which do utilize a standard RDBMS           tend to be of smaller and more limited scope.  Using a standard RDBMS           and an open architecture would allow CASE tools to be developed by              persons with broader ranges of expertise and experience, would                  facilitate new RDBMS advances to be made available immediately to the           CASE product without added effort or cost, and would encourage the              central CASE data to be integrated with the remainder of the corporate          information.                                                                                                                                                    The tasks of this research include:  (l) to show that all the                   functionality that is available in current products can be replicated           in a RDBMS with an extended constraint  management subsystem, (2) to            simulate that subsystem using a commercial RDBMS, and (3) to define the         minimum set of integrity constraint functions which must be                     implemented.",
