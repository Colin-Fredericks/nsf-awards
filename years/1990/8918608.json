 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research is to test                    predictive models regarding the effects of boundary layer flow                  on the ecology of larval black flies, important stream insects.                 Specifically, the project will determine the direct effects of                  drag, average velocity, local flow disturbances and background                  turbulence on larval behavior, growth and distribution, as well                 as the indirect effects of flow on competition and predator-prey                interactions.                                                                   Black fly larvae are excellent experimental subjects for                        laboratory and field studies, because they rapidly respond to                   changes in flow, have high feeding and growth rates, and occur in               dense populations in local streams.  Video equipment will record                larval feeding and spacing behavior, submerged force plates will                measure larval drag, and hot film anemometry will characterize                  the fluid environment on spatial and temporal scales that are                   relevant to these small stream organisms.                                       The results will represent a significant advance in boundary                    layer hydromechanics and stream ecology.  The field studies are                 important because they will be the first to quantify the                        influence of small-scale turbulence on benthic organisms.                       Results will allow evaluation of adaptive paradigms and                         assessment of the non-catastrophic costs of drag.  The                          information from this study will provide important insights that                may be applied to physical ecology of other benthic organisms.",
