 "awd_abstract_narration": "Factors influencing the dynamics of aquatic populations have been               studied for decades.  Understandably, physical and biological                   factors that are best quantified are those that have received the               most attention.  A factor that has been severely neglected by                   investigators is disease.  It is inarguable that disease may                    affect organismic performance and reduce ecological potential.                  In this research, Dr. Lonsdale will examine an affliction at the                level of its effects on individual organisms and the demography                 of populations.  Her research will focus on Scottolana                          canadensis, a widespread, estuarine copepod. An affliction in S.                canadensis that can render females unable to reproduce. Dr.                     Lonsdale's experience with the ecology and culture of this                      copepod will permit a variety of experiments designed to                        determine the cause of the affliction and its potential for                     affecting the abundance of this species.  The methodology                       includes histological examinations of healthy and afflicted                     copepods with light and electron microscopy and life-table                      experiments using anti-biotics to help characterize the agent                   responsible for pathogenesis.  To test the hypothesis that the                  affliction negatively impact copepod growth, Dr. Lonsdale will                  conduct bi-weekly sampling of S. canadensis from environmentally                \"stressed\" and \"pristine\" estuaries on Long Island.",
