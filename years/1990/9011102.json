It concerns                                     the observed performance of six sanitary                                        landfills located within the Loma Prieta                                        earthquake damage zone.                                                                                                                                         Immediately following the Loma Prieta                                           earthquake, these landfills were inspected                                      for damage and evidence of slope movement,                                      and the observations recorded.  The                                             objectives of this research program are: (1)                                    to estimate the mean peak ground acceleration                                   that these landfills were subjected to during                                   the earthquake; (2) use these estimated                                         ground accelerations in a deformation                                           analysis; (3) compare the predicted                                             deformations with the observed conditions;                                      and (4) based upon this comparison, to assess                                   the validity of the input parameters and the                                    analytical techniques used.",
