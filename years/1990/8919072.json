 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a relatively brief period, the central United States                        witnessed a florescence of prehistoric culture focussed on the                  Mississippi river site of Cahokia.  The site, which dates to                    approximately 1000 A.D., may have been inhabited by up to 50,000                individuals.  It likely controlled a stretch of river and                       hinterland of 250 miles in length, and the construction of temple               mounds indicates a stratified society with complex religious                    ritual.  Dr. Milner and his students will conduct archaeological                research which will provide insight into the Cahokia phenomenon                 and set it into a broader regional context.                                                                                                                     Over the course of two summers, Dr. Milner, assisted by two                     graduate students, will visit and study materials from a series                 of Cahokia related sites located in the Mississippi River                       floodplain and adjacent tributary drainages.  Although they will                visit many sites to examine surface remains and geographical                    situation, they will rely primarily on data collected by previous               excavators.  They will work at a number of institutions which                   house such materials and study both field maps and notes as well                as excavated remains.  In particular they will focus on ceramics                and examine a large body of data using a single recording and                   analysis scheme.  This will allow direct cross site comparison.                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 address the archaeologically significant question of how such                   complex societies as Cahokia arise and are maintained.  Some                    archaeologists have argued that the site of Cahokia itself                      exercised direct and tight control over outlying settlements.                   Others postulate a more indirect rule with a significant degree                 of local autonomy.  Secondly, the project will make maximal use                 of data collected by many investigators over a number of years,                 and thus increases the significance and contribution of past                    work.  Finally, the project will assist in the scientific                       training of two graduate students.",
