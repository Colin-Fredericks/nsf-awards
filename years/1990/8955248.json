 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Program for Leadership in Earth Systems Education is a                      cooperative effort among national, regional and local leaders                   in earth science education.  The project's national                             coordinating center will be at Ohio State University.                                                                                                           Teacher teams, each including an upper elementary, a middle                     or junior high school and a senior high school teacher will                     be selected from each of the 50 states and prepared at one of                   two regional centers (an Eastern Center at Ohio State                           University and a Western Center at Northern Colorado                            University) each conducting three-week long summer workshops.                                                                                                   During the four-years of the project, 64 teachers will be                       prepared with updated activities and information regarding                      Planet Earth.  Teams will select exemplary instructional                        materials dealing broadly with planet Earth systems using as                    a guide a K-12 syllabus prepared by a national planning                         committee of teachers, science educators, and scientists and                    modified by the teams for appropriateness for their own                         locality.  The syllabus will have been based on a framework                     of goals and concepts identified at a Conference of Educators                   and Geoscientists held in April, 1988, supplemented by plant                    Earth understandings obtained from an analysis of Project                       2061, Phase I results.  Participants may earn six-semester                      hours of graduate credit.                                                                                                                                       Teams will identify a local school administrator and a local                    college liaison as resource agents.  Both will be invited to                    attend a conference on the objectives of the program held                       during the last week of the teams' summer workshop.  Together                   the three team members and the two liaisons will act as a                       mutual support group to provide a stimulus for improving                        curriculum and instruction regarding planet Earth systems                       and, since all teaching levels above the fourth grade are                       represented, provide an articulated approach in their                           schools, locales and states.                                                                                                                                    Subsequent to the completion of their summer workshop, each                     team will conduct a minimum of two workshops in their state                     and locality using their syllabus and correlated teaching                       materials.  Workshops on appropriate regional versions of the                   planet Earth syllabi and teaching materials will also be                        offered at each of the regional and national meetings of the                    NSTA.  As a result, some 4000 teachers will have been                           directly assisted by the project over its life-span.                                                                                                            Communication between all participants and staff, and the                       earth science education community at large, will be                             facilitated through networking consisting of a newsletter and                   an electronic Earth Systems Education Conference (using PSI-                    NET) both of which will be maintained by Ohio State                             University beyond the end of the project.                                                                                                                       Cost sharing in an amount of $158,870 equals 15% of the NSF                     award.",
