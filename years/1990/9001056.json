 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Sandra Greer is supported by a grant from the                         Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the density,                   heat capacity and phase equilibria of polymerizing liquids; she                 will also be testing a number of theoretical models that may be                 applicable to them. This work will help us to understand how                    and why polymerization occurs ultimately allowing us to design                  and produce better plastics, synthetic oils and clothing                        materials.                                                                                                                                                      Greer is pursuing a two pronged attack to find out firstly, if                  certain theoretical models that have been proposed do in fact                   correctly predict the behavior of reversible polymerization.                    These systems often refered to as \"living polymers\" because the                 polymer-monomer equilbrium can be reversibly shifted by                         temperature changes; thus, mimicking chemical equilbrium                        behavior. Secondly, Greer will examine the concept of Wheeler                   et al. that the static properties (density and heat capacity)                   can, in fact, be treated as critical phenomena. Moreover, Greer                 hopes to see whether or not the theories used to predict and                    describe phase transitions in magnets can also be used to                       describe her \"living polymer\" systems' reversible equilibria                    properties.",
