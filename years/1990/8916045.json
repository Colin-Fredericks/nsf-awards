 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to undertake a detailed petrogenetic study of               an exceptionally well exposed section through a major layered                   pluton of massif-type anorthosite:  the Paul Island intrusion,                  Nain, Labrador.  Most mapping and sampling and much preliminary                 petrography and geochemistry have been completed.  The Intrusion                displays a stratigraphic section about km thick that contains                   most of the textural and compositional varieties of massif-type                 anorthosite and a comfortable lens (1.5 km thick) of the most                   primitive mafic cumulates in the Nain complex.  Characteristics                 of the earliest unit suggest crystallization of about 50%                       plagioclase at great depth prior to diapiric emplacement.  Later,               fluid replenishments established a chamber that permitted bottom                accumulation of anorthosite.  Zoning of phenocrysts in the                      uppermost unit implies that plagioclase remained suspended within               an actively convecting, periodically replenished chamber.  Many                 fine-grained anorthosite and mafic dikes have compositions and                  occurrences that are appropriate for parental liquids to                        different cumulate units.                                                            The major goals of this study are:  (1) to establish the                   character and origin of parental magmas to the anorthosites, (2)                to establish the state of the magma and the mode of emplacement,                and (3) to understand processes that operated in anorthositic                   magma chambers.",
