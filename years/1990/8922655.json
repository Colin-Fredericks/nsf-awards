 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major challenges facing molecular geneticists,                       developmental biologists, and pathologists is understanding the                 mechanisms which control tissue specific gene expression in higher              animals.  During the past few years, we have seen extensive                     progress in this direction.  A variety of novel in vivo and in                  vitro in cell-type specific gene expression were identified and the             genes encoding such factors were isolated.  The hormonal and                    developmental mechanisms controlling the activity of these                      regulatory genes are subject to extensive investigation as well as              the alteration of these basic controls in various disease states.               This proposal requests funds to finance a summer FASEB conference               on the topic of Regulation of Tissue Specific Gene Expression in                Higher Animals.  The purpose of this meeting is to congregate                   researchers actively engaged in studying various aspects of tissue              specific gene expression.  In addition to discussing the basic                  mechanisms of gene regulation, special emphasis will be placed on               discussion of both normal and aberrant gene regulation in the                   following organ systems; liver and pancreas, muscle, blood and the              nervous system.  We will also have special sessions dealing with                the regulation of development and embryogenesis.   The emphasis                 will be on gene regulation in vertebrates and especially in                     mammals, however, where appropriate, we have invited leading                    investigators, studying gene regulation in lower organisms, which               are more amenable to genetic analysis.  The conference will be held             at Copper Mountain, Colorado from July 8-13, 1990.  The meeting is              designed to have formal slide presentations, informal poster                    sesions, a workshop, periods of group discussions, and plenty of                opportunity for individual interaction.  The conference will                    summarize the current understanding of tissue specific gene                     expression and should lead to dissemination of new information and              new strategies for further research.",
