 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focusses on theoretical and experimental                          investigations on tetrahedrally co-ordinated II-VI semiconductors               (including diluted magnetic semiconductors:  DMS's) and their                   heterostructures as well as II-VI/III-V and III-V                               heterostructures, the heterostructures being grown by molecular                 beam epitaxy (MBE).  The investigations will address fundamental                issues such as the nature of the ground and excited states of                   the transition metal (magnetic) ions in the tetrahedral                         environment of the II-VI semiconductors; the spin-spin exchange                 interaction between the magnetic ions and the band electrons;                   long range order; and electronic states of donors and acceptors.                The new physics associated with MBE-grown quantum well structures               will be studied in the context of the reduced dimensionality,                   interfaces, band off-sets and elastic strains.  Raman, Brillouin,               infrared and modulation spectroscopy will be exploited to                       discover and delineate the collective and localized excitations,                with and without external perturbation (stress and magnetic).                   Theoretical investigations in parallel will provide motivation                  and framework for special lines of investigation and analysis of                experimental results.",
