 "awd_abstract_narration": "In every age of science, there are towering figures who \"know\"                  virtually everyone and influence research in a vast area of                     science.  In early science, Mersenne held such a position,                      later it was the Secretary of the Royal Society, Flamsteed.                     The Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences played a                        similar role.  Indeed, these positions at the institutional                     center of science continue to play a critical role.  Today,                     it is the President of the National Academy of Sciences, the                    President's Science Advisor and, potentially, the Director of                   the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                                                This project, directed by Professors Michael Crowe and Barbara                  Turpin, is aimed at the preparation and publication of a                        calendar of the correspondence of one of these central figures                  in science, Sir John Herschel (1792-1871).  Herschel                            personally made important contributions to astronomy,                           mathematics, physics, photochemistry, philosophy of science,                    and scientific organization.  There are approximately 15,000                    letters between Hershel and the leading scientists around the                   world from about 1820 to his death.  The calendar will provide                  information on the name of the correspondent, date, location                    and repository identification mark and a brief summary (about                   25 words) on each of the 15,000 letters.  They will also                        prepare a biographical register of correspondents and of                        persons mentioned in the summaries, a name and subject index,                   and other supportive material.  As the Calendar of the Darwin                   Correspondence has demonstrated, such a calendar for the major                  figures in science is an invaluable tool for historians,                        philosophers and social scientists who try to trace the                         development of science in the modern world.",
