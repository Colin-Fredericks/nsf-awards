Gaines will                      investigate the mechanisms of reactions of boron-containing                     cluster molecules and also synthesize new molecules of this                     type. In addition to providing a deeper understanding of this                   important area of chemistry, the results have potential                         applications in energy storage and solid state materials.                                                                                                       This project combines exploratory synthetic investigations of                   boron hydride cluster molecules and their derivatives with                      investigations of the mechanisms of their formation,                            rearrangement and reactions. The mechanisms of reactions and                    rearrangements of selected derivatives of borane and carborane                  clusters will be investigated using stereospecific boron                        isotopic labeling as the diagnostic probe and B-10 and B-11 NMR                 spectroscopic analysis. New routes and mechanistic pathways for                 the mono- and polyalkylation of boranes will be developed using                 a variety of approaches based on recent new catalysts and                       alkylating agents. The long-lived intermediate formed during                    the hydridic reduction of boron-halogen bonds by trialkyltin                    hydrides will be characterized. Novel classes of group-V-                       containing heteroatom boron clusters will be prepared using                     alternative strategies such as simultaneous insertion of boron                  and nitrogen, extensions of the strategies used recently to                     prepare new types of nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing borane                 clusters.",
