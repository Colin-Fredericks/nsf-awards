 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is to develop through                    genetic engineering technology a family of \"affinity                            bioadhesives\" for specific eukaryotic cell attachment                           applications. In an ongoing research program, Genex has produced                a series of recombinant adhesive proteins based on the                          polyphenolic protein of the blue mussel. In Phase I of the                      program proposed herein Dr. Link plans to extend this technology                to the area of cell culture attachment by developing novel                      fusion proteins which she terms \"affinity bioadhesives\". To                     accomplish this she will assemble hybrid genes that encode fusion               proteins carrying the cell attachment region of human fibronectin               fused with the engineered mussel adhesive. These fusion proteins                will be expressed in yeast, purified and evaluated for their                    adhesive and cell attachment properties. These first engineered                 affinity bioadhesives will test the feasibility of the approach.                %%%                                                                             Affinity bioadhesives have potential application in cell culture                research and large scale culture of mammalian cells.",
