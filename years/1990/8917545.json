 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although genetic algorithms (GAs) have often provided solutions                 in situations where there are few applicable techniques, they are               not well understood and remain primarily an art rather than a                   science.  This work is directed at deepening theoretical                        understanding of GA performance with particular emphasis on                     representational issues.  The representational change operators                 underlying the research are directed at overcoming schemata                     deceptiveness.  Research goals include:  1.  The development of a               theory schemata analysis which encompasses representational                     transformations to characterize and analyze the difficulty of GA                problems without involving Walsh transforms.  2.  The derivation                of theoretical and empirical estimates of the density of                        representations that enable successful genetic search of various                classes of functions.  3.  The development and demonstration of                 guidelines for using invertible linear transformations to induce                representational changes likely to make difficult GA functional                 optimization easier while not confounding already easy problems.                4.  The development and demonstration of a fast parallel                        algorithm which exploits alternate problem formulations while                   simultaneously involving them in an evolutionary process of                     directed search through a space of representations.  This work                  should lead to the solution  of problems which previously did not               yield to the genetic paradigm, and should increase understanding                of representational issues in search.",
