 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global climate changes occur naturally over long periods of                     time, but recent measurements and theories indicate that man                    is accelerating these changes as a result of                                    industrialization.  Since these changes may be irreversible,                    it is essential that they be predictable and that society                       adjusts to avoid possible catastrophic consequences.  Support                   is being provided for a national workshop to identify the                       engineering research needed to ensure the implications of                       decisions made are fully understood.  Attendees will be                         invited from all engineering disciplines to become better                       informed on this multi-disciplinary problem, and to contribute                  their expertise to a rational and orderly response.                                                                                                             The workshop on the engineering response to global climate                      change will be held in June, 1990.  Proceedings will be                         disseminated to help guide future research efforts.",
