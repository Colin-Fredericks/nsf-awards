 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of female criminality is still in its infancy.  There                 is much that remains to be understood and explained about women's               crime.  There is some literature on contemporary women criminals.               Historical accounts, sensitive to the social construction of                    crime, however, are almost nonexistent.  Yet, such study is                     essential to comprehending fully gender and social control.                                                                                                     This research uses the courts in Paris during the 19th century as               an arena for examining the interactions and assumptions regarding               female crime.  Through systematic analysis of court dossiers,                   monograph and journal literature, and official reports and                      statistics, the meaning of female criminality will be traced and                compared to male criminality.  The investigation will include an                analysis of why particular discourses about the female criminal                 emerged, who the contenders were who sought to attribute meaning                to female deviancy, how changes in institutions and practices                   affected female offenders, and how activity related to the female               criminal served broader efforts to stabilize gender and class                   relations.  Several theoretical perspectives are woven together:                changes in standards of criminal responsibility; the role of the                expert in defining norms; narrative representations of crime; the               meaning of patterns of conviction and acquittal; and the role of                the courts in articulating \"the woman question.\"                                                                                                                This study should reveal the ways in which penal practices and                  procedures mediated and reflected larger processes of social and                political redefinition.  In addition, the research promises to                  break new ground, theoretically and methodologically, by drawing                on recent theoretical advances across several disciplines to                    examine an important but rarely studied topic.  Finally, this                   work can have a major impact on the way social scientists define                and study criminality by providing a model in which gender is no                longer absent or peripheral to the analysis.",
