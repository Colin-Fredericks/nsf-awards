He will investigate as to whether products               of two closed 1-connected manifolds must have positive Ricci                    curvature when each has such curvature.  And he will investigate                the problem of whether closed 1-connected 5-manifolds carry                     metrics with positive Ricci curvature.                                               The study of differential geometry has focused on problems                 concerning curvature for over a century.  Today there are several               competing notions of curvature including sectional, Gauss, and                  Ricci.  Recently, in collaboration, the principal investigator                  constructed a complete Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci                  curvature which did not have non-negative sectional curvature.                  In this project he will study related questions for hypersurfaces               of dimension four and five.",
