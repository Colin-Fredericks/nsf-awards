 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for the                                                                                                    preparation of ultrafine magnetic oxides of uniforms size                       which are mainly used in computer data storage, audio and                       video recording, magnetic fluids and fabrication of certain                     microwave devices.  The difficulty of obtaining uniform-sized                                                                                                   nanoparticles of magnetic oxides stems from the fact that                       their preparations are mostly done in bulk aqueous media in                     which uncontrolled nucleation and grain growth cannot be                        prevented.  Synthesis of these compounds (gamma-Fe2O3, Fe3O4,                                                                                                   CrO2, Cobalt doped Fe2O3 and barium ferrite) in constrained                     microreactors such as the aqueous cores of water-in-oil                         microemulsions or the inner part of single-compartment                          vesicles seems to be a promising alternative although these                     techniques are still under development.                                                                                                                         In this project, methods are used to optimize and control the                                                                                                   ultralow size and the narrow particle size distribution by                      proper modulation of certain physico-chemical conditions of                     the microemulsion and vesicular systems.  Further, the project                                                                                                  examines how to make quantitative correlations between the                      morphology (size, shape, and size-distribution) and structure                                                                                                   of the product microparticles and the physico-chemical                          properties of the surfactant system.  The results of the study                  delineate the similarities as well as the differences between                   the two types of microreactors (microemulsions and vesicles)                    in relation to chemical reactions in them.  The solid                           precipitate obtained from such microreactors may be different                   from that precipitated in a large aqueous medium.  Not only                     might these experiments lead to the production of                               monodispersed ultrafine magnetic particles, but they might                      also provide a greater fundamental understanding of                             interfacial chemistry in relation to nucleation and crystal                     growth in microreactors.   This project exploits the expertise                  of two                                                                          research groups (Rhode Island and University of Florida).",
