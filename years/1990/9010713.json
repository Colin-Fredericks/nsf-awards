In this study, the PI will interview                  75-100    Janbaz - Iranian soldiers who volunteered for                         repeated suicide    missions, and survived.  Autobiographical                   reports, trait measures, and other inter- and intrapersonal                     assessments should   yield some very interesting and                            potentially useful insights into  behavior under extreme                        environmental stress.  Equally of interest will be the                          soldiers' rationalizations of their \"failure,\" along  with                      their retrospective accounts of their contribution to their                     country.  This population offers a very rare opportunity to                     study first-hand the antecedents of exceptional altruism.  Most                 populations of this type do not survive the activity for which                  they volunteered, of course, and thus, the Janbaz offer a rare                  and important opportunity for research.  This study has the                     potential to contribute to the store of fundamental knowledge                   about behavior under extreme stress, and the antecedents of                     this  form of selfless altruism.  It promises to enrich the                     insights of researchers across many of the social sciences.",
