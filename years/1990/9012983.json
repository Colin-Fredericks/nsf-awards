 "awd_abstract_narration": "The author of this SGER Proposal aims to synthesize and                         characterize a new class of laser materials for the visible and                 near infrared spectral region.  The solid-state synthesis of                    compounds consisting of reduced rare earth metal phosphates will                be pursued, with the emphasis of this effort on the lower valent                rare earth metal cations such as scandium and yttrium in an oxo-                type phosphate anion framework.  Growing single crystals and                    characterizing new phases by techniques such as powder or single                crystal x-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, differential                  thermal analysis, magnetic susceptability, photoelectron                        spectroscopy and high resolution electron microscopy will be done               with equipment presently aailable for this project at Rice                      University.  The exploratory synthesis of new classes of                        compounds with unusual oxidation states and coordination is a                   rapidly emerging area that is providing new materials or                        important \"hot technology\" areas such as magnetism and new laser                materials exhibiting sharp fluorescent lines, strong absorption                 bands, and high quantum efficiencies.",
