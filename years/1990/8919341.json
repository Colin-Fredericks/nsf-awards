 "awd_abstract_narration": "Calcium oxalate formation is pervasive in plants and can account                for the preponderance of calcium in plant organs.  Little is                    known about the physiology and biochemistry of this form of                     calcium compartmentation.  A procedure has been developed to                    isolate calcium oxalate-forming cells (crystal idioblasts) as                   protoplasts from Pistia stratiotes.  Using this system soluble                  and insoluble proteins of crystal idioblast and mesophyll                       protoplasts will be compared by gel electrophoresis to identify                 idioblast-specific proteins.  Protein components of the                         specialized crystal chamber membranes and possible existence of                 crystal matrix proteins will also be explored.  Biosynthetic                    pathways for oxalate synthesis in idioblasts and mesophyll cells                will be determined.  Calcium binding proteins will be identified                on gels and blots by standard techniques.  Characteristics of                   calcium uptake by crystal idioblast and mesophyll protoplasts                   will be determined by exposure to 45Ca (with and without                        inhibitors of calcium channels, calmodulin, and ATPases) followed               by silicone oil centrifugation.                                                                                                                                 These studies will provide valuable information, unobtainable by                other means, about mechanisms and regulation of calcium oxalate                 formation in plants and will further our understanding of the                   importance of this phenomenon to calcium metabolism of plant                    tissues.",
