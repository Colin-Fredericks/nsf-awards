Recently, a variety of micromotors                                              and a host of other small actuating                                             devices have been proposed and                                                  fabricated, using silicon and other                                             precision micromachining techniques.                                            Because these devices themselves are                                            so small, the design and development                                            of bearing and linear guides become                                             an extremely arduous task, and have                                             not been successfully demonstrated.                                             However, microbearings and                                                      microguides are an essential                                                    component of any micromachine and                                               must be developed.  It is believed                                              that due to the minuscule sizes                                                 involved, successful bearing would                                              take radically different forms from                                             those of conventional bearings in                                               the macro scales and may involve                                                innovative concepts.  The proposed                                              research involves one of such                                                   different and potentially innovative                                            designs.  It employs a resonant                                                 electric suspension to achieve open                                             loop stable levitation in all three                                             directions.  The advantages of the                                              proposed designs include complete                                               compatibility with electrostatic                                                micromotors and low power                                                       consumption requirements.  The                                                  proposed suspension can be developed                                            with available components and can be                                            successfully utilized as                                                        microbearings and microguides in                                                various designs of micromotors.",
