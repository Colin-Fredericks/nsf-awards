 "awd_abstract_narration": "The functioning of the Ac transposable element in maize is                      controlled by its own product, transposase, that acts as a                      transactivating protein resulting in a steady state condition.                  Activation of Ac is associated with the demethylation of the                    promoter region.  Structurally altered, defective Ac elements                   that differ in the demethylation of their promoter by                           transposase will be employed in a study designed to determine                   the molecular basis for the promoter demethylation.  The second                 part of this project involves an analysis of the long range cis                 interaction between elements of the Ac-Ds system.  When an Ac                   and a Ds element are coupled on the same chromosome arms, the                   distal element becomes methylated and is not digested by                        methylase-sensitive restriction enzymes.  This effect is                        limited to elements coupled on the same chromosome arm, but                     they may be as far apart as 50 map units.  Many different double                and triple combinations of Ac, Ds and other marker genes will                   be constructed to study the nature of this long range cis                       interaction.                                                                                                                                                    During a period of previous NSF support, the author of this                     proposal has discovered that one gene can influence the                         behavior of another gene on the same, chromosome over much                      greater distances than previously imagined.  He now proposes                    to pursue this discovery, and attempt to elucidate the                          mechanism by which such long-range interactions among genes                     occur.",
