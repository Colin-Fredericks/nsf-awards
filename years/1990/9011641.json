 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Papanicolaou will use probabilistic and analytic                 methods to investigate certain questions concerning the                         Schroedinger equation.  He will try to estimate the total size of               the gaps in the spectrum of a Schroedinger operator with a                      bounded and smooth potential.  He will study the dependence of                  zeroes of the Green's function on the spatial and spectral                      variables.  He has defined a complex rotation number for                        multidimensional Schroedinger operators and will now investigate                its geometric properties.  In addition he will investigate the                  short time asymptotic behavior of heat kernels and apply the                    results to inverse problems.                                                         The Schroedinger equation finds its most useful application                in nonrelativistic quantum physics but is also an area of                       intensive investigation from a pure mathematics point of view.                  In the realm of physics, this equation describes a tremendously                 wide variety of systems, from simple atoms and molecules to large               aggregates like a piece of glass or a superconductor.  The                      research described above will help in the understanding of such                 systems by providing a more thorough comprehension of the basic                 mathematics which describe these systems.",
