Recent                   studies suggest that they graze a significant portion of the                    primary production in the smaller size categories.  Some, perhaps               most, of these planktonic ciliates have feeding behaviors which                 cannot be accounted for by simple filter feeding models.  Using a               combination of scanning electron microscopy, high-speed                         videomicroscopy, and manipulation of particle characteristics,                  prey capture and selection by oligotrichs and tintinnids can be                 experimentally investigated and analyzed.  The questions to be                  addressed are:  What are the relative roles of sieving (filter                  feeding), direct interception, hydrodynamic processes, and active               scan and trap mechanisms in particle capture by the oral                        membranelles?  How do the physiochemical properties of particles                (size, density, surface charge and hydrophobicity) affect                       particle capture?  Does post-capture selection occur?  Does                     variation in particle capture mechanisms or selectivity occur                   among these ciliates?  The integrated approach, which includes                  functional morphology, hydrodynamics and biophysics,  will be                   useful in elucidating the feeding biology of marine planktonic                  ciliates.",
