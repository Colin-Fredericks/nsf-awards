 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of summer research in mechanical engineering for science and          engineering undergraduates enrolled in an REU site.  Applicants for             the program will be asked to submit transcripts, letters of                     recommendation and an essay.  Participants will be selected by a panel          of faculty members.  The program will start with an orientation                 program in which research projects and facilities are described.                Participants will be asked to select a project on which to work from a          group of twenty ongoing research programs in mechanical engineering.            A faculty supervisor will monitor the progress of each student.                 Students will be given increasing responsibilities as their skills              develop.  Students will be asked to attend biweekly seminars which              will explore current research areas, in Mechanical Engineering.  The            students will live on campus in dormitories close to one another so             that they may share their research experiences.  An informal social             program will also be organized.  At the end of the summer, students             will be asked to prepare oral and written reports on their research             activities.  We will attempt to find on-campus research jobs for                students who do well in the program.  Areas of faculty research and             expertise include heat transfer and thermodynamics, power and                   propulsion, industrial engineering, design, environmental engineering,          and Microcontamination.",
