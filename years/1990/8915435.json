 "awd_abstract_narration": "Access to remote facilities, data bases, supercomputing                       resources, and libraries and to distributed collaborators has                   become essential to research in a variety of disciplines and to                 science and engineering education at Portland State University.                 This proposal provides for this remote access by linking                        Portland State University to a midlevel network, NorthWestNet,                  with medium speed telecommunication lines (56,000 bits per                      second).  NorthWestNet is connected to the NSFNET Backbone                      Network which in turn provides high speed access (1.5 million                   bits per second) to all NSF sponsored Supercomputer Centers and                 to other Regional Network Operation Centers.                                                                                                                      The gateway/routing equipment and the communication lines will                be provided by the Western Interstate Council on Higher Education               (WICHE) through a supplemental grant to their current award for                 the management of NorthWestNet.  They will provide network                      information services and training as well as network operation                  and management services in linking Portland State to other                      universities on the midlevel backbone and to the NSFNET National                Backbone Network.  The university will provide necessary support                and technical expertise for the operation and maintenance of the                gateway node on campus as well as information services for the                  scientific users at the university.//",
