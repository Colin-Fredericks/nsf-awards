 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide renewal support for research                        that was conducted under NSF Grant No. 85-14832 results of                                                                                                      which established the surface rate corrosion constants and                                                                                                      effective diffusion coefficients for several types of                           marble when exposed to concentrated levels of sulfur                            dioxide in air.  The objective of this renewal project is                       to continue a study of the conditions under which marble                        deteriorates when subjected to sulfurous and nitrogenous                        atmospheric pollutants, both categories of which are                            produced by combustion of fossil fuels.  The investigator                       is determining the composition of crusts formed on marble                       exposed to air pollutants under laboratory conditions and                       comparing them with natural crusts obtained from locations                                                                                                      in the U.S. that are subjected to high levels of                                atmospheric pollution.                                                                                                                                          This research is likely to lead to a better understanding                       than now exists of the role played by air pollutants in                         accelerating the deterioration of materials and structures                                                                                                      that are exposed to air pollutants.  This knowledge is                          likely to be applied in engineering design for minimizing                       the effects of air pollutants on structures that are                            subjected to air pollutants from combustion processes and                       to establish the value of pollution abatement measures in                       comparison with the cost of structural deterioration from                       exposure to air pollutants.",
