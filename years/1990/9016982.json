 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have witnessed increasing applications of                     nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and dynamical systems                      theory in relativistic astrophysics and quantum field theory.                   Professor Kandrup will investigate certain general features                     underlying many of these applications and show how such                         investigations can provide significant new insights into                        specific problems.                                                                   The other area to be considered entails an application of                  ideas from statistical physics and quantum field theory in the                  early Universe.  One principal area in statistical mechanics to                 be considered is the \"relaxation\" and stability of classical                    self-gravitating systems of stars.  Relevant questions to be                    addressed include:  Why do galaxies look so similar one to                      another and \"so relaxed\" when their nominal relaxation time is                  much greater than the age of the Universe?  Can this apparent                   relaxation be derived from first principles as a consequence of                 the \"mixing\" properties of a system of self-gravitating point                   masses?  Could \"mean field fluctuations\" or other collective                    effects induce an effective relaxation on a time scale short                    compared with the \"collisional\" relaxation time?  In what sense                 are all self-gravitating systems unstable, and could this                       generic instability lead to the formation of a massive black                    hole at the center of a galaxy?                                                      Relevant questions to be addressed in field theory                         include:  To what extent can various field theoretic processes                  in the early Universe be modeled via simple stochastic                          equations?  What does one mean by \"gravitational entropy\"?  Is                  it possible to envision changes in topology in semiclassical                    quantum gravity as \"tunneling\" events, characterized as                         instantons?  Could one, e.g., make precise the idea that the                    Universe \"tunneled into Being\" as a quantum fluctuation?  What                  would this imply about the \"initial conditions\" at the Big                      Bang, and could this \"explain\" the observed \"arrow of time\"?",
