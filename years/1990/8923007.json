 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conservation of endangered species often hinges on the                 avoidance of inbreeding depression or the retention of genetic                  variation.  Therefore, it is of fundamental importance for                      conservation biology to understand and characterize inbreeding                  depression.  In the proposed research, inbreeding depression in                 Drosophila melanogaster as a model for endangered species in                    which such experimentation would not be possible.  The influence                of inbreeding on all components of fitness will be examined.  In                addition, the effect of inbreeding in the normal laboratory                     environment and two stress environments will be examined to                     obtain a more realistic view of the impact of inbreeding on                     endangered species.                                                                  In a second component of the study a computer simulation                   program will be developed to analyze pedigree populations.  Both                genetic linkage and natural selection will be incorporated.  As a               result, the effect of different rates of inbreeding on inbreeding               depression and the conditions for purging a population of lethal                alleles will be determined.  Furthermore, this technique will be                applied to known pedigrees of endangered species to determine the               expected inbreeding depression.",
