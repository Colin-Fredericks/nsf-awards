 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on modern light                   microscopy to be held in Mendoza, Argentina from November 12-                   18, 1990.  The U.S. organizer is Dr. Shinya Inoue of the                        Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts.                       His Argentinean counterpart is Dr. Mario Burgos of the                          National University of Cuyo in Mendoza.  The speakers consist                   of four experienced microscopists from each country, the U.S.                   and Argentina.  Video microscopy is a powerful tool for                         biology, medicine and materials science.  For this reason,                      this workshop assumes greater importance than just discussions                  of equipment or techniques.  The three general areas to be                      covered are:  (A) foundations of light microscopy, including                    analysis of image resolution and contrast, impact of                            illumination, and principles and applications of phase                          contrast, differential interference contrast, polarization                      microscopy, confocal imaging, and optical sectioning; (B)                       fluorescence microscopy, including target-specific probes,                      instruments, and ratio imaging; and (C) video microscopy and                    digital image processing and analysis, including video                          principles, contrast and feature enhancement, noise integra-                    tion, and examples of applications.                                                                                                                             The workshop will bring together Latin American and U.S.                        scientists to explore future collaborations.  Also they will                    share with academic and industrial investigators, including                     advanced graduate students in Latin America, the forefronts                     of this emerging field in order to encourage applications in                    research.  The mornings will generally be devoted to lectures                   and discussions, and the afternoons to laboratory demonstra-                    tions with extensive opportunities for hands-on experience                      with modern optical and video equipment.  The lecturers are                     well-experienced, having participated in similar workshops                      before at the Marine Biological Laboratory, in Woods Hole,                      Massachusetts.",
