 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantitative description of the primary nucleation kinetic                      region is vital to the state-of-the-art in hydrate research.                    Without kinetic research, the basic physics and chemistry                       cannot be used to interpret the fundamentals of hydrate                         formation.  Since the kinetics of primary nucleation from                       liquid water seems experimentally elusive and resists                           duplication in different laboratories, the starting point must                  be experiments which are reproducible - those kinetic data                      obtained for hydrate formation from ice.  This first step has                   useful analog for later extension to hydrate formation from                     liquid water.                                                                                                                                                   The impact of the proposed research represents a part of a                      turning point in the history of hydrate research from time-                     independent studies (thermodynamics) to time-dependent                          (kinetic with physical forces) studies.  The results of the                     work are too long-range to be supported by industry.  Yet the                   results have impact on such diverse problems as rates of gas                    release from hydrates for environmental problems, energy                        recovery, and the plugging of pipelines in the North Sea                        environment.",
