 "awd_abstract_narration": "Requirements for accurate and efficient processing are common                   to the transcripts of all classes of eukaryotic genes.  The                     organization and control of eukaryotic RNA processing pathways                  are the subjects of this research.  The contributions of                        selectivity, kinetics and compartmentation to TRNA processing are               being examined in this proposal.  Splicing and nuclear transport                are being studied as examples of key steps in a well-defined                    processing pathway. Our prior analyses of the properties of the                 yeast splicing complex assembly suggested both selectivity and                  compartmentation may contribute to ordering.  Using nuclear                     microinjection of Xenopus oocytes it has been previously noted                  that tRNA nuclear transport is selective, requires prior splicing               and transport, define kinetic parameters for export, and analyze                compartmentation via multifunctional enzymes and the formation of               stable complexes.  Experimental approaches include: (1)                         Expression of yeast ligase-dihydrofolate reductase fusion                       proteins in E. coli to examine structure/function relationships                 in this multifunctional protein; (2) Microinjection of pre-tRNA                 and other labeled macromolecules in Xenopus oocytes to examine                  the requirements for nuclear transport; and (3) Analysis of                     Xenopus tRNA splicing and processing both in vivo and in vitro.",
