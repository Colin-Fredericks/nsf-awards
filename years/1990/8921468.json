 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                               Organometallic Chemistry Program and the Biochemistry Program                   Dr. James A. Cowan and Dr. Richard P. Swenson will investigate                  the active site structure and mechanism of a metalloprotein                     from the bacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris which mediates the                    reduction of sulfite. This enzyme is involved in the overall                    reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide, an extremely                          important natural process, particularly in the ecology of                       wetlands. The development of a clear understanding of                           structure/function relationships for this relatively small                      multielectron redox enzyme is expected to also provide better                   insight into the operation of more complex and experimentally                   less tenable systems, such as the human respiratory enzymes.                                                                                                    A variety of physical methods, including NMR spectroscopy, will                 be used to characterize the structural environment of the                       enzyme active site, in terms of the ligands coordinating to the                 prosthetic groups and of neighboring residues that might be                     involved in catalysis. Sulfite labeled with S-35 and O-18 will                  be used to investigate the mechanism of the enzyme. Exchange                    interactions and the coordination and redox chemistry of the                    coupled siroheme-Fe4S4 complex in both the native enzyme and                    with bound exogenous ligands will be studied. A cloning program                 will be developed for the dual purpose of providing larger                      quantities of the enzyme and, by mutagenesis, to clarify the                    roles of specific residues in the function of the enzyme.",
