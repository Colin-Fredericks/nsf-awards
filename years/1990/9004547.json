 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mass extinction at the end of the Permian has been                     established as the greatest perturbation which the Earth's                      biosphere has experienced since the origin of metazoan life.                    Although relatively little is known about the cause of this mass                extinction, even less is known on biotic conditions in its                      aftermath or the nature of biotic recovery from this event.                     Fossil faunas and limestones in the Lower Triassic Virgin Member                of the Moenkopi Formation (southern Nevada and southwestern                     Utah), deposited 5 my after the end of the Permian, present an                  opportunity to learn how benthic faunas in shallow marine                       carbonate environments were faring in this recovery interval.                   Preliminary study of the Virgin limestones indicates deposition                 in a normal marine environment with benthic macroinvertebrate                   assemblages of relatively low species richness.  Of potentially                 great significance are intervals of apparent normal marine                      stromatolites, which may represent temporary expansion from                     marginal marine refugia into normal marine settings due to                      restriction of grazers, caused by the mass extinction.  Evidence                for the beginning of recovery is demonstrated through the                       presence of abundant specimens of the earliest articulate                       crinoid, which had evolved from some unknown Paleozoic inadunate                that survived the crisis.  Research will illuminate the way in                  which biotas recover from mass extinctions.",
