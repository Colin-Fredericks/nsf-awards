 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer memory is structured in layers, for example (moving from               inner to outer registers, \"main\" memory/RAM, and disk.  Each is slower          but larger than those within it.  These layers are reflected in the             design of conventional programming languages (respectively, by local            variables, non-local variable and arrays, and files), and programs are          designed to take best advantage of their relative speed, size, and              persistency.                                                                                                                                                    Functional or applicative programming languages are most promising for          parallel processing, but they do not yet deal with this layering of             memory.  Rather, present practice there is to treat all memory as RAM,          structured as a \"heap\" for linked data structures, even though this             unilevel model restricts their utility.  Furthermore, although linked           structures are very attractive for partitioning problems among                  processors, parallel heap management is an open problem.                                                                                                        This project explores methods of reconciling the necessary layering of          physical memory into the practice of purely functional programming.             One goal is to demonstrate performance of reference-counting memory             (RCM) hardware, which can manage a heap shared by many processors.              Reckoning at the memory address--remotely from any processor--it                recovers most unused memory without any processor synchronization and           little additional communication.                                                                                                                                Another goal is to implement a persistent file system within a purely           functional language.  Persistency requires that files survive certain           unpredictable failures.  Therefore, the system must retain current              state of the files, even though the concept of state is forbidden in            functional programming.",
