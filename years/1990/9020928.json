 "awd_abstract_narration": "Participation by U.S. astronomers in meetings in foreign countries              is becoming more and more important.  Over one-quarter of the                   active U.S. research astronomers are working on projects in                     collaboration with foreign scientists.  Several large foreign                   instruments which have unique capabilities are routinely used by                U.S. astronomers.  Many international scientific meetings are held              in foreign countries.  It is important for the continued health of              astronomy in the U.S. that American scientists be able to                       participate in these meetings.                                                                                                                                  The American Astronomical Society (AAS) will continue operation of              a program of support for travel to attend foreign scientific                    meetings in the field of astronomy.  Each year the AAS will select              a series of foreign meetings of scientific importance.                          Applications for travel to these meetings will be accepted, and                 awards will be made by a selection committee which will be convened             by the AAS.  The program will be publicized by the AAS at its                   meetings and through published announcements.",
