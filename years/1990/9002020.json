 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will develop and test a miniature open-cell CO2 and H20                 (MICAH) sensor that can be inserted into the leaf chamber of a                  plant gas exchange system or used in eddy-covariance measurements               of canopy photosynthesis and transpiration.  The MICAH sensor                   will be developed at the Space Dynamics Laboratory by the                       technical personnel that recently delivered similar sensors to                  NASA for use in space suits.  This design will provide low-                     maintenance, battery-powered sensors connected to open-sided                    absorption cells using infrared transmitting fiber optics.                      Innovative miniature components and microprocessor control will                 provide high-resolution performance in a hand-held, flexible                    instrument.                                                                                                                                                     This sensor is an important improvement in technology for plant                 gas exchange because it will allow accurate measurements of non-                steady-state photosynthesis.  Measurements of this type are                     necessary in the study of plant responses to sunflecks, and have                been limited by the design of current instruments.  Because the                 sensor will allow analysis of CO2 concentration in the leaf                     chamber directly, it will also allow the development of a true                  CO2 porometer, which will improve the speed, accuracy, and                      portability of field gas exchange systems.                                                                                                                      Following the successful development of this sensor, a cost-                    sharing arrangement with NSF to make copies of it available to                  scientists whose research is limited by current sensor technology               will proposed.",
