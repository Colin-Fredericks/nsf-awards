 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ROW initiation proposal is to investigate how economic                     factors, family structure, and labor market structure shape the                 employment and wage profiles of employed older Americans.  This                 research will provide information important to older adult                      economic well-being and has implications for the potential                      shortage of skilled labor during the early years of the 21st                    century.  Specific aims of the research are:                                                                                                                    1)   To identify sources of change in the age composition of                         occupations in the total labor force and sources of                             change in the gender and labor supply composition of                            occupations in the labor force aged 55 and over;                                                                                                           2)   To identify determinants of wages and labor supply in                           the older labor force as additive and interactive                               functions of individual characteristics, receipt of                             non-wage income, family structure, and trends in the                            industrial structure of the labor market;                                                                                                                  3)   To determine whether change in the industrial structure                         offsets effects of non-wage income on the labor supply                          from older employed adults;                                                                                                                                4)   To identify how family structure conditions labor                               market outcomes among older employed adults;                                                                                                               5)   To evaluate the differential effects of change in                               industrial structure on employment profiles of youth                            and older adults.
