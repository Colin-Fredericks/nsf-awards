 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferns and their spore-producing allies the lycopods and                    horsetails are unique among land plants in having two free-living               generations, both usually photosynthetic, one with half and one                 with a full complement of chromosomes.  The complete life cycle                 of a fern requires an alternation between the small haploid                     stage, at which sexual reproduction is effected, and the larger                 sporophyte or \"frond\" stage at which spores are produced, for                   dispersal by wind. Recent technical advances in the laboratory                  culturing of the small haploid generation, the gametophyte stage,               have opened the way to molecular studies of fern growth and                     development and made possible the manipulation of environmental                 cues affecting the timing of egg and sperm maturation,                          fertilization, and crossing within and among populations of fern                gametophytes.  Molecular analyses of enzymatic proteins and of                  nuclear and chloroplast DNA have also opened the way to direct                  measurement of gene differences within and among fern species. A                new set of technical tools is now available for the estimation of               phylogenetic or genealogical relationships among ferns, for the                 tracking of geographical migrations, and for measuring genetic                  impoverishment in declining populations of endangered fern                      species.                                                                             Drs. Florence Wagner and Chris Haufler have organized an                   international conference to focus on these new technical advances               in fern biology, to be hosted by the University of Michigan and                 involving scientists from 20 countries.  This will be the second                such international gathering, since the first in 1983 in                        Edinburgh.  NSF support will help bring collaborators from                      Europe, Australia, and Japan to attend the five days of meetings.               Direct discussions among researchers working in otherwise                       separate laboratories around the world will be an additional                    benefit of the conference, and will facilitate a clearer focus on               major problems in fern biology now amenable to solution.",
