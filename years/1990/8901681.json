 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neutron stars are the result of core collapse during supernova                  explosions.  They are compact objects with masses comparable to 1               to 2 suns, but with radii of about 20 km.  Their principal                      constituents are neutrons, and their interiors are believed to have             superconducting characteristics.  Furthermore, they usually possess             extreme magnetic fields (ca. 1012 times as strong as the earth's                magnetic field).  Some radiate in a pulsating fashion and are known             as pulsars.  When neutron stars accrete matter from a close                     companion star or from the interstellar medium (as many stars do),              highly energetic events ensue because of the deep gravitational                 well into which the matter falls.  The results are frequently the               emission of X- and gamma-rays, and the gradual evaporation of a                 nearby stellar companion by the irradiation with high energy                    photons.                                                                                                                                                        The Principal Investigator proposes to study theoretically six                  topics related to neutron star physics:  1. Gamma rays from                     solitary neutron stars; 2. gamma ray emission from accreting X-ray              pulsars; 3. X- and gamma-rays from low mass binaries; 4. evolution              of low mass X-ray binaries; 5.evaporation of very light companions              in close radio-pulsar binaries; and 6. flux tube expulsion from                 neutron star superconducting cores.  Dr. K. S. Cheng of Australia               has been and continues to be a collaborator.  The proposed work is              a continuation of research previously funded by NSF.",
