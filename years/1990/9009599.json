 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the implications of imperfect information                 for the functioning of the capital market, the implications of                  these derived properties of the capital markets for the behavior                of firms, the implications of these derived characteristics of firm             behavior for the macroeconomic performance of the economy, and the              potential ensuing consequences for tax policy, for macroeconomic                stabilization and growth policies, and for government interventions             in the capital markets.  A basic objective of the project is the                construction of a general macroeconomic model incorporating in a                consistent way central aspects of financial markets, together with              results derived from earlier work on how imperfect information                  affects product and labor markets.                                                                                                                              This project also enhances our understanding of the consequences                of different organizational forms for organizational performance,               in the presence of imperfect information, e.g., with respect to                 decision making (the selection of projects, the selection and                   assignment of managers), and the design of incentive structures.                                                                                                This grant is an accomplishment-based renewal.  Funding is provided             because of the high quality, pathbreaking research in the 103                   papers and 3 books completed by the investigator under his last NSF             grant and because of future contributions from this extremely                   productive project.  Research takes place in six interrelated                   areas: (1) the economics of information; (2) the implications of                imperfect information for the economy's macroeconomic performance;              (3) welfare economics; (4) the theory of innovation and market                  structure; (5) the economics of organizations; and (6) public                   finance and development.",
