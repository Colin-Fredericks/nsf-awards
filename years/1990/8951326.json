 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences              at the Florida Institute of Technology for Project LABS, which                  involves the development of a conservationist curriculum for the                biological sciences.  The LABS project will develop skills and                  analytical techniques that involve least-impact sampling, and                   emphasizes computer-assisted descriptive techniques.  Funds will                be used to purchase computer workstations and appropriate field-                sampling equipment.  The program will emphasize 1) Least-                       destructive field sampling techniques, 2) Optimized field and                   laboratory analysis; 3) Descriptive field and laboratory skills,                enhanced by the use of video- and computer-based techniques                     appropriate to modern biology; and 4) Student preparation of                    computer simulations of biotic systems.                                                                                                                         The project's goal is to train undergraduate students in skills                 that will provide additional capabilities for graduate research,                as well as skills useful in public-contact biology careers.  In                 particular, the project should encourage students to pursue careers             in taxonomy and life-history studies, to supply anticipated                     national and international needs for documentation of biodiversity.             Student participants in the program should also gain significant                appreciation of the ethics of biological conservation.  The grantee             is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
