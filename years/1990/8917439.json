 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research of Climax-type porphyry molybdenum systems during                 the past ten to fifteen years has led to identification of a                    cyclic magmatic-hydrothermal style of deposit evolution in which                a discrete molybdenum ore zone is produced by a single intrusive.               Results from numerous studies suggest there is a close temporal                 relationship between magmatism and hydrothermal mineralization,                 that metals precipitated from high temperature (500 - 600 C)                    fluids, and that both fluids and molybdenum are magmatic in                     origin.                                                                              While these studies have defined the igneous processes                     responsible for generating these deposits, they have not                        addressed the physical and chemical nature of the aqueous fluids                which exsolve from the magma and transport and precipitate the                  metals.  Existing fluid data is either preliminary in nature, or                has addressed only post-metal alteration assemblages.  Knowledge                of the physical and chemical characteristics of the aqueous                     fluids is necessary if we are to understand metal transport and                 precipitation mechanisms and to provide constraints for models                  now being formulated to quantitatively describe metal behavior in               these systems.                                                                       The Questa, New Mexico, molybdenum deposit has been                        classified as a Climax-type porphyry deposit based on petrology,                ore and alteration mineralogy, and ore grade.  However,                         preliminary fluid inclusion studies at Questa propose metals                    precipitated from lower temperature fluids (350 - 450 C) as a                   result of mixing of magmatic and meteoric fluids.  A recent,                    detailed study of alteration assemblages in a magmatic-                         hydrothermal breccia (MHBX) ore zone at Questa determined                       mineralization is similar to other Climax-type deposits in that                 it is related to high-temperature alteration assemblages.  Within               this zone, altered andesite fragments are cemented by a                         mineralized pegmatitic matrix consisting of quartz, K-feldspar,                 biotite, molybdenite, and rutile.                                                    We propose to investigate the physical and chemical                        characteristics of hydrothermal fluids in and adjacent to the                   MHBX ore zone at Questa in order to outline the temporal and                    spatial evolution of the fluid transporting and precipitating                   molybdenum mineralization.  This will be accomplished by:  1. a                 detailed microthermometric analysis to determine the gross                      chemistry of the fluids, 2. Raman microprobe analyses of fluid                  inclusions to confirm microthermometric analyses and to identify                species not uniquely defined by microthermometry, 3. detailed                   reflected-and transmitted-light petrography supplemented by                     electron microprobe studies to correlate                                        alteration/mineralization assemblages and fluid inclusion                       populations, 4. microthermometric and Raman microprobe analyses                 on samples previously characterized with respect to components                  gained and/or lost during alteration, and 5. analyses of melt                   inclusions in order to document the magmatic/hydrothermal                       transition.  Results will be combined with available fluid                      chemistry for other similar molybdenum systems in order to                      generate a model describing fluid evolution during transport and                precipitation of molybdenum mineralization.",
