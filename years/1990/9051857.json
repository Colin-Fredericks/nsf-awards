 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to introduce a laboratory component              into an introductory fluid mechanics course.  This is accomplished              by the purchase of a specially designed and fabricated modular                  fluid mechanics laboratory and exhibit.  The modular laboratory                 will consist of a series of experiments which depict various fluid              dynamic and hydrostatic principles.  In a museum exhibit fashion,               water is pumped to an overhead reservoir and sent cascading through             the various experimental stations which are interconnected by                   siphons, open channels, and weirs.  The experimental stations,                  fabricated using clear acrylic pipes and tanks, display principles              ranging from buoyancy to momentum in visually appealing settings.               Questions accompany each experimental station to promote student                interest ant to test their intuition.  While serving as a                       stimulating course introduction, the key feature of the laboratory              exhibit is the modularization. Each break-away experiment is self-              contained and easily understood, allowing for data acquisition and              analysis by students in an open-lab format during the quarter.  The             lab exercises, which can be accomplished quickly, will serve to                 verify or dispel the student's original intuitive predictions.  To              conclude the course, the individual experiments are reattached to               the exhibit.  The principles which have now been solidified in the              student's minds are once again depicted in the fascinating, museum-             like exhibit.  The institution is contributing an amount equal to               the award.***//",
