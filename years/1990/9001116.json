 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relatively little is known about the environments of central North         America during the early and middle parts of the Wisconsin glacial              period, which extended roughly from 70,000 to 25,000 years before the           present.  Few deposits of materials from the period remain; one of the          most important formations that does exist is the Roxana loess, a fine,          wind-blown material found in the upper Mississippi River valley.                Scientists have disagreed about the origins of these deposits, however,         with each alternative explanation providing markedly different                  interpretation of prevailing environmental conditions.  This doctoral           dissertation project will use geochemical, particle-size,                       mineralogical, and radiocarbon analyses to determine the source                 materials and age of Roxana loess deposits in the Mississippi River             valley between LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and Rock Island, Illinois.  The             results of these analyses will be compared with comparable analyses of          deposits from the Illinois River valley to determine whether the loess          is composed of materials from local or from glacially transported               sources, and the results will provide a firmer basis from which to              infer large- and smaller-scale paleoenvironmental conditions and                geomorphic processes during the early- and middle-Wisconsin period.                  This research will provide valuable information for scientists             conducting geomorphic and paleoenvironmental research in the upper              Midwest, and it will contribute toward reconstruction of regional               conditions during the last ice age.  The project also will provide an           excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to continue to              develop independent research skills.",
