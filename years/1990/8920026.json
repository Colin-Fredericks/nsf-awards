 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on two major questions:  (1) Do                   animal signals convey specific information about objects and                    events in the environment? (Are they representational?) and (2)                 Is the production of signals reflexive, or do animals have the                  ability to emit or withhold signals depending on the availability               of an appropriate receiver? (Is there an intent to communicate?).                                                                                               Dr. Marler's experimental approach is based on the discovery that               birds will respond to videotapes, both of stimuli that elicit                   signals, such as images of hawks, and of other birds, as an                     acceptable audience for signal production.  Domestic chickens                   have a large repertoire of vocal signals, including different                   calls associated with the discovery of food and with sighting a                 predator such as a hawk.  Dr. Marler will manipulate the form of                video images to explore what characteristics a bird image must                  possess to qualify as an acceptable audience (size, color, parts                of the body, behavior), and to determine the relative                           contributions of visual and auditory audience properties.  Other                experiments will pursue indications that the optimal audience may               vary depending on the kind of information that signals convey                   (aerial predators versus ground predators, optimal or sub-optimal               food items, etc.).                                                                                                                                              These studies will throw new light on what the communicative                    signals of animals actually mean, and the extent to which they                  share some of the important characteristics of human language.",
