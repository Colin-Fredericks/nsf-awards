 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many planktonic animals use setulose appendages to capture food                 or molecules, and to swim or propel water.  Continued                           investigations into the physical mechanisms by which such                       appendages move water and separate particles from it will                       provide understanding of ecological and evolutionary meaning of                 shape and mechanical function of the appendages.  The food-                     capturing second maxillae (M2's) of calanoid copepods are of                    primary importance because of the ecological importance of                      copepod feeding, and because of the diversity of morphologies                   and behaviors of M2's operatiang at a range of velocities where                 transitions in function are expected to occur.  Dynamically-                    scaled physical models, based on data gathered from SEM and                     high-speed microcinematography of a variety of copepods, will                   be used: 1) to test predictions of mathematical models of the                   hydrodynamics of these appendages, and 2) to investigate the                    performance consequences of morphological features and                          behaviors too complicated to address mathematically.  The                       investigation will show how defined aspects of body shape,                      appendage morphology, flapping kinematics, and motions of                       neighboring appendages affect the leakiness, capture range,                     particle-selectivity, drag, and power requirements of second                    maxillae.",
