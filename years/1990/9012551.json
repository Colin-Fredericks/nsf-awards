 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive control theory lacks a conceptual framework                            which is sufficiently simple to help qualified                                  nonspecialists to understand the current theory without                         making an inordinately large time investment and which                          might also serve as the basis for further development.                          We propose to continue our recently initiated research                          program aimed at constructing such a framework.                                 Existing adaptive algorithms for which 'global' stability                       can be proved without requiring sufficient excitation are                       either applicable to process models satisfying assumptions                      which recent results show are unnecessary restrictive or                        perform inefficiently and consequently are of limited                           practical value.  The underlying reason for this is that to                     be applicable to \"large\" classes of process models, the                         parameter design models upon which certainty                                    equivalence control is based, almost always have points in                      their parameter spaces at which the design model is not                         stabilizable--and at such points, certainty equivalence                         control is impossible.  We propose to deal with this                            problem in two fundamentally different ways.  First, we                         propose to develop and utilize new parameterized design                         models which are stabilizable on their parameterized                            spaces and, in addition, are applicable to \"large\" classes                      of process models.  Second, as an alternative approach                          we propose to exploit the concept of \"implicit tuning\"                          which does not require a design model to be stabilizable                        at every point in its parameter space.  In both cases we                        shall rely heavily on computer simulation to rule out                           unacceptable algorithms and to guide us in the                                  development of acceptable ones.",
