 "awd_abstract_narration": "New developments in science and technology have led to rapidly                  changing management systems for agricultural animals.  These new                practices result in lowered production costs and cheaper food;                  they also raise ethical questions of public concern.  This new                  social context has spawned new science and technology for animal                welfare.  This award provides partial support for travel costs                  for speakers and organizing committee members for \"An                           International Conference on Farm Animal Welfare:  Ethical,                      Scientific and Technological Perspectives\" in Spring, 1991.  The                conference will address the ethical considerations involved in                  animal-based food production and the potential impact of                        scientific and technological changes on the human-farm animal                   interface.  Sponsors and participants represent a variety of                    viewpoints and disciplines including research, education, ethics,               animal welfare organizations, government agencies and animal                    industries.  Five symposia are planned:  Ethical and                            Technological Issues associated with Animal Agriculture;                        Assessing Animal Well-Being; New Technologies to Improve the                    Welfare of Production Animals:  Sustainable and Alternative                     Production Systems for Animal Agriculture; Current Regulations,                 Guidelines and Codes of Practice Affecting Farm Animals Used in                 Production and Research; and Workshop on Future Directions.                     Output from the conference will include numerous special                        publications and several volumes of proceedings.                                                                                                                This project addresses an important issue; it brings together                   leaders from science, industry, animal welfare and public                       interest organizations in this nation and abroad to listen to                   state-of-the-art presentations and discuss future research                      directions, undergraduate and graduate educational activities and               public educational activities.  The project team, advisors, and                 speakers represent an appropriate mix of expertise and views and                are uniquely qualified to collaborate in this project.  Results                 are likely to forward professional and public discussion of the                 issues.  The project is designed well; significant support is                   forthcoming from other organizations and from the university                    sponsor.  An award in the amount of $25,000 is recommended.",
