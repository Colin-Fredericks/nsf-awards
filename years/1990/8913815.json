 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) of                Michigan State University is a national users facility                          for fundamental research in nuclear science.  This                              cooperative agreement provides funds for operation of the NSCL,                 for support of its users program and for support of the research                of the MSU staff in nuclear science and in accelerator and                      instrumentation physics.  Facilities at the Laboratory include                  two compact superconducting cyclotrons of NSCL design and                       construction. The K500 cyclotron, the world's first                             superconducting cyclotron, began operation in 1982, and the K1200               cyclotron, the world's largest superconducting cyclotron, was                   commissioned in June 1988.  A flexible array of detection                       equipment will be complete for use during the proposal period.                  The NSCL will then be an exceptionally powerful international                   facility for research on nucleus-nucleus collisions.  High                      quality beams will be available over the whole range of                         projectile mass, from hydrogen to uranium, for studies of nuclear               phenomena in the transition region where the projectile velocity                crosses the velocity of nuclear sound, and nuclear shock waves                  compress the nuclear material.  These beams will also make                      possible unique studies of the structure of nuclei.                                  The cyclotrons provide an array of heavy ions unique in the                U.S. and, together with the associated instrumentation, support                 an extensive national users program in heavy ion physics.                            The MSU research activity supported under this cooperative                 agreement includes an active accelerator physics research                       program.  Instrumentation development, particularly involving                   superconducting technology, is another major activity.                               Graduate student training is a prominent aspect of the NSCL                activity.  Approximately 30 graduate students in residence are                  supported by this cooperative agreement.",
