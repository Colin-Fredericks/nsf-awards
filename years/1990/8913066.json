 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will undertake a small experimental effort to test some of           the physical basis for the principles of an inverse free-electron               laser accelerator (IFELA).  The principle of the IFELA is to use an             intense laser beam to accelerate a group of electrons.  The Columbia            free-electron laser will be configured as an IFELA, in which its                intense laser wave is used to trap and bunch electrons that in the              presence of a suitable undulator may be accelerated to higher energy.           This study will be a proof of principle experiment using a two-section          undulator:  the first section causes laser oscillation at high power            level while the second is for the acceleration.  The FEL is configured          as an autoaccelerator which increases the energy of one group of                electrons at the expense of the remaining group.  The laser oscillates          at a wavelength of 2mm and the electron beam energy is 800kV; the               accelerated particles will have an energy of approximately lMV, well            resolved from the unaccelerated group.  Diagnostics include an array            of power and spectral instruments, which are used to understand the             stimulated absorption of the laser, together with a new electron                momentum analyser which will be constructed at Columbia.  Theoretical           studies include one and two dimensional numerical simulations, as well          as a continuing examination of how the use of a background plasma may           be used to improve the acceleration.",
