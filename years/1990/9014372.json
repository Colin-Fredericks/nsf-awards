 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is directed toward testing the hypothesis of the                  origin of eukaryotic cell organelles by microbial symbioses.                    Intracellular microtubule systems are purported to derive from                  symbiotic associations of fermenting and motile bacteria.  In                   particlular, the idea that centrioles and axonemes as well as                   cilia, eukaryotic \"flagella\", the mitotic spindle, and other                    eukaryotic microtubular systems are derived from spirochete                     motility symbioses.  This proposal suggests development of two                  lines of evidence in approaching this problem:  cloning the gene                for a tubulin-like protein which this laboratory recently has                   detected in Spirochaeta bajacaliforniensis, and seeking proteins                in spirochetes similar to axonemal proteins using immunological                 techniques,  To facilitate these studies methods will be                        developed to culture large, free-living spirochetes.                                                                                                            Some two decades ago Dr. Margulis proposed a major hypothesis for               the origin of eukaryotic cells.  She suggested that cells evolved               by a sequence of steps in which close symbiotic relationships                   were formed between microorganisms.  In effect, one type of                     microorganism took up residence inside another (became an                       \"endosymbiont\") and ultimately became a cellular \"organelle\".                   Her ideas concerning the origin of plastids, and mitochondria as                microbial endosymbionts have been substantiated by molecular                    studies in a number of laboratories.  Her idea that major                       cellular organelles responsible for motility arose from symbiotic               relationships between microbes like present day spirochetes has,                as yet, not been tested.  The work proposed here would enable Dr.               Margulis to begin a systematic comparison between spirochete                    proteins and proteins comprising the organelles responsible for                 motility in present day eukaryotic cells.  The results will lead                to a critical test of a major postulate of this important general               hypothesis concerning the origin of cellular organelles.",
