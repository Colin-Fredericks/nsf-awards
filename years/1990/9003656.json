It is a                                              continuation of the work that was funded                                        through the Small Grant for Exploratory                                         Research (SGER) program: the objective of                                       that award was to collect perishable data on                                    the liquefaction sand boils and the                                             superficial ground displacements in the                                         Marina District of San Francisco resulting                                      from the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                                                                                                                The objectives of this continuation research                                    project are: to supplement the data collected                                   with existing data on the Marina District; to                                   complement the field observations with in-                                      situ and laboratory tests; to compile and                                       document a complete data set for case study                                     analysis of liquefaction and site                                               amplification; to evaluate, using this data                                     set, the one-dimensional methods of site                                        amplification and liquefaction; and to                                          develop a nonlinear finite element model to                                     analyze the site amplification and                                              liquefaction of the Marina District during                                      the Loma Prieta earthquake.                                                                                                                                     The resulting improved understanding of the                                     present methods of liquefaction analysis will                                   have application to other areas at risk from                                    earthquake-induced liquefaction, such as the                                    Los Angeles coast, whose geological                                             conditions possess relevant similarities to                                     those of the Marina District.",
