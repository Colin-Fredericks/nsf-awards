The variability in the acoustic pattern of words has many               different sources, including intra- and inter-speaker differences               in speaking style and rate, various contextual effects, and                     anatomic differences between speakers.  Thus, whereas linguistic                descriptions use binary-valued features, the acoustic correlates                of the feature have varying degrees of strength and extent over                 time.                                                                                The research will be divided into three stages.  To ensure                 an adequate representation of the variability that can occur, a                 database of around 200 words will be designed.  The test words                  will be excised from a variety of contexts and spoken by several                talkers, both males and females.  Next, an acoustic study of the                corpus will be conducted to supplement data in the literature on                the acoustic correlates for features and to further study                       variability.  Finally, a speaker-independent isolated word                      recognition system will be developed and tested with a new                      database of the same 200 words.                                                      The recognition system will consist of three components:                   property detectors for extracting the acoustic properties for                   features, a lexicon which will consist of some arrangement of                   features for each word, and a matcher for mapping between the                   extracted acoustic patterns and the lexical representation.                     There will be several ways to handle variability.  First, the                   acoustic properties for features will be based on relative                      measures so that they will be minimally dependent upon the                      speaker's characteristics.  Second, unlike traditional feature-                 based recognition systems, lexical access will be achieved                      directly from the acoustic properties rather than from postulated               phonetic segments.  In this way, contextual information can be                  taken into account more directly during the matching process.                   Finally, the investigator will develop a framework for expressing               variability within the lexical representation of words.  Although               variability has several sources, it appears that the resulting                  acoustic changes can be expressed in terms of a few feature-                    altering processes including phonetic lenition, feature                         assimilation and some other structurally-dependent variants.                    Thus by incorporating the feature-altering processes in the                     lexical representation of words, it should not be necessary for                 the recognition system to have \"seen\" or have a rule for all of                 the variability that can occur in a particular word before it is                able to recognize it.                                                                The results of this project should contribute to our                       understanding of acoustic phonetics, and also to the development                of improved technologies for automatic speech recognition.",
