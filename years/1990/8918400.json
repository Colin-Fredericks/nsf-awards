 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major anatomical differences between humans and                 apes is in the construction of the pelvis (hipbones) which                      permits humans to walk with habitually upright posture, whereas                 apes cannot.  Although these bones are well known from living                   humans and living apes, fossil fragments of this important part                 of the skeleton are infrequently found and complete fossil pelvic               bones are exceedingly rare.  Recently a nearly complete hipbone                 of the Miocene ape, Proconsul, was discovered in East Africa                    together with fragments of additional hipbones.  The purpose of                 this research is to describe, analyze, and interpret the                        functional morphology of these bones.  They will be compared with               bones from a large sample of living and extinct anthropoid                      primates in order to interpret their locomotor and positional                   repertoire.  Some investigators have suggested that Proconsul                   represents a mixture of hominoid, cercopithecoid and unique                     features.  This analysis will help resolve this question about                  the exact phylogenetic position of Proconsul, a topic currently                 under considerable debate.",
