The                  program is targeted at minority students, faculty, and                          professionals with interest in aquatic sciences, as well as                     majority faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and                  Universities (HMCUs).                                                                The proposed activities include: an initial free                           membership in ASLO and support to attend annual meetings;                       pre.meeting workshops to prepare attendees for active                           participation in the meeting; and a special session during the                  meeting for HMCU representatives to make presentations.                              The combined efforts of an HMCU and a professional                         society should provide an effective mechanism to attract                        minority students and get them actively interested and involved                 in scientific research and professional society activities.",
