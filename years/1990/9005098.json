 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants are a major source of fine chemicals (secondary                          metabolites) including pharmaceuticals, fragrances, flavors, and                pesticides.  Although there has been but limited success in the                 profitable production of secondary products from plant cultures                 there is serious interest in the use of plant cell and tissue                   culture for the production of these valuable commodities.  Many                 of these products are produced by roots, so the use of plants                   transformed by Agrobacterium, yielding hairy roots, offers great                potential for comercial exploitation.  Hairy roots are                          genetically stable, grow rapidly, and produce levels of secondary               products equal to or greater than the whole plant.  Root hairs,                 however, are easily damaged in conventional bioreactors.  A                     further barrier to the use of these plant tissues on a commercial               scale is that most secondary metabolites accumulate within the                  plant tissue and are not readily exported into the growth medium.               Thus, there is a need for nondestructive methods for culturing                  hairy roots and methods by which the products produced by these                 plant tissues can be recovered for processing while still                       retaining the biomass.  The goals of the proposed research are to               grow hairy roots of beets (Beta vulgaris) in a new bioreactor                   which employs nutrient mists, and to test physical techniques for               the reversible permeabilization of cells for release of products                into the medium.                                                                                                                                                The proposed research will lay the groundwork for development of                a unique model system for the large scale growth of plant hairy                 roots and development of techniques for the recovery of                         commercially valuable products (secondary metabolites) from these               specialized plant tissues.",
