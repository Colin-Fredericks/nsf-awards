 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voice/data integrated multiplexers employed in multimedia                  environments and random access networks using the Carrier Sensing               Multiple Access protocols continue to be widely used in modern                  communications.  Therefore, it is important that they be                        understood as completely as possible.  One of the most important                problems is to study their time dependent, or transient                         performance.                                                                         This project's objectives are:  1) to obtain a theoretical                 and computational framework to evaluate the transient behavior of               stochastic models for these networks, whose parameters may also                 be stationary or time dependent.  2) To evaluate the transient                  performance of voice/data integrated networks and multiaccess                   networks, which cannot be found using steady state analysis.                    Models to be analyzed are the voice/data integrated switches with               movable boundary assignments, network models with more realistic                descriptions of packet length arrival processes, multi-packet or                multi-active-user arrivals, and the network stability analysis.                 3)  The design of some dynamic routing and control schemes in                   voice/data switches based on their time/dependent behaviors.  4)                To generalize the approach to the study of more fundamental                     queueing problems.",
