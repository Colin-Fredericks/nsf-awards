 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of a multi-nuclei, variable temperature Fourier                 transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer has been                      essential for the joined Departments of Chemistry at the                        institution and the College of Mount St. Vincent.  The instrument               bridges the gap between undergraduate training and graduate                     research and inaugurated a new era in the teaching of chemistry                 to the students.  Emphasis on (13)C-NMR, using COSY, HETCOR and                 2D pulse techniques is an integral part of modern NMR                           spectroscopy.  FT-NMR enables students to use smaller amounts of                chemicals, complementing semimicroscale procedures previously                   adopted in the organic laboratory.  Skills such as recording and                interpreting spectral data are complemented by the concepts                     learned in advanced physical, analytical and instrumental                       chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      Research is an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum; a                 high field FT-NMR is essential for modern research in chemistry.                The acquisition of such an instrument is supporting the recently                instituted program in nuclear medicine technology.                                                                                                              The institution is contributing to the project in an amount in                  excess of $7,000 over the NSF funds.",
