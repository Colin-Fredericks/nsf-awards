This                        conference is primarily concerned with the biology and molecular                biology of genetic exchange systems in a variety of procaryotic                 and eucaryotic systems, and is the major annually occurring                     meeting devoted to this subject area internationally.  One                      significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to                 graduate students and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds                frequently are limited.  Specifically to address this problem,                  funds are provided to support travel and scholarships to                        facilitate the attendance of graduate students and post-doctoral                students working in various areas of genetic exchange and                       related subject areas.",
