 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to understand the                        functional organization and structural dynamics of the RecA and                 RecBCD enzymes in order to determine how their many activities                  are coordinated in carrying out the overall process of genetic                  recombination.  The regions of these enzymes that are involved in               particular functions, e.g. DNA binding, ATP binding and                         hydrolysis, and oligomeric contacts will be identified.  Once                   regions of the proteins have been identified as critical for a                  given function, a variety of mutagenic techniques will be used,                 combined with appropriate genetic selections and screens, to                    detail the structural requirements for that function.  Resulting                mutant proteins will also be analyzed for their ability to                      undergo ligand-induced conformational changes, a feature of many                multifunctional enzymes which underlies their ability to                        coordinate various catalytic activities.  Further genetic                       analysis of the relationship between protein structure and                      function will be performed by using a number of the recombination               deficient mutant proteins obtained in this study to select                      androgenic second site revertants. The analyses of RecA and                     RecBCD will serve to provide both a more detailed molecular                     description of genetic recombination, as well as further insights               into the mechanisms by which multifunctional, oligomeric enzymes                organize a variety of activities into an ordered enzymatic                      process.",
