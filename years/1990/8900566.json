 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work on the simultaneous purification and                              concentration of biomolecules by displacement chromatography                    is expanded to include:  separations of complex mixtures of                     biomolecules, development of novel displacer compounds and an                   investigation of affinity displacement chromatography.                          Adsorption data obtained from frontal microscale                                chromatography is used to select appropriate displacers and                     chromatographic conditions for the displacement experiments.                    Displacement experiments are carried out with analytical and                    preparative columns packed with a variety of stationary phase                   materials.  New classes of displacer compounds are identified                   and synthesized for various chromatographic systems.  This                      research significantly increases the arsenal of available                       displacer compounds and provides basic guidelines for the                       selection of appropriate displacers for future bioseparation                    problems.  Group-specific affinity chromatographic materials                    such as immobilized reactive dyes, lectins, and metal chelate                   systems are investigated for their potential use in the                         displacement mode.  The use of affinity supports in the                         displacement mode is expected to significantly increase the                     throughput and purity attained with these selective                             chromatographic systems.  This research will significantly                      expand the scope of displacement chromatography and will                        facilitate the widespread use of the technique for the                          purification of biopharmaceuticals.",
