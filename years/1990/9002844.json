 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalytically stabilized thermal (CST) incineration of                          chlorinated hydrocarbons uses catalytic surface reactions to                    stabilize gas phase reactions.  Hot wall effects and surface-                   generated reactive intermediates are hypothesized to improve                    stabilization of gas phase chlorinated hydrocarbon combustion,                  enabling rapid plug flow (low residence time and small                          combustor size) incineration with high destruction of toxic                     organic species, and stable combustion of even very low BTU                     mixtures.  Work to date has shown that a CST incinerator can                    stabilize methyl chloride and methylene chloride combustion                     sufficiently to enable high throughput plug flow operation,                     achieving 99.999% + destruction levels with a residence time                    of 15 ms.                                                                                                                                                       In Phase I, reaction mechanisms for methyl chloride                             destruction in plug flow thermally stabilized and                               catalytically stabilized reactors were investigated, through                    preliminary model development and through experimental flow                     tube kinetic studies.  This work identified preliminary                         parameters and provided a initial basis for further                             experimental studies and development of a catalytic plug flow                   reactor model in Phase II, for use in Phase III prototype                       development and system design.  First approximation plug flow                   thermal reactor model results predicted high destruction                        levels at moderately high temperature, and this was confirmed                   experimentally in a non-catalytic isothermal reactor.                           Catalytic isothermal reactor experiments altered the gas phase                  reaction mechanisms and significantly lowered required                          temperature and residence time for high destruction.  The                       experimental findings advance fundamental understanding of the                  underlying mechanisms affecting chlorinated hydrocarbon                         combustion and emissions.  Ultra-high destruction                               effectiveness, increased safety, small incinerator size and                     reduced costs will make this technology attractive to the                       large and growing thermal incineration market.",
