 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of cyanobacteria have been shown to respond to                         conditions of macronutrient deprivation (phosphorus, sulfur and                 nitrogen) by degrading the light harvesting phycobilisome                       complex, eliminating most of the photosynthetic membranes and                   synthesizing proteins involved in nutrient acquisition and                      assimilation.  If nutrients are withheld for long periods of time               the organism can maintain viability by entering a quiescent or                  dormant phase.  A detailed molecular examination of the responses               of the unicellular cyanobacterium Anacystis nidulans, strain R2,                to sulfur deprivation has been initiated.  Many genes that are                  activated when sulfur is eliminated from the growth medium have                 been isolated and at least partially sequenced.  Some of these                  genes encode proteins involved in sulfate uptake (polypeptides of               the four components sulfate transport system) while others may be               important for growth on sulfur-containing compounds such as                     thiosulfate or glutathione.  To help elucidate biochemical or                   genetic changes that accompany the acclimation of Anacystis to                  sulfur stress, proteins that accumulate and genes that are                      activated when sulfur is eliminated from the growth medium are                  being characterized.  Molecules involved in sensing the sulfur                  status of the environment and elements required for gene                        regulation will be established.                                                                                                                                 Most organisms have the capacity to modulate specific                           physiological processes to accomodate changes in their                          environment.  This research addresses the manner in which                       external information is perceived by cells and the events                       involved in eliciting alterations in the physiological state                    through changes in gene expression.  Attention will be focused on               the response of a cyanobacterium to sulfur deprivation.  The                    results of this work will provide an increased understanding of                 the structural and functional components required by the cells to               withstand nutrient limiting conditions, the interrelationship                   between photosynthetic carbon fixation and the sulfur status of                 the cell, and the mechanism by which photosynthetic organisms                   sense and respond to their environment.",
