 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric N. Jacobsen is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                   Program as a Presidential Young Investigator.  He will be                       studying the development of enantioselective catalysts for                      organic synthesis.  The oxidation of unfunctionalized olefins                   will be the first reaction that he will explore.                                                                                                                Facial selectivity in group transfer to a prochiral olefin can                  be controlled by purely non-bonded interactions or by                           constraining the degrees of freedom in diastereometric                          transition states through substrate pre-coordination.                           Catalytic systems are being developed based on both principles.                 A series of chiral manganese complexes have been designed which                 catalyze epoxidation of isolated and unfunctionalized olefins                   by iodosoarenes with up to 33% enantiomeric excess.  The                        ligands for these complexes are readily prepared by                             condensation of chiral diamines with salicylaldehyde                            drivatives, permitting systematic variation of their steric and                 electronic properties.  Current efforts are directed toward                     tuning the steric environment surrounding the reactive site in                  order to increase enantioselectivity to synthetically useful                    levels and to use observed stereochemical preferences to map                    out the trajectory of olefin approach to the intermediate metal                 oxo species.  The results with six catalysts prepared to date                   and examination of a crystal structure of the most effective                    system have allowed a detailed transition structure for                         oxygen-atom-transfer from manganese to olefin to be developed.                  This model is now being refined by systematic variation of                      metal, ligand, and substrate; the elucidation of a transition                   structure which holds predictive value with regard to                           stereochemistry will also provide mechanistic insight into the                  general question of oxygen-atom transfer from metals to                         olefins, an important step in a wide range of laboratory,                       industrial, and biological processes.",
