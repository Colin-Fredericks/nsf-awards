 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drying processes are used in almost all major industries from              agriculture to plastics, yet are only 40-45% efficient. An advanced             model for a drying system, presented in a user-friendly software                format, could aid in both overall system efficiency and in the                  design and maintenance of the drier drums in the case of the pulp               and paper industry. Although much work is available discussing heat             and mass transfer through porous media, very few models have been               developed for fibrous media and water removal systems. In general,              existing models either incorporate too many assumptions or else                 fail to correlate with experimental data.                                       %%%                                                                                  The intent of this research is to develop a suitable model                 which, once reduced by acceptable assumptions and approximations,               can be solved numerically. A software package will then be                      developed to simulate entire drying systems.",
