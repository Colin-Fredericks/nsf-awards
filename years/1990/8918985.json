Mohamed A. El-                       Sayed and Ahmed El-Toukhy of the University of Alexandria,                      Alexandria Egypt.  These research groups have discovered and                    developed a new field of polymetallic transmetalation                           chemistry.  Transmetalation is the replacement of metallic                      elements in a target material with other metallic elements                      received from chemical reagents.  Research to date has been                     substantial resulting in nine published research papers with                    eight additional papers submitted for publication or in the                     advanced stage of preparation.  This original research has                      revealed six new areas of importance that are considered                        worthy of further research and exploration.  The new                            research is expected to have a large impact on chemical,                        materials and catalytic science.  Further, it will provide                      numerous learning opportunities for students in modern                          inorganic and physical chemistry.                                                                                                                               Scope:  The proposed research is programmed for two years                       with the principal investigators working in their                               counterpart's laboratories.  The two Egyptian scientists                        will spend a total of 12 months at Northeastern University.                     Dr. Davies will work at Alexandria University for three                         months.  This work division will advantage both researh                         groups in exposing one and another to the research                              facilities of each university, while giving the graduate                        students of each chemistry department opportunities to                          become acquainted with the scientific thinking, techniques                      and problem solving approaches employed by successful                           scientists from the cooperating foreign university.                                                                                                             The six areas of proposed new research are:                                                                                                                             o       Crystallization and Electrochemical Studies                             o       Mechanisms of Phenolic Oxidative Coupling                               o       Catalytic Effects of Transmetalation                                    o       Transmetalation Rate Laws and Mechanisms                                o       Low Temperature Dimeric Copper(I)-Dioxygen Systems                      o       Oxidation of Polynuclear Copper(I)-Dioxygen                                    Complexes with Quinones                                                                                                                          This proposal meets the objectives of the Science in                            Developing Countries Program of advancing the international                     exchange of scientific knowledge and does contribute to the                     enhancement of science in a developing country.",
