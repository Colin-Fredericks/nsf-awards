Approximately 20 faculty members in the departments                     of biology, chemistry, mathematics, physics, and psychology                     will participate in this project.  The theme of the program                     is LIGHT AND VISION and will consist of classroom activities                    including lectures/discussions and laboratories, research                       projects, and field trips.  Participants will explore career                    options in the sciences and will work to achieve                                understanding of ethical considerations scientists face.                        Follow-up activities will include student presentations based                   on their Young Scholars workshop experience to students and                     teachers in their home schools.  Each participant will also                     conduct a short-term experiment at their home school in the                     Fall under the guidance of a St. Olaf faculty person and                        their 9th grade science teacher.",
