 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work                  of Dr. Christopher J. Abelt at the College of William and Mary,                 who is studying the light-induced transfer of electrons between                 molecules that are held in constrained orientations.  This                      investigation will provide fundamental information on the                       mechanism of electron transfer between reacting species.                                                                                                        The experiments to be conducted by Dr. Abelt will employ                        chemically modified cyclodextrins having cyanoanthracene                        substituents that can initiate photoinduced electron-transfer                   reactions.  Treatment of these derivatives with aromatic amines                 will result in binding of the latter within the molecular                       cavity of the cyclodextrin, and irradiation of the resulting                    host-guest complexes will initiate the electron transfer                        process.  The studies will define the relationship of                           charge-transfer interaction with binding of the aromatic amines                 and will allow Dr. Abelt to determine the effectiveness of                      differently substituted cyclodextrins in carrying out                           photoinduced electron-transfer reactions of bound guests.",
