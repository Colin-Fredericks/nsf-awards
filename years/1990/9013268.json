 "awd_abstract_narration": "The H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest is a 16,000 acre (6400                    hectare) U.S. Forest Service property in the western Oregon                     Cascades dedicated to research and education.  It is jointly                    administered by Oregon State University (OSU) and the U.S. Forest               Service Pacific Northwest Research Station (PNW).  Research use                 of the Andrews Forest and nearby Research Natural Areas is heavy,               with more than 7000 researcher-days of use and over 100 separate                projects in each of the last 5 years.  Current overnight capacity               is inadequate, however, and threatens to get worse as old, worn                 out trailers reach the point of condemnation.  Since 1985,                      capacity has declined from 54 to 40 and will decrease to 28 in                  the next two years unless new space is created.  Quite simply the               research site is facing a housing crisis.  This project will help               construct two quadruplex dormitories.  OSU has pledged $56,000                  and PNW $137,000 for a total of $193,000, a 50/50 match.  The two               quads would increase overnight capacity bedrooms, two bathrooms                 with showers and a kitchen-living area.  Bedrooms (about 100 sq.                ft. each) will contain a bed, desk, bookcase, and wardrobe.  The                quads will be plain but solid with 6 inch studding, exteriors of                T-1-11 siding, drywall panelling, and plywood cabinetwork.  They                will also be well insulated with R-19 walls and floors, R-32                    ceilings, and double-glazed windows.",
