Essentially all groups of mollusks                  from around the world are represented in this collection, and                   thorough systematic research in malacology almost always requires               reference to specimens in this collection.  The collection                      includes more than 400,000 specimen lots, comprising 10.3 million               specimens, of which 11,700 are type specimens.  Three major                     curatorial projects are currently underway: computer cataloging                 and accessioning of shells obtained as gifts, orphaned                          collections, and research collections; sorting, identifying,                    cataloging and accessioning alcohol-preserved specimens; and                    completion of a computerized catalog of type specimens.                              These curatorial projects will improve greatly the research                impact of the collection.  Visiting scientists will have more                   complete access to important material, and malacologists from                   around the world will gain a clearer picture of the Academy's                   holdings.  Research in systematics, evolutionary biology,                       ecology, and environmental management will be enhanced through                  these efforts.",
