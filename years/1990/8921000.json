 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of one initiated under NSF Grant                      No. 87-01184 to develop methods for recovery of the                             historical input record of pollutants from analysis of                          sedimentary deposits obtained by coring lake sediments. In                      this prior work, a frequency domain deconvolution method                        was developed to extract past input fluxes of these types                       of pollutants from their sedimentary record.  Pollutants                        of interest include lead, zinc, cadmium, polychlorinated                        biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  This                           renewal will permit enhancement of the experimental                             methods developed previously for analysis of polycyclic                         aromatic hydrocarbons and for the gamma-emitting                                radioactive tracer Cesium-137.                                                                                                                                  Sedimentary deposits of particle-associated pollutants can                      provide valuable information for use in devising                                environmental models and in their validation.  However,                         these records are often distorted reflections of past                           fluxes because of the variety of physical, chemical and                         biological environmental processes to which the particles                       are subjected during and following their deposition.                            These processes include mixing, biodegradation,                                 radioactive decay and compaction.  This project has the                         potential for obtaining more information than is now                            possible from an analysis of sedimentary deposits.  This                        in turn may prove useful in validating models of climate                        and hydrological processes as they relate to pollutant                          deposition in coast regions of the United States.",
