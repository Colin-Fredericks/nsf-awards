 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the macroeconomic                    consequences of credit market imperfections and examine the                     channels through which monetary policy affects real economic                    activity.  In previous research, the authors have identified                    episodes when the Federal Reserve undertook major shifts in                     monetary policy out of a desire to reduce inflation.  Because                   these policy changes were essentially independent of real                       economic developments, they can be used to disentangle the                      effects of monetary policy, and the mechanisms through which                    those effects occur, from the effects of real economic                          developments on financial variables.  In particular, the                        information provided by these episodes will be used to test                     between theories in which the impact of monetary policy on the                  money stock is central to the transmission mechanism and theories               in which it is the impact on lending by financial intermediaries                that are central.  This research is important because it will                   provide a better understanding of the role that credit market                   imperfections may play in causing or contributing to                            macroeconomic fluctuations.",
