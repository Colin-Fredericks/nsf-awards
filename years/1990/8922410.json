 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important trend in thermoplastics is the growth of products                  based on polymer-polymer blends.  They are called \"engineered\"                  thermoplastics because they have high enough modulus,                           toughness and softening temperature to be used the same way                     metals are used. Most of these blends are immiscible but                        stabilized in a highly dispersed morphology by graft or block                   copolymers at the interface between the phases.  One way to                     make these copolymers is by coupling reactions during melt                      blending.                                                                                                                                                       This research will focus on blends of two immiscible polymers,                  one rigid (glass transition temperature greater than ambient                    temperature) the other soft (glass transition temperature less                  than ambient temperature).  Initially both phases will be                       amorphous.  The strategy will be to design several model                        reactive polymer pairs and combine them in a small laboratory                   melt mixer which duplicates the essential features of the                       industrial scale process.  The PIs plan to identify the major                   variables controlling the process by changes in composition,                    chemistry, polymer architecture and chain length.  Scanning                     and transmission electron microscopy will be used as the major                  microstructural characterization method.  From image analysis                   on these micrographs and single drop studies, the drop break                    up and coalescence process with interfacial reaction will be                    modeled.  This research should yield better methods for the                     analysis of these polymer blends as well as a fundamental                       understanding of the process and new blend compatibilizing                      methods and materials.",
