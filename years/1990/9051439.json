 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analog Circuits Laboratory Project aims at major curricular                 revisions in the Electronic Engineering Technology program.                     Specifically, the analog circuits sequence is changed from an emphasis          on circuits as closed systems to signal processing building blocks used         to implement larger systems.  This change results in an increase in             systems-level and frequency-domain analyses.  Computer-based tools and          circuit simulation techniques are integrated into existing courses.             The Tektronix 2630 Personal Fourier Analyzer and system controller are          the major instruments purchased and are accompanied by Microsim PSPICE          Circuit Simulation software.  The students maximize their performance           through computer-based analysis and simulation tools.  Following the            design, the circuits and subsystems are built and tested for                    verification of performance in both the time and frequency domains.             The project responds to the shift in engineering practices in industry          and targets curricular revisions which parallel the changes in the work         place.                                                                          The award is being matched with a greater amount, 104%, by the                  principal investigator's institution.",
