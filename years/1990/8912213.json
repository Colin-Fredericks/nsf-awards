Kiely; topic: \"The Hidden              Architect: 17th Century Notions of Structural Genesis in the Living             World\"                                                                                                                                                          Since the quantum revolution of the 20th century, the foundations               of the scientific view of the universe is based on contingent                   theories of probability and chance.  Such a view of the world                   around us, however, would have puzzled and perhaps even horrified               natural philosophers who carried out the great scientific                       revolutions of the 16th and 17th centuries.  These \"scientists,\"                whose work established what we know as modern science, shared a                 teleological view of natural objects.  The notion of form played                a crucial role in explaining the generation of both living and non-             living structures in nature.  Earlier studies have examined the                 changing ideas of form in the mineral kingdom as the mechanical                 philosophy rose to prominence in the 17th century.  Mr. Kiely, for              his dissertation research under the direction of Professor Dobbs,               is examining the corresponding views of the period towards the                  living realms of nature.                                                                                                                                        An intensive study of these views promises to reveal 17th century               attitudes towards the relationships between the kingdoms of nature,             as well as those between nature and its creator.  This study would              also help to evaluate the impact of the mechanical philosophy upon              ideas of structure and generation in the living world, and                      illustrate how that philosophy combined with traditional elements               to produce important modern concepts.  Mr. Kiely's study requires               careful examination of the published and unpublished work of those              17th century natural philosophers concerned with questions of life              and structure: van Helmont, Gassendi, Boyle, Hooke, and Grew, among             others.  For this purpose, Mr. Kiely will use this doctoral                     dissertation research grant to travel to England to examine the                 unpublished documents in archives there.",
