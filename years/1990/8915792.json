 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two orthogonal cleat (fracture or joint) sets in anthracite coal                from eastern Pennsylvania contain mineralogically and chemically                distinct authigenic clay minerals which formed during                           coalification.  Minerals in one cleat suggest that metasomatic,                 hydrothermal fluids flowed through these fractures.  This study                 will test the hypothesis that the hydrothermal circulation was                  driven by Alleghanian-age uplift and associated deep basinal                    flow, and will evaluate the contribution of heat by the                         hydrothermal fluids to coalification in this region.  The goal is               to gain a better understanding of the interaction between                       tectonic processes and diagenesis of inorganic and organic                      phases.  To achieve this objective, analytical procedures                       willinclude synchrotron X-ray microprobe, hydrothermal                          experiments (for selected distribution coefficient values),                     deuteron probe, K/Ar and oxygen isotopes, SEM, XRD, petrography,                fixed carbon analysis, electron microprobe, IR spectroscopy and                 computer modeling of the composition, temperature and hydrology                 of paleofluids.  Results may suggest important modifications to                 existing models of coalification and should have impact to                      studies of sedimentary diagenesis, thermal and burial histories                 of sedimentary basins and structural/tectonic studies of the                    Alleghany orogeny.  Finally, we expect to obtain fundamental new                information on the trace element composition of clay minerals.",
