 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goals of Dr. An's work are to understand the                      regulatory mechanisms of gene expression and the molecular basis                of differentiation using plants as a model system. He has been                  working on the nopaline synthesis (nos) promoter to identify cis-               acting regulatory elements of the promoter and to study the                     functional role of these elements. He will continue to study the                nos promoter to further define the sequence specificity of the                  regulatory elements and function of these elements. He will                     focus on the nos upstream regulatory region which consists of                   several cis-acting elements. These elements will be further                     defined by saturation mutagenesis. He proposes to isolate                       regulatory genes whose products specifically interact with the                  nos upstream region by screening a lambda phage expression                      library with the nos promoter fragment as a probe. He will also                 attempt to obtain regulatory mutants from Arabidopsis thaliana                  which fail to turn on the nos promoter during a specific stage of               development. Although the nos promoter is small and originated                  from the Ti plasmid, the promoter consists of several                           interesting regulatory elements that respond to various                         developmental and environmental conditions of plant growth.                     %%%                                                                             The information obtained from the study of this regulator of gene               expression will serve as a useful model for understanding the                   structure and function of complex regulatory mechanisms of                      plants.",
