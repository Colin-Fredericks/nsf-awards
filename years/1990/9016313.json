Dr. Efrat has proposed to investigate a               collection of problems in the harmonic analysis of graphs and                   surfaces that arise as quotients of spaces of rank one, modulo                  discrete groups. These problems stem from questions about the                   existence of discrete spectra for such groups, and the construc-                tion of discrete eigenfunctions for them. Other aspects of                      Professor Efrat's project involve the study of certain arith-                   metically defined Eisenstein series attached to non-congruence                  subgroups.                                                                           Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
