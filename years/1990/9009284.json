 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting funding for the purchase of                                   an X-ray diffractometer for our compound                                        semiconductor materials and devices research.                                   We chose a compact bench top model which is                                     specifically designed for the characterization                                  of compound semiconductors.  This                                               diffractometer will allow us to make precise                                    measurements of the lattice constants of grown                                  epitaxial layers on binary alloy substrates                                     and assess the quality of the epi-layers. Many                                  of the on-going research programs will benefit                                  from the acquisition of the X-ray                                               diffractometer.  Our experimental studies on                                    strained-layers and hetero-epitaxy have mainly                                  relied on optical and electrical                                                characterization techniques.  In order to                                       pursue a thorough investigation more attention                                  must be paid to the structural properties of                                    the materials.  For a number of the device                                      research programs, it is necessary to grow                                      perfectly lattice-matched hetero-junctions for                                  some specific applications.  The X-ray                                          diffractometer will provide us with                                             information on the exact amount of mismatch so                                  that very fine adjustments can be made in the                                   growth parameters to obtain lattice matching.                                   Accurate measure of the mismatch is also                                        required for the study of different strain                                      effects in various III-V material systems.                                      Furthermore, knowledge of the alloy                                             compositions in the heterostructures is                                         important in optimization of the devices and                                    correlation of the device performance to the                                    structural parameters.  X-ray diffraction                                       measurement is the most direct means of                                         determining the alloy compositions in layered                                   structures. We have developed organometallic                                    chemical vapor deposition techniques to grown                                   high quality III-V structures for our material                                  and device research programs.  Addition                                         of a double-crystal X-ray diffractometer will                                   undoubtedly enhance these programs and provide                                  crucial steps for further advancement.",
