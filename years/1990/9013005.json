 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made as the starter grant increment of Dr.                        Hanley's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Chemistry Award in support                  of his research at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The                   thrust of Dr. Hanley's research is the use of sophisticated                     surface spectroscopies to examine the energetic                                 particle-surface interaction.                                                                                                                                   The experiments will investigate chemical reactions of                          molecules on surfaces induced by energetic ion and atom                         bombardment. Vibrational and other non-destructive surface                      spectroscopies will be used to correlate bombardment induced                    surface reactions with molecular mass spectra observed by                       secondary ion, secondary neutral and fast bombardment mass                      spectrometry.  These experiments will be performed on models of                 adsorbate-covered surfaces, organic solids, and multicomponent                  surfaces formed by vapor deposition on single crystal surfaces                  under ultrahigh vacuum conditions.  The role of projectile                      charge state and chemistry will also be examined. These                         experiments will attempt to determine the basic physical                        processes leading to ejection of secondary molecular ions and                   neutrals ultimately leading to an improved interpretation of                    mass spectra of real systems typically probed by energetic                      particle bombardment.",
