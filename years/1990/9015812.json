 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program will support a                     series of three annual \"Workshops on Reactive Intermediates\".                   These workshops have the dual purposes of (1) providing an                      effective forum for informal discussion by active scientists of                 current research in topical areas of organic dynamics, and (2)                  assisting the Program staff in identifying areas of research in                 organic dynamics that should be incorporated into the Program's                 long-range planning.                                                                                                                                            Each workshop will bring together approximately 18 active                       scientists from around the United States for discussions of                     current research in mechanisms of organic chemical reactions,                   with a focus on unpublished results and an emphasis on critical                 evaluation of research in progress.  The informal discussion                    format is intended to stimulate challenge and criticism, to                     facilitate the development of collaborative approaches to                       shared research problems, and to prevent unproductive                           duplicative efforts.   The participants are drawn widely from                   the community of physical, organic, and organometallic chemists                 studying the chemistry of reactive intermediates, and a                         particular effort is made to incorporate young investigators,                   women, and underrepresented minority scientists into the                        mainstream of research activities in the area of organic                        dynamics.  The topics chosen for discussion are selected to                     complement, not compete with, other established and more formal                 conferences.",
