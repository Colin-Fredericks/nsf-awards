 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferry will study a number of topics in controlled topology                 and differential geometry.  Most of these problems bear on the                  problem, \"How much control is enough to force simple homotopy                   equivalence between polyhedra or homeomorphism between                          topological manifolds?\"  An interesting testing ground for                      controlled theories is on the borderline between topology and                   differential geometry, where there are problems which are                       obviously controlled in some way but for which there is no                      obvious control space.  Ferry has already solved one such problem               by, in some sense, letting the problem construct its own control                space.  He plans to explore further ramifications of these                      techniques.",
