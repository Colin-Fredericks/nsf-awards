 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research issue addressed in this research initiation proposal               is to develop a design methodology of corrective filters which                  would recognize and compensate the impact of the working                        environment on the dynamic characteristics of sensors.  Significant             improvements in the accuracy and reliability of measurements may                be possible with these self-tuning sensors to improve the                       performance of existing production systems.  This approach may be               able to improve the feasibility of implementing high performance                control, monitoring and diagnosis of manufacturing systems needed               for the factories of the future.                                                                                                                                The systematic approach to the design of self-tuning sensors for                manufacturing systems will attempt to advance in-process metrology              by integrating two important elements of modern engineering.  These             elements are:  (1)  The modeling of sensors installed on particular             machine tools as components of multi-degree-of-freedom systems.                 The derived models, based on first principles, will encapsulate the             a priori knowledge about the sensors, machines tools and relevant               manufacturing processes; and (2)  the time series based, on-line                identification of real-time parameters of these models in the                   presence of stochastic disturbances.                                                                                                                            The goal of this research is to implement a prototype corrective                filter capable of tracking and compensating the impact of the                   environment on the dynamic performance of typical force and torque              sensors.  This filter will be built as a high speed,                            multi-processor system.",
