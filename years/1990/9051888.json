 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Botany at Ohio State             University to help purchase equipment to be used in a new two-                  quarter course in modern plant biology.  The new course (BOT 102)               includes a completely new laboratory component.  Written by experts             in sub-specialties of plant science, most exercises use the new                 rapid cycling Brassicas and all call for hands-on experimentation               and observation using current technology.  Equipment to be                      purchased with this grant will be used in three of the ten lab                  exercises:  1) For Cell Structure--video cameras, monitors, and                 video recorders will allow the students to observe special cellular             structures and phenomena visible with fluorescent or oil immersion              microscopy...instruments which are prohibitively expensive for                  individual student use. 2)  For Development and Biotechnology--                 sterile transfer hoods will support experiments with plant hormones             using tissue culture techniques.  3)  For Photosynthesis,                       Phototropism, and Phototaxis--the students will use                             spectrophotometers, chart recorders, quantum radiometers,                       centrifuges, balances, etc. to learn how plants absorb and utilize              light efficiently in food production.  The grantee is matching this             award with non-Federal sources.",
