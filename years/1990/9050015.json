 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this five-year project is to develop, field                      test, revise, institutionalize, and disseminate a model                         research-based preservice program to prepare elementary                         teachers for enhanced science, mathematics, and technology                      teaching. A team of eight scientist and ten science educators                   will work in conjunction with 25 experienced elementary                         teachers and four principals to totally restructure the                         courses in content and pedagogy and the field experiences for                   preservice teachers in the preparatory program.  One major                      goal of the work is to coordinate the set of experiences so                     that there is a consistency in the environment and                              epistomological underpinnings for the content and the methods                   courses and the classes in the schools where these students                     will have extensive field experiences.                                                                                                                          The students will take 27 semester hours of mathematics and                     science content.  Eight hours of methods will be distributed                    so that the students will be engaged in thinking about                          teaching elementary school science and mathematics as it                        relates to the particular science or mathematics area being                     emphasized in the content courses.  Each of the methods                         courses will have an accompanying field experience with                         teachers that are knowledgeable about what the students are                     studying at the university.  The program will have students                     engaged in studying science and mathematics and working in                      schools over a three year time span.                                                                                                                            Another important aspect of the work is the careful attention                   that the P.I. and the project staff will pay to evaluating                      the impact of the intervention and its component parts on all                   of those involved--preservice teachers, experienced teachers,                   scientists, science educators, and, most importantly, the                       students of the new elementary teachers in their early years                    of teaching.  The project recognizes that many new teachers                     leave teaching in the first one to three years.  This project                   will provide support for the graduates during the first year                    in an attempt to network these new teachers in such a way                       that more of them will stay in teaching.                                                                                                                        Kansas State University will cost share in excess of 56% of                     the amount requested from NSF.",
