 "awd_abstract_narration": "The work planned in this mathematical sciences group                       research project seeks to combine two approaches to the                         problem of representing signals as expansions of discrete                       sets of functions.  One is through the Gabor transform, the                     other uses the wavelet expansion.  One of the primary goals                     of this research is to combine the two approches using a new                    technique called the multiplicative Zak transform.                              Applications of this work will concentrate on                                   characterizations of non-stationary signals. Algorithms will                    be developed to compute the coefficients of the resulting                       double series expansion and signal properties                                   will be derived from the expansions.                                                 Since the multiplicative Zak transformation can be                         interpreted as the Weil map, it appears in another context                      within the representation theory of the Heisenberg group.                       This theory provides insight into special function theory                       including theta functions and Krautchouk and Poisson-Charlier                   polynomials.  Applications to number theory are also planned.                                                                                                       //",
