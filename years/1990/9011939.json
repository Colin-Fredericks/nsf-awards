For many                     years, research in this country has viewed social influence as                  the process by which the will of the majority is instilled into                 the minority.  Recent European research has focused on the                      compliment of this idea, namely the ways in which the minority                  impacts upon the majority.  This research has produced some                     interesting and provocative deviations from the standard                        findings.  Considerable progress on minority influence has                      occurred in Europe.  In the US, knowledge about factors that                    influence social behavior has grown enormously, but very little                 research has been done specifically on minority influence, which                appears to involve processes somewhat different from those                      involved in more standard majority influence situations.  The two               scientific communities in Europe and the US are in a unique                     position to contribute to one another in terms of theory,                       methods, and established research findings.  This proposal will                 facilitate this process by allowing a group of America's best                   social influence researchers to meet in an intensive workshop                   with Europe's best.  The gains in theory and methodology should                 be remarkable, and have long-term effects on social research in                 America and Europe.  Understanding the factors that affect social               influence, of both majority and minority groups, on majority and                minority groups, has enormous theoretical and practical                         implications.  This research should foster this process of                      understanding.",
