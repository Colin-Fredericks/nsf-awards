 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Colorado Alliance for Science has formed a partnership                      with 14 school districts and Adams State College in the San                     Luis Valley of Colorado.  Their model project is designed to                    improve the teaching of science at the elementary level in a                    rural area by building on local and state resources.  Since                     this area is so isolated the main or only source of science                     education support for most of the elementary teachers is the                    secondary school science teacher in their building.  This                       project aims to take advantage of that relationship by                          educating the elementary and secondary school teachers                          together.  During the program, the elementary school teachers                   will be introduced to the content, pedagogy, and new                            curricular materials available for teaching science to young                    children and the secondary school science teachers will be                      introduced to materials, and ideas which should allow them to                   become better resources for their elementary school                             colleagues.  Teams made up two elementary school teachers,                      one secondary school teacher and one principal will                             participate in the three week summer institutes conducted                       over a three year period.  At the conclusion of each team's                     institute, the teachers and administrator will select the                       science program or collection of science programs to be                         adopted and supported by the local system.  In addition to                      the on-going support provided by the secondary science                          teachers, six in-service sessions will be conducted                             throughout the school year.  These sharing sessions will                        continue with support from the Colorado Alliance for Science                    after the NSF grant is completed as a method for maintaining                    support for teachers and a means of capturing community                         interest.                                                                                                                                                       The cost sharing for the proposal will be at least 43% of the                   NSF portion.",
