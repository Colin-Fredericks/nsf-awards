 "awd_abstract_narration": "Orchids constitute the largest family of monocots, with an                 estimated 20,000 species arranged in ca. 700 genera.  Growing                   worldwide, most commonly in the tropics, they are renowned for                  the color and variety of their flowers and the intricacy of their               pollinating mechanisms with insects and birds.  Less well                       appreciated is the diversity of vegetative structures among                     orchids (roots, stems, and leaves), making possible their growth                in a wide range of habitats, often quite specialized, including                 epiphytes upon other woody plants, subterranean forms, bulbs,                   vines, and shrubs.  Dr. William Stern of the University of                      Florida is surveying the vegetative diversity of orchids to                     compile the first encyclopedic account of root, stem, and leaf                  anatomy of representatives of all 700 genera of the world's                     orchids.                                                                             Working with colleagues in Florida and at the Kew Botanic                  Gardens in England, Dr. Stern will have access to living and                    preserved materials of all recognized orchid genera.  Microscopic               examination of slide preparations will allow standard comparisons               across all the genera.  In turn, comparative study will                         facilitate an evaluation of the range of environmental                          modifications found in orchid structures, and allow                             discrimination between homologous structures (those with a common               genetic and developmental basis) from analogous structures                      (those that look similar in mature form but develop along                       different pathways).  This first comprehensive survey of orchid                 vegetative anatomy will enhance further systematic, ecological,                 and morphological study of these fascinating plants.",
