 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gases that make up the earth's atmosphere are essential for                 life.  As certain of them increase, they contribute to raising the              mean temperature of the earth.  These changes are called \"the                   greenhouse effect.\"  Current debate centers on whether the amount               of warming is increasing, and what role humans play in the process.             This research focuses on the interaction between the scientific                 community engaged in research on the greenhouse effect and mediated             reports of those events in newspapers, news magazines and network               television. Specifically, the research will attempt to delineate                the major areas of scientific findings on greenhouse research                   through an analysis of published scientific literature.  This                   analysis will focus on scholarly journals and examine both the                  content of specific scientific findings and the scholarly citations             used by researchers.  A content analysis of mass media coverage of              the issue will then attempt to trace when and how significant                   scientific findings do or do not appear in the mass media.  The                 mass media content analysis also will attempt to delineate how                  those scientific findings are portrayed in news accounts--in short,             to descirbe and analyze how scientific findings are popularized                 through media accounts.  It is anticipated that this process of                 \"mediating\"  greenhouse research will be governed by norms and                  values of journalistic and scientific behavior, norms and values                reflective not only of both professions but also of other groups                in the society who have a variety of interests in the greenhouse                debate.  The hypothesis for this study is that certain journalistic             norms and values will influence the coverage of the greenhouse                  effect regardless of the particular source of the information and               in some ways largely independent of specific events.  The goal is               to articulate what those values are and to show how they influence              and are influenced by the values and norms of other groups,                     resulting in a mediated public agenda on important issues involving             science and public policy.                                                                                                                                      This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional               support is good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is highly              recommended.",
