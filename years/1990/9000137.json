In particular, she will use eigenfunction                    analysis of the partial differential equations that describe                    oscillations in stratified, rotating, electrically conducting                   fluids and Hamiltonian techniques to study the stability of                     three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium states.                       The behavior of fluids inside of the earth is a very complicated                problem whose solution involves the combined efforts of                         experimentalists and theoreticians.  Essentially both groups                    study simplified models that regard the earth as a rotating ball                of stratified, electrically conducting fluid inside of a magnetic               field.  The principal investigator is a theoretician who will                   investigate among other topics whether certain equilibrium states               are stable to outside perturbations.  Her work has relevance in                 geophysics and in the study of earthquakes.",
