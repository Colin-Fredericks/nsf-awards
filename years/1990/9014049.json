Copepod developmental stages that are the                             preferred food of larval fish will be identified and                            enumerated in fine mesh (.053 mm pore size) spring                              zooplankton samples taken in 1980-83 in the Georges Bank                        and Gulf of Maine nursery areas for cod and haddock.  One                       HU graduate student will focus on 75 Georges Bank samples                       during project years one and two, and a second will                             utilize 91 Gulf of Maine samples during years two and                           three.  They and undergraduate student assistants will                          interact with scientists in the Plankton Ecology                                Investigation at the NEC Narragansett Laboratory.  The                          graduate students will develop masters theses that apply                        statistical analyses to new data from the fine mesh                             samples and existing data from coarse mesh samples to test                      hypotheses concerning the relative spatial and temporal                         distributions of zooplankton and ichthyoplankton in the                         study area.  Estimation of secondary production of copepod                      nauplii, employing production/biomass ratios or cohort                          analyses, will be attempted.  The fine mesh data will be                        added to the MARMAP Ecosystem Data Base at NEC, and the                         students will be advanced in their preparation for marine                       science careers.",
