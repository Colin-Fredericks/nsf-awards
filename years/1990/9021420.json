 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed four-month planning grant will create an                           interinstitutional consortium known as the Southwest                            Minority Alliance.  The Alliance will develop a five-year                       plan to implement a series of recommendations from recent                       national reports focusing on minority participation in                          science and engineering at the undergraduate and graduate                       levels.  Five components will initially serve as                                cornerstones of the Alliance:                                                                                                                                   1.)  Formation of institutional consortium to pool counseling                        and transitional support resources from high school to                          undergraduate school to graduate school;                                                                                                                                                                                                   2.)  Development of clear articulation agreements to offer                           binding transfer from one participating institution to                          another;                                                                                                                                                   3.)  Operation of residential summer science and academies                           for students beginning at the seventh-grade level to                            enrich science knowledge and experience;                                                                                                                   4.)  Establishment of a freshman-year, college-based program                         to increase student participation and opportunities for                         success in undergraduate programs in science and                           engineering;                                                                                                                                                    5.)  Involvement of the private sector in educational                           enhancement activities such as tutoring, mentoring, and                         advising minority students.                                                                                                                                     During the four-month planning period the Southwest Minority                    Alliance will create and mobilized the infrastructure                           necessary to carry each of these components forward during                      the implementation phase.  The Alliance members will                            devise innovative means to increase the retention and                           baccalaureate acquisition rates of minority students                            interested in science and engineering careers.",
