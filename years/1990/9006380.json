 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering plants have been classified as self-incompatible                 if they do not set seed following self-pollination, and self-                   compatible if they do.  Recent work shows that this fundamental                 distinction is oversimplified.  Some plants, including the                      glacier lily, can produce selfed seeds if only self pollen is                   applied to the stigma, but will preferentially produce outcrossed               seeds from a mixture of self and outcross pollen.  The proposed                 research uses genetic markers, pollen-color markers, and DNA-                   staining fluorescent pollen-nucleus markers.  Novel techniques                  for transplanting styles and for determining the genetics of                    aborted seeds will be combined with the markers to isolate the                  post-pollination stage(s) at which preferential ourcrossing is                  expressed following mixed pollinations.  The possible role of                   inbreeding effects will receive special attention.                                   The result should constitute the most complete investigation               to date of a little known, cryptic \"incompatibility\" process that               can potentially determine the level of inbreeding in a                          population.  Such knowledge will enrich any attempts to                         understand the function and evolution of plant reproductive                     systems, and may have practical utility in agricultural plant                   breeding, especially in the production of inbred lines for hybrid               seed production.",
