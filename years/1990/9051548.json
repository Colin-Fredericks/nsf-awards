 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Atmospheric Science at the State                         University of New York at Albany would like to improve the                      quality and breadth of its undergraduate teaching and laboratory                experience for both majors and non-majors through the purchase of               a next-generation Man-Computer-Interactive Data Access System                   (McIDAS).  With such a system users can effectively process and                 analyze digital meteorological satellite images as well as more                 conventional meteorological global surface and upper air                        observations for instructional, laboratory and research purposes.                                                                                                    McIDAS will fill two critical needs.  First it can be used                 in the classroom to expose nonscience majors to scientific ideas,               concepts and methods that can have impact on their daily lives,                 allowing them to become more informed citizens about global                     weather, climate and environmental issues.  Second is the need to               increase opportunities for undergraduate students majoring in                   atmospheric science to be exposed to fundamental meteorological                 concepts and quantitative approaches to problems through                        independent study, undergraduate research projects, synoptic                    laboratory applications, classroom projects and problem sets, as                well as curriculum enrichment, by integrating McIDAS more                       effectively into day-to-day classroom and laboratory teaching.                                                                                                       The next generation McIDAS addresses these critical                        Departmental needs because of the local computer power and                      enhanced graphics capability built into the wideword workstation.                                                                                               The quality of the undergraduate teaching and laboratory                        experience would be improved considerably because for the first                 time instructors would be able to process, analyze and archive                  global weather and climate cases of interest for later                          instructional and research purposes.  Additionally faculty                      members and students wold be able to apply locally generated                    scientific software packages on McIDAS to real time or archived                 datastreams as well as link into other local or national computer               systems for the processing and analysis of additional data in                   support of special laboratory and research projects",
