 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores methods for improving the performance of                  parallel discrete-event simulation by combining features of both                conservative and optimistic synchronization strategies.  Rather than            attempting to avoid rollback, which is accomplished by slowing down             the fastest components of the simulation, the strategy is to avoid              state checkpointing, which should speed up the slowest components.                                                                                              The project is experimental in nature.  A single implementation will            allow one to make fair comparisons between the performance of pure              conservative synchronization, and a hybrid method.  Furthermore, by             adding a mechanism for limiting the degree of optimism in both the              pure optimistic and the hybrid cases, it will be possible to verify or          refute the hypothesis that the overhead of optimistic rollback is a             second-order effect compared to the overhead of state checkpointing.            Subject to the successful verification of this hypothesis, this                 research will continue with heuristics for dynamically adapting the             degree of optimism in a simulation during its execution.",
