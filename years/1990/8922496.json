 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in mechanical                    engineering between Dr. Harindra Fernando, Arizona State University             and Dr. J.C.R. Hunt, Department of Applied Mathematics and                      Theoretical Physics, University of Cambridge, England.  The                     objective of the proposed research is an investigation of the                   structure of turbulence near density interfaces.  The research will             be mainly of a theoretical/numerical nature (to be carried out at               the University of Cambridge), but complementary laboratory                      experiments (to be performed at Arizona State University) are                   also proposed.                                                                                                                                                  The development of a clear understanding of the physical processes              associated with turbulent mixing across density interfaces and the              modelling of such phenomena continue to be challenging problems                 in fluid mechanics. The proposed research will be based on a new                technique, the so-called \"kinematic simulation of turbulence\",                  which has been developed by Dr. Hunt's group at Cambridge.  This                particular approach differs from earlier ones in the sense that                 the effects of \"small\" turbulent eddies, advected over the                      interface by randomly moving \"large\" eddies of different sizes and              frequencies, are explicitly considered.  The internal-wave                      generation at the interface is directly related to this advection.              The analysis will be performed for several flow configurations of               geophysical and engineering interest, that include density                      interfaces subjected to velocity shear and zero-mean-shear                      turbulence.  The theoretical predictions will be compared with                  the laboratory measurements.  The results of this study will                    contribute substantially to the understanding of turbulent mixing               across density interfaces. The project will benefit from the                    extensive and complementary expertise of the two investigators on               the topic of turbulence in homogenous, stratified and rotating                  flows.",
