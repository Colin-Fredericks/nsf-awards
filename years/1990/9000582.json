 "awd_abstract_narration": "Symmetry plays an important role in mathematics, physics,                  and other sciences.  In mathematics, symmetry has many different                but related manifestations.  A finite group G of symmetries of a                space X induces symmetries on algebraic invariants of X.  In this               way, transformation groups and representation theory become                     intimately related.  In this project, the investigator will look                systematically at the interaction between the geometry of the                   symmetry (e.g., fixed points, stability subgroups, etc.) and the                algebraic invariants of such representations.  In particular,                   symmetries of Moore spaces (the Steenrod Problem posed in early                 1960's) and algebraic curves and surfaces arising in algebraic                  geometry and number theory (besides topology) provide concrete                  problems to which the following general theory will apply.  A                   significant feature of this project is its interdisciplinary                    nature, which requires tools and ideas from several branches of                 mathematics.  This provides a natural setting for interaction of                these areas, including new applications of algebraic geometry to                transformation groups and modular representation theory.  Other                 applications include (algorithmic and inductive) construction of                important classes of modular representations, number theoretic                  properties of algebraic function fields, and a deeper                           understanding of symmetries of algebraic surfaces versus 4-                     dimensional manifolds.  A long term objective is solution of the                long-standing Steenrod Problem and its application to the problem               of existence of symmetry for manifolds.",
