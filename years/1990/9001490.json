 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides one year of partial subsidy for the Mid-                  America Drosophila Stock Center.  Drosophila, or \"fruit flies,\"                 are essential experimental animals which are used extensively in                genetics research.  The Mid-America Center maintains 4,061 genetic              strains of the most important fruit-fly species, Drosophila                     melanogaster, which are distributed to institutions around the                  world for research and teaching purposes.  From 1985 to 1989, over              12,000 requests for flies were received and nearly 59,000 stocks                were mailed to all 50 states and over 50 foreign countries.  These              stocks include basic mutants as well as complex mutant combinations             and chromosome rearrangements.  It is essential that such stocks                be maintained because they represent many man-years of genetic                  research and are difficult, and in some cases impossible, to re-                isolate or re-synthesize.  In addition, it is much too expensive                for each researcher utilizing Drosophila to maintain the full range             of stocks it envisions it will need.  It is certain that                        curtailment of the activities of the Mid-America Center would                   seriously affect genetics research worldwide.",
