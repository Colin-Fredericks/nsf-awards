 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Laurie J. Butler is supported by a grant from the                           Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the time                       evolution of molecular dissociation processes from                              electronically excited molecules. These measurements will allow                 for an enhanced detailed understanding of how molecules                         decompose and form various sub-molecular moieties or of how                     chemical species react with other systems.                                                                                                                      The initial experiments use polarized emission spectroscopy,                    which measures the wavelength and polarization of the photons                   emitted during dissociation, to probe the change in the nuclear                 dynamics induced by forces at a conical intersecton along the                   dissociative pathway. Professor Butler focuses on determining                   the change in the dissociation dynamics and the branching                       between energetically allowed fragmentation products induced by                 1) the presence of a conical intersection along the                             dissociation pathway, 2) the excitation of a selected                           vibrationally activated molecule to the electronically                          dissociative state, allowing access to the excited potential                    surface beyond the Franck-Condon region, and 3) the change in                   the nonadiabatic coupling between two dissociative electronic                   states when a vibrationally excited molecule is promoted to the                 dissociative surface.",
