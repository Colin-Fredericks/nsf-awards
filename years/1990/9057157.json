 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual-site and individual-species techniques will be                       developed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of cooperativity                    in regulatory calcium-binding proteins such as calbindin nd                     calmodulin.  This class of proteins regulates the cellular                      response to transient calcium fluxes in almost every tissue                     type.  Cooperative calcium binding to these proteins causes                     large and specific conformational transitions that modulate                     protein-protein interactions by controlling the sites and                       extent of their binding to important cellular enzymes or                        structural proteins.  To understand the molecular mechanism of                  cooperative calcium binding and its ramifications new methods                   are needed that can probe the intermediate states of binding.                   One planned approach is to apply the cryogenic isoelectric                      focusing technique to isolate partially saturated calcium-                      binding proteins and complexes of calcium-binding proteins with                 their target enzymes.  This will allow the quantitation of                      intermediate states of the protein assemblies and the                           determination of which ones are functionally significant.                       Analysis of these experiments will use non-linear least squares                 methods to determine model-independent thermodynamic and                        kinetic parameters.  Classical binding methods (such as                         equilibrium dialysis) and spectroscopic techniques (CD,                         fluorescence, n.m.r.) also will be applied. Statistical                         thermodynamic models that will describe the functionally                        significant properties of the system in terms of the relevant                   chemical species and the rules that govern transitions between                  them will be formulated.  This will allow a test of whether the                 identified physico-chemical properties of the system components                 are necessary and sufficient to account for the biological                      behavior.  It may also assist in design of drugs that mimic                     these interactions.  The coupling of ligand binding and                         conformational change within the calcium-binding protein and                    its linkage to assembly of an activated enzyme complex offer                    many opportunities to test and expand ideas about chemical                      work, free energy coupling and dynamic control of cellular                      events.  These findings will have broad applicability to other                  biological systems.",
