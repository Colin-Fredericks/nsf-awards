 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on this project focuses on two general areas of                       harmonic analysis.  The first concerns stability of Fredholm                    properties in interpolation scales.  It is motivated by a                       recurring theme inthe theory of partial differential equations                  defined in domainswith relatively irregular boundaries (Lipschitz               domains).  Namely, when the operators which associate boundary                  values with solutions are known to be bounded in a certain                      Lebesgue p-norm say the quadratic - then they turn out to be                    bounded across alarger range of values of p.  The work to be done               involves extensions of 'stability range' to larger classes of                   operators on Banach spaces.  Goals include finding upper bounds                 for the length of the range and reducing assumptions currently in               force regarding the dimension of the null space of the operators.                    The second line of investigation relates to efforts                        extending classical results on Rademacher and Walsh series,                     especially in the context of series with large gaps.  It is known               that in such circumstances, the quadratic norm the coefficients                 of a series is bounded by the maximum norm of the sum of the                    series.  If the series involved are trigonometric, then the                     maximum norm must be replaced by p-norms.  Recent results have                  extended the classical comparisons to include the bounded mean                  oscillation norm.  Work will now be done to obtain more general                 BMO estimates for the same type of problem where the series are                 restricted to measurable sets rather than intervals.  The first                 hurdle to be overcome is that of drafting a proper definition of                BMO for sets of functions defined on other than intervals.                           Support for this project will be restricted to graduate                    student stipends and travel allowance.",
