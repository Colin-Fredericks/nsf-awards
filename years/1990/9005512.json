 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's goal is to use a new approach to simplify the                     kinetic and thermodynamic study of human erythrocyte glucose-6-                 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) that involves the control of the                 enzyme's state of association.  G6PD is a key enzyme in the                     hexosemonophosphate pathway and over 370 genetic variants of the                human erythrocyte enzyme have been identified. Individuals with                 G6PD deficiencies can suffer hemolytic crisis on exposure to a                  variety of drugs or foods.  The large number of genetic variants,               many with reduced activity, mae G6PD an attractive target for                   cloning and sequencing.  The interpretation of the changes in                   amino acid sequence are dependent on the measurement of G6PD's                  biochemical properties.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of                      agreement on many of the basic enzymatic properties of                          erythrocyte G6PD, namely, the binding of substrates and the                     effect of intercellular molecules on the enzyme's kinetics.  In                 analogy with prior work on yeast G6PD, this proposal's hypothesis               is past kinetic and thermodynamic studies of human erythrocyte                  G6PD measured the properties of a mixture of G6PD dimers and                    tetramers, each of which may have different biochemical                         properties.  This lack of agreement concerning human erythrocyte                G6PD's biochemical properties would arise because the relative                  amounts of G6PD dimers and tetramers changed during the kinetic                 or thermodynamic measurements.  Thus                                            proposal will focus upon measuring the biochemical properties of                the G6PD dimer, the form presumed to be present in the                          erythrocyte.  The three specific aims of the RUI proposal are (1)               to measure the number of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide                      phosphate (NADP) and glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) molecules bound                  to G6PD and the magnitude of the association constant for these                 two molecules. The project will directly measure the equilibrium                quantity of radioactively labeled  G6P, or NADP, bound to the                   enzyme.  The proposal will also (2) quantitatively study the                    inhibition of erythrocyte G6PD kinetics by ATP and 2,3                          diphosphoglycerate, two proposed physiologically important                      inhibitors of G6PD.  The third (3) specific aim will measure the                dimertetramer association constant using large zone (plateau)                   HPLC experiments on a size exclusion column.",
