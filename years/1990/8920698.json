 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells fire electrical impulses by the movement of charged                 ions through the cell membrane.  This ionic current flows through               specialized protein channels which may be restricted to a                       specific type of ion e.g. sodium, potassium or calcium.  The                    amount of current carried by a particular ion and the time it                   occurs during the nerve impulse are important factors in                        determining normal function of the nervous system.                                                                                                              Since many types of ionic channels and subtypes of channels exist               in nature, it is essential to understand their diversity and the                ways in which each channel is regulated.  One possible new type                 of channel, carrying the \"J-current\", has been discovered in the                lobster.  This current is particularly sensitive to the presence                of calcium, which may act as a regulator of channel activity.                   Studying the J-current is important because it is similar to                    ionic currents found in mammalian brain.                                                                                                                        The specific aims of this research are:  (1) to identify the ion                which is responsible for carrying the J-current, (2) to study its               relationship to other ionic currents e.g. potassium current, (3)                to analyze the effect of certain drugs on the J-current and (4)                 to determine its physiological role.  The data collected by this                research may provide insight into the evolution of ionic channels               and the function of ionic channels in higher organisms.",
