 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Dr. Joseph P. Dinnocenzo at the University                   of Rochester, who is studying the reactions of molecules from                   which a single electron has been removed.  Investigations of                    these reactive species will provide fundamental information on                  acid-base reactions and should lead to new methodology in                       synthetic organic chemistry.                                                                                                                                    The experiments to be carried out by Dr. Dinnocenzo will                        comprise two related investigations of cation radicals.                         The first is designed to provide a detailed understanding of                    the kinetic acidities of tertiary amine cation radicals and                     alkylaromatic cation radicals.  Preparation, characterization,                  and proton-transfer studies of isolable cation radical salts                    will afford kinetic and thermodynamic data that will help to                    identify the similarities and differences between cation                        radical deprotonations and those of neutral, closed-shell                       organic molecules.  The second investigation is designed to                     elucidate the scope, mechanism, and synthetic applications of                   cation radical reactions for cyclopropanes having unsaturated                   substituents.",
