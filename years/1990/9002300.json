This instrument will be initially used in five research programs:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1. Role of pigments and protein in thylakoid membrane                              biogenesis.                                                                  2. Analysis of synthetic amyloid peptides.                                      3. Structural resolution of plant anti-herbivore                                   secondary metabolites.                                                       4. Structural/functional relationships of protein upon                             gelation.                                                                    5. Structure/activity relationship in a bacterial                                  decardoxylase.                                                                                                                                     Undergraduate students participate in the above research programs               during the academic year and during summer as part of the REU                   program.  Some of the current projects involving undergraduates                 are:                                                                                                                                                                      1. Analysis of protein synthesis in the brains of                                  salmon during smoltification.                                                2. Heavy metal toxicity effects on photosynthetic                                  membranes at the level of gene expression.                                   3. Effect of plant secondary metabolites from forest                               floor litter on rates of microbial nitrification.                            4. Structure a diterpene isolated from Colophospermum                              mophane.                                                                                                                                           The spectropolarimeter will also be used in laboratory portion of               undergraduate courses.  This instrument will be a significant                   addition of the University's instrumentation capabilities.  Since               this will be the only spectropolarimeter available in the state,                it will function as a regional instrument for users at other                    state campuses as well as at other University sponsored research                institutes.",
