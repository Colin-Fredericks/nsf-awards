 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the importance of public sector financial / accounting                  decisions, there has been little analytical work on the topic.                  Although political scientists have looked at the underlying                     political processes in public organizations, very few studies have              tried to explore the antecedents and consequences of the specific               accounting practices used.  This proposal outlines a research                   program to explore decisions made by state / local government about             financial reporting and auditing.                                                                                                                               By combining the study of accounting practices with analyses of                 organizational structure and processes, the proposed research takes             an innovative approach.  The project promises to contribute (1) to              fundamental research on organizational theory in the public sector              and (2) to improvements in public sector decision making by                     management.  These contributions are made more likely by the                    application of a research approach which recognizes the unique                  functions and powers of public sector organizations.  The principal             investigator has both the background and the insights needed to                 make the project successful.  In summary, the proposed research                 will lead to valuable new insights and applications in public                   decision making.",
