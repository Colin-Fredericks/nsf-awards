 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well known that neutral atoms or molecules of various                origins, e.g. interstellar, cometary, or planetary, exist                       pervasively in interplanetary space.  When these neutral                        particles get sufficiently close to the Sun, they can be ionized,               for example by solar ultraviolet radiation.  Consequently, the                  freshly created ions would interact with the moving solar wind.                 In recent years, research in this topic area has been spurred by                in site observations at comets Giacobini-Zinner and Halley and                  attracted considerable interest and attention from the scientific               community. I this work, a series of theoretical studies will be                 conducted relating to ion creation and structure in the solar                   wind.  These include (1) further studies of ion pickup and                      subsequent development in a solar wind, (2) problems relevant to                the stability and thermalization of ions in a pickup state, (3)                 and possible processes leading to assimilation of the newborn                   ions by the solar wind.  Both analytical theory and numerical                   simulation techniques will be used in the proposed studies.  ***",
