The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Jerome B. Cohen                      will support a twelve month visit to the United Kingdom by                      Dr. John P. Quintana to work with Prof. Michael Hart of the                     University of Manchester on \"Development of Stable Si and Ge                    Single Crystal Monochromators Under High Heat Loads.\"                           Synchrotron radiation has become an extremely important tool                    in material studies.  Insertion devices greatly increase the                    flux to the point where heat load induced physical distortions                  of the optical elements limit the flux and resolution of the                    final beam. The heat load problem will be more severe on the                    next generation synchrotrons such as the Advanced Photon                        Source (APS) and the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility                    (ESRF).  Consequently, new optics, including monochromator                      designs are necessary to fully exploit the capabilities of                      these high brightness sources.  The proposed study will                         develop stable monochromators for current high brightness                       synchrotron radiation sources as well as very high power                        sources (APS and ESRF).  The basic method will be to improve                    on the basic thin wall adding the capability to elastically                     distort the crystal to counter deformations at high heat loads.                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
