 "awd_abstract_narration": "The human eye detects light by a sheet of specialized                           photoreceptor cells and nerve cells called the retina, at the                   back of the eye.  Light energy is described in terms of units                   called quanta; the conversion of light energy to a neural signal                output by the cell is called transduction.  The electrical                      response within the photoreceptors is initiated by the fastest                  chemical reactions known.  Despite the speed of these reactions,                the total response time for the output of these cells is rather                 slow, to as much as a tenth of a second, because there is a                     cascade of biochemical reactions that effectively act to amplify                the signal energy.  Two basic kinds of photoreceptors, called                   rods and cones, initiate visual signals in the retina which then                are sent to the brain by the optic nerve.  The cone system is                   usually used for color vision in strong daylight illumination,                  while the rod system is very sensitive to low light level but                   does not carry color information by itself.  This project                       examines the component mechanisms of the cone transduction                      process in the human eye, using human responses to obtain                       thresholds for seeing stimulus lights of highly controlled                      duration and intensity.  Measurements will be made of responses                 to single flashes from the cone system when it is in a state of                 dark adaptation, of the number of quanta absorbed at the absolute               threshold for different cone types, and of the different time                   components in the dark-adapted cone responses.  This novel                      approach will generate important new fundamental information on                 normal human vision that will have impact on further                            understanding the biochemistry and physiology of vision in                      general.",
