 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general question addressed by this project is: Which performance            increases are achievable in practice from parallelizing an existing             large Computer Algebra application when using \"threads\" (lightweight            processes) on a shared memory machine?  In particular, what is the              lowest level of algebraic computation at which significant speed-ups            can be obtained by exploiting the medium-grained parallelism provided           by threads?                                                                                                                                                     The concrete research objective is to develop a framework for parallel          programming in the ALDES/SAC-2 Computer Algebra System, and to                  effectively parallelize a significant part of the existing system.              The environment for parallelization will be C-threads on an Encore              Multimax.  System oriented work will modify SAC-2 to allow large scale          development of a parallelized system, including running existing code           in parallel.  In algorithms oriented work, targets for parallelization          include the existing algorithms for the computation of Cylindrical              Algebraic Decomposition, polynomial resultants, polynomial GCD's,               polynomial real-root isolation, and arithmetic in basic algebraic               domains.  The complete system will then provide empirical data which            will help estimate the practical potential of new parallel algorithms           proposed in the literature.",
