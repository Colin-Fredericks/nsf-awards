 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to determine                           quantitatively, the interactive regulatory factors and underlying               mechanisms of predator-prey dynamics in a marine soft-bottom                    community. The researchers have extensive background knowledge as               well as an innovative ultrasonic biotelemetry techniques to                     examine the predator-prey complex in a small sub-estuary (the                   Rhode River) of Chesapeake Bay.  The researchers will measure the               components of predator behavior which lead to changes in the                    functional and aggregative responses. The predator-prey complex                 includes large blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) which feed on two               common species of infaunal clams (Macoma balthica and Mya                       arenaria) as well as cannibalizing small blue crabs.  Demersal                  fish are also abundant predators which feed extensively on clam                 siphons and other benthic invertebrates which live in the                       sediments, but not on large whole clams.  Earlier work focused on               the interactive effects of prey species, sediment type, and prey                density on the persistence of prey encountering intense                         predation, with emphasis on the functional response of blue crabs               foraging on clams.  Biotelemetry has been used to determine the                 scales of variation in predator behavior and movement between key               prey patches.  Thus, these investigatins focus on the blue crab's               aggregative response with prey patches, which links the                         regulatory factors, underlying mechanisms, and resulting dynamics               of this predator-prey system. This research will: 1) determine                  the interactive factors (prey species, prey density, and predator               density) regulating the aggregative response of the main predator               (large blue crabs); 2) determine the interactive factors (density               and distribution of prey, habitat refugia, and predator density)                regulating predation rates upon two alternate prey (clams and                   small crabs); and 3) investigate the behavioral/physiological                   mechanisms of large blue crabs aggregating in prey patches and                  switching between small crabs and clams.",
