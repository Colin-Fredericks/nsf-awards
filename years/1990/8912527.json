 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Joseph               Justice, Emory University, and Dr. Urban Ungerstadt, Department of              Pharmacology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.  The                     objective of the research is to investigate dopamine neurochemistry             and to better characterize microdialysis, a new method of monitoring            the chemistry of dopamine and other neuro-transmitters, metabolites             and related compounds.                                                                                                                                          The two laboratories cooperating in this project are the leading                ones involved in the rapidly emerging technique of in vivo                      dialysis.  This technique has already been shown to be useful to                examine the chemical composition of the extracellular fluid of the              brain.  The proposed research will continue the investigation of                the effect of dialysis on the surrounding tissue, investigate ways              to relate the chemical information obtained to the synaptic                     region, and specifically examine the role of uptake of catechola-               mines in dopaminergic neurons.  The project will involve mathema-               tical modeling of the dopaminergic nerve terminal.  New data from               the two laboratories will be incorporated into the model.  Uptake               and inhibition of uptake will be a particular focus of effort.  In              addition, the microdialysis sampling methodology in use in both                 laboratories to study dopamine will be characterized.  The charac-              terization will consist of a mathematical analysis of the diffusion             profiles created during sampling of the extracellular fluid.  This              will provide important new information about a technique that is                being increasingly used in many laboratories in the United States               and Europe.",
