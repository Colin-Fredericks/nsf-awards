Such dependencies constitute a                     considerable theoretical challenge, since the abstract structural               knowledge required to reliably format the discontinuous elements                does not straightforwardly mesh with articulatory requirement of                incremental, word-by-word production.  The dependencies to be                   explored are, primarily, number agreement between subjects and                  verbs, and, secondarily, number agreement between subjects and                  subject anaphors.  Because verb agreement in English may call on                a range of information about number from the nonlinguistic                      message, from the lexicon, from the morphology, and from other                  sources, it offers many opportunities to examine the transmission               and interaction of information during language production.                      Conversely, because it exhibits strict syntactic conditioning, it               offers opportunities to observe constraints on the transmission                 and interaction of information.  Predictions about the nature of                information transmission and the types of constraints likely to                 operate are derived from an approach to production developed by                 Garrett (1975, 1988) and elaborated by others (Bock, 1987a;                     Lapointe, 1985; Lapointe & Dell, 1989; Levelt, 1989).  The                      experiments employ agreement-error elicitation tasks in tandem                  with timed pronunciation tasks to explore the nature of the                     number information used in the agreement operation, the nature of               subject identification and maintenance operations, and the                      processing demands of agreement implementation.",
