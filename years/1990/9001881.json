The investigation will result                 in a complete and unified account of the geometric and algebraic                approaches to this classification problem, as well as a complete                description of the relationship between this algebra and                        geometry. The investigator will also study an extension of these                methods to the complex numbers and to several real variables.                        The work to be completed by the principal investigator has                 as one of its ramifications the complete understanding of tilings               of the plane by tiles invariant under some sort of discrete group               action.  These have been of interest to mathematicians for more                 than a century and their study was recently revived by W.                       Thurston.  Connections between this investigation and the                       topology of three dimensional hypersurfaces as well as to                       dynamical systems, abound.",
