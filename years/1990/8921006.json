 "awd_abstract_narration": "Patterns of dispersal in mammalian population have a                       profound impact on genetic structure, population dynamics and                   social behavior.  In the past the migratory processs has been                   poorly understood, in large part becuase there have been few                    attempts to follow migrating males from one troop to another.                   The goal of this study is to conduct observations of male                       transfer and dispersal in a population of yellow baboons in the                 Tana River Primate Reserve, eastern Keya.  Observation of                       subadult and adult male baboons in three known habituated groups,               as well as periodic censuses of three additional adjacent baboon                groups, will provide data on the patterns of male transfer and                  tactics used by individual males in immigration.  Moreover,                     through the analysis of polymorphism in single copy genes in                    nuclear DNA coupled with DNA fingerprinting, paternity of infants               will be determined and a quantitative measure of the efficacy of                male reproductive tactics will be obtained.  The role of females                in influencing patterns of male transfer will be assessed, along                with measurement of the effects of seasonal patterns of rainfall                and the availability of food.",
