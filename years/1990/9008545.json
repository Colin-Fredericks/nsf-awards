 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among many unique animals and plants on the island of                      Madagascar are more than forty species of lemuriform primates.                  In terms of skeletal anatomy these animals represent the best                   living analogues for the earliest euprimates (Eocene Adapidae and               Omomyidae).  Thus, a study of the positional behavior (posture                  and locomotion) of these animals is crucial for a thorough                      understanding of the locomotor system of early primates.                        Although aspects of social behavior and ecology of Malagasy                     lemurs have been the subject of several studies, positional                     behavior has not received the detailed, objective, quantitative                 scrutiny it needs in order to generate the kinds of data most                   useful for integration with morphological and historical studies.               The purpose of this project is to collect such data for six                     species of Malagasy lemurs living among a community of 12 species               at Ranomafana National Park.  The number of species, ranges of                  body sizes, phylogenetic diversity, and microhabitats represented               by these animals allow many crucial comparisons to be made which                test the influence of various factors on the expressions of                     positional behavior.  The results generated from this study will                be compared with similar studies on other primates, with the aim                of generating and testing the nature and regularity of the                      influence of body size, habitat structure, and heritage on                      primate positional behavior.",
