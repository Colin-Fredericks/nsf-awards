 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is the re-creation of                an object from images of serial sections, for the purpose of                    examining the interrelationships of its parts.  Dr. Hibbard will                use this technique to investigate the structure-function of the                 median eminence of the hypothalamus.  By reconstructing the                     microvasculature within this distinctive but complex brain                      region, he will help understand how the hypothalamus and the                    pituitary regulate the flow of hormones into the blood stream.                  Moreover, the microarchitecture of this system may elucidate                    systems of communication as of yet unrecognized, and may uncover                mechanisms that may contribute greatly to our understanding of                  blood flow in the brain.  Within the context of studying this                   major biological question, Dr. Hibbard will continue to develop                 specific methods that will advance the technology of 3D                         reconstruction.  Specifically, he is working on the procedures to               compute image alignment and feature extraction required for                     reconstructions without manual tracing.  This would allow the                   objectivity and analytic flexibility unattainable with                          conventional methods which opens major opportunities for                        important investigations in all areas of anatomy as well as                     spatially based problems in other fields of physical science and                engineering.   As problems addressed in the neurosciences are                   expanded and rely more on computational methods, the development                and the implementation of these methods for the analysis of brain               using 3D reconstruction will be of great benefit to science and                 engineering and to education.  Indeed the effectiveness of 3D                   visual images in teaching anatomy has already been demonstrated                 within the classroom.",
