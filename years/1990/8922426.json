 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observations in 1987-1989 of Eurasian Arctic sea ice with                       high sediment content raise questions of consequences for                       ice melting, ice modeling, and paleoenvironmental                               reconstructions.  During 1990 and 1991 it is proposed to                        investigate sediment transport by sea ice by identifying the                    sources of the sediment, examining the development of                           sediment-laden floes and assessing the climatic impact of                       sediment inclusions in sea ice.                                                                                                                                 The sediment sources will be identified by comparing                            existing sediment samples from western Eurasian Arctic sea                      ice floes to analyses of sea floor sediment from the                            Siberian Seas.  Sediment incorporation by river discharge                       during spring breakup, and aeolian transport by costal dust                     storms will be assessed based on LANDSAT imagery of the                         Siberian shelf seas.  In addition, the history and                              development of sediment-laden multi-year floes will be                          deciphered.                                                                                                                                                     The potential climatic impact of sediment-laden sea ice                         within the context of varying environmental scenarios will                      be estimated using a coupled energy balance climatic-sea ice                    model, which incorporates a modified version of the                             parameterization of the effect of \"dirty\" inclusions on snow                    and ice albedo used in Ledley and Thompson (1986).",
