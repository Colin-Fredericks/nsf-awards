 "awd_abstract_narration": "This summer FASEB conference on Folate, Vitamin B12 and One-                    Carbon Metabolism is held every two years; this year it will be                 held at Saxtons River on 7/29 - 8/3/90.  There have been                        exciting new developments in each of the nine areas to be                       discussed at the conference.  Previously unrecognized roles of                  folates and folate analogs have been delineated, as have                        previously unrecognized roles for non-cobalamin corrinoids,                     cobalomins and particular intermediates in one carbon metabolism.               New discoveries in intermediary one carbon metabolism in                        anaerobes, particularly steps involving folate and B12, have                    altered the field.  New knowledge has emerged on the nature of                  the involvement of folate and corrinoids in the integrity of the                nervous system; on the role of vitamin transport, delivery, and                 storage proteins in mediating folate and cobalamin metabolism;                  and on the roles of these vitamins in mediating the production of               their delivery proteins and receptor proteins.  Cloning of the                  genes for these proteins is playing an important role.",
