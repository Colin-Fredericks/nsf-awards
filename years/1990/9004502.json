 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the Miocene Epoch, 5-24 million years ago, there was                an extensive radiation of hominoid primates in the Eastern                      Hemisphere.  Their relationships with each other and with extant                taxa are still unclear.  Their functional anatomy and locomotor                 adaptations are clearly different from those of extant primates.                This proposal seeks to characterize this radiation by descriptive               and functional analyses, and by defining postcranial features by                which Miocene taxa may be recognized as hominoids, or as                        primitive catarrhines.  The research will continue the PI's                     previous studies on Sivapithecus, Kenyapithecus, and the recently               discovered Simiolus, Turkanapithecus, and Afropithecus.  The                    study will include studies of recently collected specimens, and                 on new specimens collected during the proposed research period.                 Functional analyses will be made of the postcrania of all known                 small apes from Kenya, comparisons will be made between Miocene                 catarrhines and platyrrhines, and possible indicators of                        terrestriality in Miocene hominoids will be explored.",
