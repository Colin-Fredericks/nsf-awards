Dr.                  Sen's project consists of two parts: the first is to relate the                 generalized Hodge-Tate structure of the representation to the                   various p-adic liftings of global Galois representations over the               prime field in characteristic p. The other part is to extend                    previous work of Dr. Sen that described p-adic field extensions                 by means of certain semi-linear integral representations of p-                  power cyclic groups.                                                                 Except for counting, number theory, which is the study of                  the properties of the whole numbers, is the oldest branch of                    mathematics. In modern days, problems in number theory have                     furnished the driving force to creation of new mathematics in the               fields of pure algebra, analysis, and geometry; some of the most                recent and most astonishing applications of number theory have                  appeared in theoretical computer science and coding theory.",
