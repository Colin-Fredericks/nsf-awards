 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will enable undergraduate students taking                      courses in the Climate & Meteorology Program to have direct                     experience with climatological instrumentation.  This will affect               both majors and non-majors as the intention is to introduce                     students to exposure to equipment in the three introductory                     courses as well as selected advanced courses.  The new equipment                will allow students to undertake measurements in laboratories and               to prepare individual research projects which will link local                   weather conditions, which they have measured, to the synoptic                   conditions.  The advanced students will be able to take courses                 in measurement theory and techniques, micrometeorology and                      hydroclimatology, where they will become familiar with the state-               of-the-art techniques for measuring the transport of energy and                 water, and the wind temperature and humidity profiles from the                  ground to approximately 1.5 km into atmosphere.  To permit this                 the equipment that will be purchased will consist of introductory               weather stations, electronic micrometeorological equipment,                     anemometers, psychrometers, time domain reflectometry soil                      moisture system, sonic anemometer thermometer, lyman alpha                      hygrometer, bowen ratio system, and a tethersonde system.  In the               U.S. exposure to micrometeorological instrumentation is                         relatively limited at undergraduate level but has been found to                 be successful in Australia,  Canada and New Zealand, even at                    first year level.  This would permit a similar type of beneficial               learning experience to be had for students taking courses in the                Climate & Meteorology Program.",
