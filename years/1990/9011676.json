 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a part of the coordinated research program in seismic                   precast concrete structures.  This project focuses on the                       study of connections of precast concrete structures.                                                                                                            The response of precast concrete structures to earthquake                       loading is governed largely by the behavior of the connectons.                  Before precast concrete can be widely used in seismic regions,                  suitable connections must be developed.  The behavior of                        individual connections influences the response of the total                     structural system, which in turn dictates the loads and                         ductility demands on the connection.  Establishing suitable                     connection characteristics thus involves an interaction                         between testing, analytical modeling of the connector force-                    displacement relationships, and dynamic analyses of the                         response of the complete structural system.                                                                                                                     The objective of the project is to provide a framework within                   which the necessary developments can take place.  Potentially                   suitable connections are to be identified from present                          practice and classified according to the nature of their                        primary resistance (e.g. axial force or shear).  Ways of                        combining or improving them by design will be investigated.                     Analytical models will be generated.  Based on performance                      predictions from seismic response analysis, suitable                            connections will be selected for physical testing in                            subsequent studies, and the parameters to be varied in the                      tests will be identified.",
