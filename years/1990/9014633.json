 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables Colby College to connect to NSFNET through              a 56,000 bit per second link to the mid-level network NEARnet, the              New England Academic and Research Network.  Access to NSFNET                    provides the faculty and students with access to supercomputers,                data archives, a variety of network gateways, automated library                 catalogs, and a wide range of software.  The connection is                      particularly important to Colby, which is located in a relatively               remote section of the country.                                                       It is of value to the natural science students and faculty,                not only giving access to supercomputers, but also in facilitating              joint research with distant collaborators, and providing them with              immediate access to data necessary to their work.  The benefits                 accrue to the social science faculty and students, including those              in the humanities, especially in projects involving quantitative                applications.  Further, as the competititon for the best faculty                grows stiffer each year, the connection to NEARnet and NSFNET will              be a powerful factor in Colby's success in recruiting outstanding               faculty, particularly in the sciences.",
