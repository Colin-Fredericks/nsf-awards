 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Jeffrey Koberstein, Institute of Materials Science, University                  of Connecticut and Dr. Yves Gallot, Institute Charles Sadron,                   Strasbourg, France.  The objective of the project is to                         investigate the interfacial activity of block copolymers                        added to immiscible polymer blends.                                                                                                                             The modification of polymer-polymer interfaces is a problem                     of great current industrial and academic interest.  This                        interest is due in large part to the recent recognition of                      the importance of polymer interphase behavior to a broad                        spectrum of technologies including rubber toughening,                           dispersion stability, polymer blends, adhesion, and multiplier                  films.  Many of these technologies employ block copolymers to                   accomplish this modification.  At present, however, there is                    little basis for the design or optimization of interfacial                      agents for specific applications.   The objective of the                        proposed research is to provide such a basis by carrying out                    a systematic study of the effects of block copolymer                            composition, content, and architecture on their efficacy as                     interfacial agents for immiscible homopolymer blends.  The                      success of this proposition is contingent upon the ability to                   synthesize well characterized block copolymers, to quantita-                    tively ascertain their interfacial activity, and to compare                     these results with thermodynamic theories of interfacial                        properties.  The project will benefit from the complementary                    expertise of the US and French groups.  The French team has                     extensive experience in the anionic synthesis of well-                          characterized block copolymers, as well as in their structure-                  property relationships.  The U.S. team brings expertise in the                  structural characterization of block copolymers by scattering                   techniques, and in the measurement of polymer-polymer                           interfacial tension.  The latter technique has already proven                   successful for the study of interfacial activity of block                       copolymers.  When coupled with the specimens prepared by the                    French team, these experiments will provide a basis of                          fundamental knowledge pertaining to interfacial activity of                     block copolymers and its relationship to molecular architec-                    ture.",
