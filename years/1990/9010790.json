 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the extension of methods recently developed by           the principal investigator in the area of narrowband passive array              processing.  The approach involves using real steering vectors rather           than traditional complex steering vectors which will allow the                  processing of more signals than was previously possible and/or the              processing of signals in the presence of arbitrary noise amplitude              distributions.                                                                                                                                                  The first phase of research involves the extension of these methods to          wideband passive array processing; thus, taking advantage of the entire         frequency support of signals which may not necessarily be narrowband.           The second phase will be the development of efficient methods to                implement both the narrowband and the wideband algorithms and,                  consequently, making these methods practical from a computational               viewpoint.  This phase will rely on methods in numerical nonlinear              optimization theory which have not previously been applied to array             processing problems.",
