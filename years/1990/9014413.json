 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is designed to evaluate how community                        interactions (predation, competition) produce changes in                        ecosystem dynamics during a series of whole-lake food web                       manipulations.  The work proposed capitalizes on a program of                   fish stocking manipulations funded by an LTREB grant from the                   National Science Foundation, as well as on the long-term record                 of data collection at this site.                                                     Detailed study of resource-and predator-relations of the                   dominant components of the food web will allow the investigators                                                                                                the mechanisms responsible for changes in each tropic level and                 ultimately in the ecosystem itself.  Fish populations will be                   monitored by acoustics and video observation, as well as by more                                                                                                conventional fisheries techniques, and changes in abundances,                   growth, diets, recruitment, and degree of plankivory evaluated as                                                                                               major changes in external fish stocking intensity are imposed.                  Changes in zooplankton dynamics (especially of Daphnia) will also                                                                                               be examines using techniques of zooplankton population biology                  (egg ratios, estimates of birth and death rates) as well as                     physiological measures of food status (lipid content).
