The REU program           will be conducted in conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer           Research Program, sponsored by the Texas engineering Experiment                 Station for the past eight years, and the Minority Engineering                  Program.  Students for the REU Program will be selected from                    institutions that have predominantly minority enrollments including             the University of Texas at El Paso, University of Texas at San                  Antonio, Pan American University, University of Puerto Rico, and                Prairie View A&m as well as Texas A&M, with as least half from other            institutions.  Individual research projects will be undertaken by the           undergraduate students in conjunction with on-going research programs,          and regular activities.  Research projects have included high                   turbulence intensities on flow, fabrication of thin, silicon                    membranes, simulation for electronic manufacturing, and inductive               coupled coils for spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging.",
