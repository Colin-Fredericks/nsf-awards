 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project develops a theory of vertical integration in                        multilateral settings.  This is an important contribution because               nearly all of the recent work on transaction cost/incomplete                    contracting motivations for vertical integration makes the                      unrealistic assumption of bilateral trading relations in which a                single seller produces an input for use by a single buyer.  In                  most settings, economies of scale and/or scope dictate that                     supply or purchasing relations by multilateral.  This project                   also seeks to shed light on the mechanism by which firms in                     highly concentrated industries maintain supracompetitive prices                 and, in particular, on the relevance of dynamic models of                       repeated interaction for understanding the determination of                     prices in these markets.  It does this by analyzing a particular                natural experiment involving the lead-based antiknock additive                  industry.                                                                                                                                                       There is a vast literature concerning the determination of the                  size and scope of a firm's activities.  Particular attention has                focused on theories of integration based on transactions costs in               which the motivations for integration are tied to the problems                  arising from an inability to write comprehensive contracts.                     There appears to be an emerging theoretical and empirical                       consensus that such theories offer the most promising path for                  understanding and predicting a firm's integration decisions.                    This is why it is so important to improve the realism of the                    theories of vertical integration.  An intermediate goods                        manufacturer will supply inputs to a number of firms and/or                     industries and a wholesaler or retailer will often handle                       numerous products, but existing theories assume a single                        supplier produces an input for use by a single buyer.  This                     project corrects this flaw.                                                                                                                                     The empirical research is also important.  The determination of                 prices in oligopolistic industries where firms recognize their                  mutual interdependence is one of the central issues in industrial               organization.  A great deal of theoretical attention in recent                  years has focused on developing dynamic models in which firms                   sustain supracompetitive prices because of the concern that                     deviant behavior will result in the loss of collusive profits in                the future.  This project studies domestic lead-based antiknock                 additive industry because the prospect of future profits                        virtually disappeared on October 1979 due to the implementation                 of Environmental Protection Agency regulations.  In the dynamic                 models of oligopolistic pricing, this sort of fall in demand                    would be expected to create downward pressure on prices prior to                the actual fall in demand.",
