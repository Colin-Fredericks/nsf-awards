 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the work described in this proposal is to test                       directly the hypothesis that an endogenous electrical field in                  the chick embryo acts to guide lumbo-sacral neural crest cells                  to their targets in the hind gut. Dr. Robinson will do this by                  manipulating the endogenous field during the period of crest cell               migration. This field, which is the result of a large current                   that leaves the posterior intestinal portal, will be altered by                 shunting the current which generates it through wounds created in               the integument, or by voltage clamping the embryonic                            transepithelial potential, thus eliminating or reversing the                    endogenous field. The fluorescent dye DiI will be used to trace                 the neural crest cells during their migration. Dr. Robinson will                also do a light and electron microscopy study of tail gut                       degeneration in the chick in order to establish that this process               is responsible for the currents he detects leaving the posterior                intestinal portal. The in vitro effects of an applied electrical                field on the proposed endogenous field target cells will also be                examined. He will extend his vibrating probe observations to                    mouse embryos, particularly some of the mutants that are                        available, in order to determine if changes in any of the                       endogenous current parameters are indicative of specific                        abnormalities. The information gained from these experiments will               add substantially to our knowledge of how migratory cells are                   guided during development.",
