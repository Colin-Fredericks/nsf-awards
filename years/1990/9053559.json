 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, \"Inservice Teacher Training in Environmental Education\",          aims at training 400 Wisconsin K-12 educators to teach environmental            education (EE) in all areas of the school curriculum.  It also aims at          increasing the amount of instructional time spent teaching EE by these          400 teachers to a minimum of 5 hours per week.  This unique model of            inservice teacher training is developed and implemented as a pilot              program by the College of Natural Resources.  The project duration is 12        months, and the cost sharing is 27 percent of the amount requested from         National Science Foundation.                                                                                                                                    The teacher preparation provides instruction on the goals of EE;                provides opportunities to acquire and apply the knowledge, skills and           attitudes inherent in EE; provides participatory and practice-based             training in the methods as well as the content of EE instructional              materials; provides training in using the classroom and the school yard         as sites for EE; and provides motivation for teachers from all                  backgrounds and grade levels to teach EE.                                                                                                                       The teachers are selected from the 481 school districts and 2002 public         schools in the state of Wisconsin. Specific encouragement is given to           women, minorities, and disabled persons to participate. A series of four        courses are offered, starting in the summer of 1990, the second and             third in early 1991, and the fourth in the summer of 1991. Subsequently,        there will be teacher evaluation student evaluation, and material               dissemination throughout the state.",
