 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the study of ultrafast phenomena in high                  temperature superconducting thin films.  The Research Equipment Grant           will enable construction of an ultrafast electro-optic sampling system          to investigate the generation of nonequilibrium carriers by ultrashort          laser pulses.  Preliminary laboratory results by the principal                  investigator indicate the presence of such effects have been observed.          Such effects should have important applications to ultrafast optical            switching, and to ultrafast electrical pulse generation and                     propagation studies.  These studies are also relevant to future opto-           electronic integrated circuits applications.  In the proposed                   experiments, high quality superconducting films as thin s 400 A are             generated by the process of plasma-assisted laser deposition on                 various dielectric substrates, and patterned into transmission line             structures.  Since no post-annealing is necessary in this sample                preparation technique, these lines are smooth with controllable grain           sizes.  Femtosecond laser pulses at various wavelengths are then used           to measure the temporal response of these patterned films.                      Wavelengths from 0.4-4.4 um will be used.  It is expected that the              ultimate response time should be less than 1 ps for the new oxide               superconductors.  Such studies are also of fundamental interest to the          understanding of nonequilibrium processes in high temperature 2-                dimension superconductors.  Other applications include ultrafast and            wideband detection of radiation and ultrafast optical signal                    processing.",
