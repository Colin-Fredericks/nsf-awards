 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                   Organometallic Chemistry Program, Alan H. Cowley of the                         University of Texas at Austin will investigate three areas of                   main group element chemistry: (a) elements in unusually low                     oxidation state, (b) elements with unusually low coordination                   number, and (c) polymeric materials incorporating main group                    elements. The first two areas are expected to generate new                      chemical compounds with unusual reactivities and properties.                    The polymers generated in the third project would likewise be                   new materials with interesting and potentially useful                           properties.                                                                                                                                                     New ligands will be developed that will have supplemental                       coordination capacity and be designed to stabilize main group                   elements in low oxidation state, such as phosphorus(+1),                        arsenic(+1), antimony(+1), bismuth(+1), gallium(+1) and                         aluminum(+1). In the second area, syntheses of analogues of                     transition metal alkylidenes and alkylidynes will be attempted                  with group 14 (for example, silicon and germanium) and 15 (for                  example, phosphorus and arsenic) elements replacing the multiply                bonded carbon to produce compounds with transition metal to                     main group element multiple bonds. The targeted transition                      metals to be employed are molybdenum, tungsten, rhenium, nio-                   bium, zirconium and hafnium. These compounds will then be ex-                   amined for reactivities similar to the transition metal                         alkylidenes and alkylidynes, which include polymerization                       reactions.",
