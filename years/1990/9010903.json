 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information Technology (IT) capital currently represents 7%                   oftotal capital stock in the U.S. and accounts for a                            rapidlygrowing share of capital expenditures, making it one of                  the mostimportant innovations of recent times.  Surprisingly,                   fewtheoretical or empirical analyses have focussed on the                       diffusionof IT and in particular, quantified its growth.  Given                 thesignificant role of IT as a capital input in every sector of                 theeconomy, it is important to analyze these growth trends.                       This project studies the demand for IT capital for the                        period1972.1987 at both the industry and the aggregate economy                  levels. While much of the literature refers to the growth of IT                 in thecontext of the diffusion of innovation and S.curve                        behavior, itis argued in this project that the declining costs of               computingwill have a significant impact on the pattern of                       diffusion.  Theresearcher develops economic models of the demand                for IT thatintegrate these two factors.  The models also examine                theinfluence of other factors, including the cost of labor                      andgeneral business conditions on the demand for IT.  The quality               ofthe models, and their form and parameters are determined                      throughan econometric analysis of data on the stocks and flows of               IT atthe industry and aggregate economy levels.  The research                   examinesthe extent to which the growth of IT stock can be                       explained bythe effects of the innovation diffusion versus the                  price effects. The Principal Investigator looks at the                          relationships between theaggregate and the industry demand                      functions as well as inter.industry differences.",
