 "awd_abstract_narration": "The science of plant breeding, 1900 - 1975, has produced new crop               varieties capable of remarkably higher yields than were older                   cultivars.  By 1975, it was possible to say that the new varieties,             plus other changes in agricultural technology, had been a key                   ingredient in a massive change in human social life:  globally, we              became a species that lives primarily in urban areas with only a                minority of people left in production agriculture in rural areas.               This project involves the preparation of a book-length treatment                of the history of plant breeding from a comparative, cross-cultural             perspective.  The treatment will include the building of the                    conceptual foundations of the science plus the interactions of the              science with its political and economic context.  A central thesis              of this book is that issues of war and national security shaped the             context in which plant breeders worked.  Events in World War I set              the stage for the growth of plant breeding as a national asset.                 World War II, the demise of colonial empires, and the cold war                  provided an enormous boost to plant breeding as nations sought                  increased security through enhanced food production.  In the                    contemporary world, it is impossible to understand the treatment                of plant breeding by political institutions without discussing the              strategic implications of the science.  Complexities of the                     agricultural industry make it essential to focus the research and               resulting manuscript on a sub-set of plant breeding issues:  wheat              breeding in Britain, India, Mexico, and the United States provides              a case study to advance this thesis.  Evidence comes from archival              sources supplemented by secondary literature and oral interviews.                                                                                               This research has a unique and timely focus; its results will be                useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications and               track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional                   support is adequate; the budget request is modest.  This award is               highly recommended.",
