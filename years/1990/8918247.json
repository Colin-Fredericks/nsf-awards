 "awd_abstract_narration": "The awe with which most biologists view the organismal                     diversity of nature has contributed to several generations of                   study, yet biologists still do not understand in detail the                     evolutionary processes that generate this biological diversity.                 Theoretical models of speciation and diversification have been                  proposed, but few of these theories have been tested rigorously                 with empirical data from specific groups of plants and animals.                 The lack of experimental studies of speciation reflects in part                 an inability to recognize actively speciating groups, that is,                  those groups currently undergoing the processes of divergence and               reproductive isolation.  However, recent advances in the field of               molecular biology and in phylogenetic data analysis have made                   possible the identification of such actively speciating groups.                      Dr. Pamela Soltis of Washington State University proposes to               use these new methodologies (restriction site analysis of                       chloroplast DNA and cladistic methods of phylogenetic analysis)                 to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the 70-80 species of                 Lomatium, a genus of plants from western North America.  Lomatium               was chosen for study because it appears to be an actively                       speciating genus, with a large number of morphologically discrete               species occupying very restricted geographic ranges.                            Furthermore, several models of speciation seem to fit general                   observations on Lomatium: geographical divergence, hybrid                       speciation, and polyploidy (chromosome doubling).  The proposed                 research will provide a robust hypothesis of evolutionary                       relationships among all the species in the genus and will allow                 the identification of smaller subgroups of species appropriate                  for future experimental analyses of speciational processes and                  the biology of endemic (narrowly distributed) species.",
