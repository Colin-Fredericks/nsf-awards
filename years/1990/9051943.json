 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the establishment of a computer                  laboratory in order to improve the manner in which mathematics is               taught by using the computer in a fundamental way to motivate                   concepts and involve students in the process of mathematics                     research and discovery.  It is being funded under the                           Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                 has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                  instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                   mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory                Improvement Program provides matching support for the                           instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                            instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                        In particular, the main objective of this project is to                    engage students' interest in mathematics by using the computer to               motivate concepts and to involve students as active participants.               The major focus of this project will be a new course in Chaotic                 Dynamical Systems which: (1) is designed to appeal to a wide                    spectrum of students interested in science and mathematics, (2)                 is seen as the precursor of a first-year course that would                      combine dynamical systems and calculus, and (3) would bring to a                much broader audience the excitement and beauty of research-level               mathematics.  Other courses in which the computer is already used               would also be affected by the acquisition of the new equipment.                 The long-range goal is the improvement of the participation of                  women and minorities in the scientific workforce, as well as the                role women play in our society as mathematically and                            scientifically literate citizens.",
