 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to establish the physical and chemical                       principles which underlie in the kinetics of the phase transition               of polymer gels; phase transitions are a phenomenon universally                 found in gels where they reversibly swell or shrink in volume by                as large as 1000 times in response to changes in temperature,                   solvent compositions, pH, ionic strength, electric field, or                    light.  The research will examine the time course of the shape,                 local network density and local strain of gels of various sizes                 and chemical composition in regards to the kinetic processes of a               phase transition.  Kinetics of a swelling or shrinking process of               a gel with respect to a small change in volume have already been                established; it was uniquely characterized by the collective                    diffusion coefficient of polymer network.  Whether or not a                     similar theory applies to the kinetics of phase transition where                the gel volume changes by 3 orders of magnitude is unknown.  To                 examine such a hypothesis and establish the principles of                       kinetics of phase transition, these viscoelastic quantities will                be independently determined within the entire phase diagram of                  gels.  Friction coefficient and shear modulus will be determined                by microscopic methods.  Dynamic light scattering and                           fluorescence photobleaching recovery spectroscopy will be used.                 The mechanism of formation and evolution of patterns that appear                in gels undergoing a phase transition will be elucidated so as to               formulate the equation of motion that govern the kinetic                        processes of gels.  Finally, it is hoped to clarify the origin of               structural inhomogeneities within gels which influence                          substantially their mechanical, optical, and viscoelastic                       properties.",
