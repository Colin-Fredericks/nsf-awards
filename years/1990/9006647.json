 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast majority of all plants have seeds modified for                    dispersal, movement away from the parent plant.  The pattern of                 seed dispersal has the potential to affect both the survival of                 individual plants and characteristics of plant populations.                     Since plants are immobile once rooted, the quality of the site                  into which a plant is dispersed as a seed has a major effect on                 its survival.  Patterns of seed dispersal also affect the spatial               arrangement of genetically related individuals.  This spatial                   genetic structure has important consequences for the plant                      population.                                                                          The investigators wil document the effects of seed dispersal               on plant fate and population genetic structure by following the                 movement and subsequent survival of seeds in natural populations,               using the dispersal of seeds of the native wildflower, Trillium                 grandiflorum, by ants as a model system.  Seeds will be marked                  with a radio label that will allow them to be relocated after                   dispersal by ants or other animals.  The survival and growth of                 plants resulting from dispersed and undispersed seeds will be                   followed for 3 years.  The genetic identity of plants will be                   determined using electrophoresis.  In order to document the role                of dispersal in the development of spatial genetic structure, the               genetic structure of the study population will be determined at                 four stages of the plant life cycle:  undispersed seeds,                        dispersed seeds, seedlings, and adult plants.                                        The results of this study will be of a value to conservation               biologists  involved in the preservation or restoration of                      plants in their natural habitats.  An understanding of the                      effects of seed dispersal on plant survival is critical to such                 efforts.  This study will also explore the importance of seed                   dispersal by animals in the development of population genetic                   structure and in the maintenance of population genetic diversity,               two factors that may be important in the long-term conservation                 of viable populations.",
