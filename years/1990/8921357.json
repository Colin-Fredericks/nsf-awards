 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work addressed  issues of obvious importance to                    society : the measurement of post-school investments and their                  profitability, changes in investment volumes and profitability                  over time, the contribution of these investments to economic                    growth , the interrelation of these investments with                            technological change and the substitutability between schooling                 and post-schooling investments. The work will estimate the                      economy-wide investment in on-the-job training, including both                  the opportunity costs borne by workers and employer investments                 in training. These estimates will be based on two important                     microeconomic data sets - the Panel Survey on Income Dynamics                   and the Current Population Survey. The direct estimates obtained                from these data sets are to be compared to estimates of the same                costs based on wage profiles. They will also be used to verify                  the human capital interpretation of wage profiles. Another focus                of the work is on the responses of this type of human capital                   formation to technological changes and the contribution made                    thereby to economic growth.",
