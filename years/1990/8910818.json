 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Dr. Richard D. Schlichting of the University            of Arizona to conduct collaborative research for seven months with              Dr. Takuya Katayama of the Tokyo Institute of Technology.  They will            investigate the high-level design processes that are involved in                fault-tolerant distributed systems, and will attempt to begin                   development of a programming environment to facilitate implementation           and testing of software for such systems.                                                                                                                       Problems of particular interest in distributed systems include that             of the construction of distributed mixed-language programming; the              development of a high-level approach to handling failure in mixed               programming languages; and the validation of fault-tolerant programs.           These problems, among others, will be addressed in this research.               The Japanese collaborator's expertise in language translation,                  software design, and programming environments will strongly complement          the U.S. Principal Investigator's expertise in distributed and fault-           tolerant computing, and ongoing projects in distributed computing at            the Tokyo Institute of Technology will synergistically contribute to            the success of this work.",
