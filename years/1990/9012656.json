Understanding how these molecules may normally function as                      potential neurotransmitters requires that we know what controls                 their release, where they act, and what effects they have. We                   have made substantial progress in answering these questions for                 endogenous opioid peptides in the hippocampus by characterizing                 the molecular forms of the peptides present, the distribution                   of the receptor sites, and the pharmacological effects of                       opioids in each of the principal regions of the hippocampus.                    Further work is required to define the effects of endogenously-                 released opioids on hippocampal neurons. Information obtained                   from this study will allow us to construct a detailed                           description of the role of endogenous opioid peptides in the                    hippocampal neural network and provide a model of neuropeptide                  action in normal hippocampal physiology associated with                         learning and memory processes.",
