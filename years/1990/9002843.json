 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transoceanic undersea telecommunications cables are becoming                    available for re-use by the scientific community.  These                        cables cross vast regions of the floors of the Atlantic and                     Pacific oceans.  They traverse nearly every type of                             geomorphic province, including deep ocean basins, ridge                         systems, oceanic trenches and continental margins; and they                     underlie most features of ocean dynamics including western                      and eastern boundary currents, central gyres and areas of                       fronts and eddies.                                                                                                                                              The workshop will 1) assess scientific needs, opportunities                     and interest for re-use of cables soon to be abandoned by                       international telephone companies, 2) develop initial                           technical models for adding scientific instrumentation, 3)                      examine ways to manage facilities, experiments and data, and                    4) determine cost estimates for scientific use of these                         systems.                                                                                                                                                        The workshop is being held in January 1990 on Oahu in Hawaii                    where primary shore-based cable facilities for the Pacific                      are located.  The University of Hawaii will provide local                       support.  A seven member science steering committee will                        ensure balanced representation of the approximately 30                                                                                                          participants anticipated.  They will also prepare and publish                                                                                                   a full report of the workshop, with conclusions, working                                                                                                        papers and recommendations for science planning included, by                                                                                                    mid-1990.",
