 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to understand some of the                   principles of chromosome function that relate to the control of                 gene expression, i.e., transcription.  Specific area to be                      addressed concern (i) the mechanism and evolution of dosage                     compensation in Drosophila (ii) the human fragile-X chromosome:                 effect of imprinting, and erasure of the imprint, and                           transcription of genes at that fragile site, Xq27.3.  The                       methods to be employed include genetic, molecular, somatic cell                 genetic, cytogenetic, and pedigree analysis.                                                                                                                    The significance of this proposed research is expected to be an                 increased understanding of chromosome function as it relates to                 transcriptional control.  Understanding is expected to be                       enhanced by the use of chromosome from two of the best-                         understood organisms-Drosophila and humans.  The basic                          biological principles discovered in fruit flies sometimes have                  direct application to human genetic biology; the converse is                    also true.  This proposal gives two specific examples of this                   relationship between research in Drosophila and humans in which                 mutations that lead to the fragile-X syndrome, and Huntington's                 disease, provide a basis for renewed investigation in Drosophila                of chromosome imprinting and dominant position-effect                           variegation.",
