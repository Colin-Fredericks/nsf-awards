This project will                analyze the job histories of about 11,000 persons listed in 27                  consecutive years of the annual listing \"Guide to Departments of                Anthropology\".  The project will link individuals in successive                 years to study their professional careers within these academic                 departments (until recently the main source of professional                     employment for anthropologists).  Hypotheses to be tested involve               the tentative finding that male and female appointment and                      promotion rates converge over historical time, and that the                     differences between male and female promotion rates diminish as                 persons advance to higher ranks.                                                                                                                                This research has implications for the general job market and                   women's labor force participation.  The narrowness of the                       investigation within one discipline will allow control over key                 variables such as prestige of degree-granting and hiring                        departments, the variation within subdisciplines, and labor flows               within a single discipline.  The data base will be the foundation               for future studies which link other data (on productivity,                      salary) to these.",
