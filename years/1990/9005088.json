 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI will investigate the animal sediment relations and                      biogenic sedimentary structures of palagic carbonate systems in                 both shelf-sea and deep-sea settings.  Emphasis will be on                      interpreting the environmentally controlled trace fossil                        associations, ichnofabrics (modes of occurrence, preservation,                  deformation and juxtaposition of trace fossils) and paleoethology               (fossilized evidence of animal behavior) preserved in pelagic                   deposits in New Zealand and Denmark.  Palagic sediment is ideal                 for such studies, because (a) bioturbation rates typically far                  exceed depositional rates, (b) pelagic ooze occurs in regimes far               removed from direct perturbations of continental sediment influx,               and (c) the open-water setting allows for global comparisons and                synthesis.                                                                           Similarities and differences of ichnofabric, ichnofacies and               particular ethologic types of trace fossils will be documented in               pelagic limestone and chalk deposited in mid-latitude boreal seas               of the Southern and Northern Hemispheres during Late Cretaceous                 and Early Tertiary time.  The work will focus on the                            Maastrichtian-Oligocene Amuri Limestone on the South Island of                  New Zealand and Maastrichtian-Paleocene chalk in Denmark.  In                   addition, DSDP/ODP and commercial drill cores of deep-sea                       carbonate sections from nearby sites in the southwestern Pacific                and northeastern Atlantic will be examined.  This ichnologic                    research will provide a detailed picture of organism-substrate                  interrelationships in ancient pelagic ooze habitats, and it also                will allow construction of a global picture of endobenthic                      communities in non-tropical, mid-latitude, epicratonic sea-bottom               environments.",
