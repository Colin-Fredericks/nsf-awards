 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design, analyze, implement and test              several parallel methods for solving the nonlinear block bordered               equations arising in VLSI circuit simulation on parallel computers.             The focus will be on three important problem areas: 1) solving large            block bordered systems of nonlinear equations for a VLSI circuit                simulation, 2) VLSI circuit partitioning problem, efficiently mapping           a circuit network to a parallel computer system; 3) load balancing              problems on a distributed system, to balance the numerical computation          load for circuit simulation among the processors in a parallel                  computer.  The nonlinear block bordered equation is also one of the             most common types of large scale systems of nonlinear equations in              science and engineering applications.                                                                                                                           Effort will be devoted to develop parallel explicit, implicit, and              iterative methods for solving the block bordered nonlinear systems of           equations, including convergence analysis, perturbation methods for             singular or nearly singular block bordered systems, applications of             secant method, and the implementations of the methods on different              types of parallel computers.  Efficient partitioning methods will be            investigated in order to speed up the convergence rate of the                   nonlinear block bordered systems of equations, and to balance the               parallel load distribution statically.  The dynamic load balancing is           one of the most important issues for parallel computation.                      A load balancing scheduler will be developed on a parallel system to            improve the computation efficiency for solving the block bordered               equations in the circuit simulation.                                                                                                                            The design method is motivated by the use of parallel computers, and            the implementation and testing will be on parallel computers.                   The aim is, however, to discover new methods that efficiently solve             the numerical problems in VLSI circuit simulation on a parallel                 computer.",
