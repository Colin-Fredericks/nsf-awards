 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hudson Valley Community College will collaborate in this model                  project with two N.Y. State organizations:  Commission for the                  Blind and Visually Handicapped;  Office of Vocational & Educational             Services; and with Troy Resource Center for Independent Living,                 Capital District Center for Independence, and the IBM Corporation.              The goal of this model project is to develop a career access ladder             in science, engineering and technologies for individuals with                   disabilities.  Several innovations characterize the project,                    including an alternative, short term approach to academic                       programming, a supportive academic environment, a pre-employment                training program, and computer networking of academic resources.                The program has support form the college, IBM, and state and local              agencies.  It will build upon successful intervention projects,                 with an incremental approach to specific needs, i.e. a motivational             phase, followed by several training levels or steps.  The training              program will feature a curriculum designed by the Business Advisory             Council, with job readiness skills component to ensure effective                transition from training to the work environment.  The                          identification of needs and deliverables uniquely characterizes                 project.",
