 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will facilitate the study by a               graduate student in anthropology of illegal Garifuna immigrants                 who have settled in Los Angeles (from Belize).  The project will                test a theory of \"weak social ties\" in the personal network of                  immigrant job seekers, comparing the networks of women and men.                 A study of the originating village in Belize will examine the                   \"push\" factors in this migration.  Methods include structured                   interviews, household censuses, and participant observation.                                                                                                    This research is important because illegal migration is an                      important fact of social and economic life in the US today.                     Increased understanding of the factors involved in migration and                in job searches in the US can help policy makers deal with the                  problems.",
