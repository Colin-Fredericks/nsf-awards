 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for a Research Planning Grant expands previous                    research on safety-monitoring systems in the air traffic sector to              other sectors.  The main purpose of the planning grant is to                    conduct preliminary research to determine which monitoring systems              will be studied in depth as part of the planned research project.               The research will examine the ways organizations collect                        information about and learn from near accidents.                                                                                                                During the planning period, the principal investigator will examine             archival data and conduct interviews.  Research sites include                   systems for monitoring medical instruments, the production of                   nuclear energy, and the coordination of telephone operations.  The              proposed research will contribute to the study of information                   acquisition and processing in organizations, as well as to analysis             of organizational learning.",
