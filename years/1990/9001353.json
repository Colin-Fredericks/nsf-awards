Gonzalez of the                    University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in collaboration with                  Professor Ricardo Gomez of the Metropolitan University of Mexico                at Iztapalapa.                                                                                                                                                  Studies recently completed suggest that metal-precursor-support                 interactions are important in determining the resulting surface                 composition of supported multimetallic catalysts.  In particular,               the presence of a mobile surface metal-precursor results in the                 surface enrichment of that metal in the resulting bimetallic                    catalyst.  The investigators aim to identify the structure of                   these precursor-surface complexes using diffuse U.V. reflectance                spectroscopy.  The strength of the metal-support interactions                   will be measured through the use of quantitative differential                   scanning calorimetry and the elemental composition of the resulting             bimetallic particles will be obtained through the use of dispersive             x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS).  EDXS will also be used to study                     interparticle metal phase relationships.                                                                                                                        The proposed research will be carried out simultaneously at the                 University of Illinois at Chicago and the Metropolitan University               of Mexico at Iztapalapa.  The in-situ diffuse U.V. reflectance                  studies, the microcalorimetric DSC studies and the catalyst charac-             terization studies, including the surface composition measurements,             will be carried out at the University of Illinois.  The catalytic               probe reactions and major portion of the EDXS studies will be                   performed in Mexico.",
