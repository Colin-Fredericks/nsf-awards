 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several fungi of the ascomycete family Clavicipitaceae have been                implicated as causative agents in the poisoning of grazing                      animals, where the fungi live within the tissues of grass plants                and produce alkaloids toxic to animals but not to the plant.  Our               knowledge of these fungi and of their growth on and within                      various host plants is meager, however.  Drs. James White and                   Gareth Morgan-Jones of Auburn University are studying North                     American members of this group of fungi, to improve delimitation                of the species, identify normal host plants, analyze the mode of                infection by the fungus, and determine the life cycles of the                   fungus through its various spore-producing stages.                                   New characters from biochemical analyses of fungal pigments                and from electrophoresis of fungal proteins are being sought, to                add to traditional morphological characters in order to                         circumscribe a meaningful species concept for this group of                     fungi.  Their classification is complicated by the fact that                    asexual, spore-forming stages, which are commonly collected in                  nature, have their own system of scientific names, independent                  of the sexually reproducing forms, which are often transitory,                  poorly collected, and poorly known.  Biochemical features shared                in common will help in linking the two stages of the life cycle,                and make possible the comparison of related species.  In turn,                  such insight will help determine whether taxonomically related                  fungi infect related groups of host plants or whether disparate                 fungal groups have evolved the ability to live inside host                      grasses.",
