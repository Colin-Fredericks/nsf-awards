 "awd_abstract_narration": "Root growth is frequently less inhibited than shoot growth in water             stressed plants.  Despite the importance of this response to plant              performance under drought, the physiological mechanisms regulating the          differential growth sensitivities are not known and little studied.             This proposal will examine in detail the role of the plant hormone              abscisic acid (ABA) in the growth responses of maize to water stress.           Preliminary results suggest that naturally-occurring ABA maintains root         growth while inhibiting shoot growth of water stressed maize seedlings.         Additionally, the PI has shown that large differences in the growth             response to water stress exist among closely related tissues within the         growing zone of the root and shoot.  In the proposed work, internal             levels of ABA will be manipulated in the growing zones of roots and             shoots using a mutant deficient in ABA synthesis as well an inhibitor           of ABA synthesis.  High resolution techniques will be used to determine         growth rate, ABA levels and molecular indicators of tissue response to          ABA in one-millimeter sections of the growing zones.  Results will              greatly assist in determining the biochemical and biophysical processes         regulated by the hormone and will set the stage for breeding strategies         to improve maize performance drought-prone environments.",
