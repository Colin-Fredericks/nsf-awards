 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning in 1928, state, federal, and tribal agencies in                       northern Arizona began entrusting archaeological collections                    generated from lands under their jurisdiction to the Museum of                  Northern Arizona's care.  The result is an body of data on both                 the prehistory and history of the Colorado Plateau region.                      Materials include almost 200,000 catalogued artifacts - almost                  all from provenienced contexts with accompanying documentation                  including culture, site, and time period.  Added to this are bulk               collections which also are accompanied by excavation information.               An extensive ethnographic collection which focusses primarily on                Hopi and Navaho materials numbers approximately 10,000 pieces.                  Both archaeological and ethnographic collections are of great                   research value and subject to intensive use.  However, the                      crucial documentation which accompanies them is not well                        organized.  It is deteriorating and because of its volume,                      difficult to organize and access.  With NSF support the Museum                  will computerize this material in order to cross reference                      individual records and provide greater accessibility.  This will                minimize direct use and, therefore, the deterioration of the                    paper records.  Dr. Wilcox and colleagues will purchase a                       Questor-Argus system which is specifically designed for museums                 collection management.                                                                                                                                          This project is important because it will prevent the                           deterioration of significant scientific materials, many acquired                with federal funds.  It will increase the access of the Museum's                anthropological collections to researchers who wish to use them.                These materials are of importance not only to archaeologists and                ethnographers but also to local Native American groups interested               in their own traditions.",
