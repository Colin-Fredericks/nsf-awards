 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of what we learn about human sensory processing comes  from                experiments that use the approach known as psychophysics, in                    which carefully quantified stimulus parameters are used to obtain               highly reproducible, quantifiable responses.  Such tests can                    include, for example, threshold measurements in which a subject                 responds by telling whether or not a particular stimulus is                     perceived.  Much of what we learn about how the cells of the                    brain process information comes from animal experiments, in which               quantified stimuli produce recordable neural activity that can be               measured in a variety of ways.  Recently it has become clear that               both approaches can be used on some of the same sensory issues.                                                                                                 This conference has the specific intent of bringing together                    vision researchers using both approaches, to address recent                     successes in relating physiological and psychophysical results                  from primate and human work, and to stimulate new                               interdisciplinary and cooperative research in vision among the                  international community.  The publication from the conference                   will likely have impact on sensory scientists in general, in                    addition to its value to visual neuroscience and psychology.",
