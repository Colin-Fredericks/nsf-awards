 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous MCS, magnetic and gravity surveys have concentrated                    on determining fundamental structural features of the US East                   Coast continental margin.  Unfortunately, firm constraints on                   the nature of rifting, tectonic subsidence, thinning and early                  volcanism have all been hampered by the difficulty of imaging                   the deepest \"rift-stage\" crust that underlies several margin-                   parallel basins.  A recent MCS program profiled the Carolina                    Trough, and 8 OBHs were deployed along two margin-perpendicular                 lines. Drs. Holbrook and Purdy have begun processing these                      data.  The present award will allow them to continue full                       wavefield imaging and 2D ray trace modeling that will improve                   velocity structure and imaging of the vertical-incidence MCS                    profiles.  In addition, support is provided to prepare for an                   additional series of OBH deployments along a similar margin                     transect offshore Chesapeake Bay.  This is tentatively                          scheduled for the Spring or Summer of 1990.  Specific goals of                  both experiments are to determine Moho geometry, basement                       depths, and various features of the intervening rift-stage                      crust.  Examples of the latter include along-strike variations                  in thickness, width, and velocity of rift-stage crust, as well                  as internal structure, reflection character, and nature of the                  lateral boundaries with \"normal\" continental and oceanic crust.",
