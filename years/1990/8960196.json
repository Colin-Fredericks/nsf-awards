 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although methanol fueled diesels are an attractive means of                     meeting the 1991 diesel particulate standards, they are not                     yet practical because the ignition delay is too long under                      typical operating conditions.  On board production is the                       ignition enhancer dimethyl ether (DME) from methanol, followed                  by aspiration of the DME into the cylinder has been shown to                    reduce significantly the ignition delay.  However, no                           information is available on the mechanism by which DME                          concentration on ignition delay.                                                                                                                                Development of DME enhanced, methanol fueled compression                        ignition engines is best carried out with a fundamental                         understanding of the combustion process.  It is proposed to                     develop a mechanistic model of DME combustion, validate it                      against existing ignition delay data, and merge the DME model                   with existing models of methanol combustion.  The insights and                  predictions derived from the model will be used to guide                        experiments aimed first at determining the effect of DME                        concentration on ignition delay, and ultimately at determining                  the optimal strategies for DME enhancement of methanol                          combustion.",
