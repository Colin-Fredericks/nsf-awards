 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of this project are to conduct modeling                  of currently used retrofit systems using cable restrainer,                      extensive studies of their effects on the response of highway                   bridges to earthquake excitations and the investigation of                      possible improvements of their design so that structural                        damage to bridges will be minimized or eliminated in future                     earthquakes                                                                                                                                                     The analytical models that will be developed will be used to                    study the response of retrofitted bridges including the                         response of the Whitewater Overcrossing (Br. 56-57) to the                      recent Palm Springs earthquake.  The bridge was retrofitted                     but suffered some damage during the 1986 Palm Springs                           earthquake.  Representative cable-restrained structures that                    were excited by the Loma Prieta earthquake will also be                         analyzed.  The primary tasks will be the inclusion of retrofit                  mechanisms in recently developed models to represent the                        impact between the bridge deck and the abutments during                         earthquakes and the modification of program NEABS so that it                    can be used for the analysis of general type retrofitted                        bridges.                                                                                                                                                        This project is coordinated with the program of the California                  Department of Transportation (CALTRANS) and practically funded                  by the Nevada Department of Transportation.",
