The                             concept being investigated involves a process by which                          organic compounds are converted to volatile substances                          which are stripped from water solution and catalytically                        oxidized.  The temperature rise by release of the heat of                       combustion is proportional to the amount of organic matter                      originally present.                                                                                                                                             The proposal leading to this Phase I award was submitted                        in response to the Small Business Innovation Research                           Program Solicitation, NSF 89-30.  The project proposes to                       develop a concept that can be used to continuously monitor                      the organic content of water and wastewater from municipal                      and industrial sources in contrast to current methods that                      rely on costly instruments that require frequent                                maintenance and operation by highly skilled technicians                         for discrete samples.",
