 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done on this project focuses on questions arising               at the interface of geometry and mathematical analysis in                       Euclidean spaces.  The basis for the research lies within the                   geometric development of complex function theory, in that it                    emphasizes the group structure underlying analytic function                     theory and the infinitesimal behavior of such functions.  It was                their infinitesimal regularity that led to the notion of                        quasiconformal mappings in the 1930's.  Decades passed before an                intrinsic definition of these mappings was found which could be                 applied to mappings in higher dimensions.  This work is about                   those mappings and their underlying domains.                                          A quasiconformal mapping is a univalent mapping between two               domains which maps infinitesimal circles into infinitesimal                     ellipses whose major and minor axes have bounded (the                           dilatation) ratios.  An important question in the understanding                 of their structure concerns the decomposition of maps into                      iterates of maps with the same dilatation.  Those with no such                  decomposition would form a basis of irreducible maps.  From the                 geometric side, one would like to know how to determine when two                domains are equivalent under quasiconformal mappings.  Even when                one of the two domains is a ball, this question is very                         difficult.  The sufficient conditions given by Schoenflies type                 theorems and the necessary ones arising from local connectivity                 are very far apart.  Some progress has been made in three                       dimensions when one of the domains is a slit domain and the other               is a ball.                                                                           Other work, concentrating on planar problems, will be                      concerned with Kleinian groups.  This includes continuing work on               measuring the distance of elements from the identity in several                 natural metrics. When applied to generators of groups,                          information about the singular set can be obtained.  As this work               develops further, higher dimensional analogues will be studied.                 Work will also continue on discrete convergence groups, a class                 of transformation groups introduced several years ago which                     reflect many properties of Mobius groups (they are conjugate to                 such groups by quasiconformal maps).  Investigations into the                   fine structure of convergence groups will be conducted.",
