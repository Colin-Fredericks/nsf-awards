 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this research is to analyze the economic               impact of policies designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse                   gases.  As an illustration, a tax on fossil fuel combustion,                    based on the carbon content of each fuel, could be imposed in                   order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.  This would induce                    substitution of other inputs for fossil fuels and increase the                  relative utilization of fuels such as natural gas with a low                    carbon content.  To model the economic impact of restricting the                emissions of greenhouse gases, U.S. economic growth is simulated                with and without these restrictions.  The model is characterized                by three distinctive features:  (1) It is highly disaggregated                  with separate models of production for thirty-five industrial                   sectors.  (2) The behavioral equations of the model are estimated               econometrically from an extensive new data base constructed                     specifically for this purpose.  (3) The dynamics of the model are               based on intertemporal optimization by households and firms.                    This project is important because it will begin to give us a                    better understanding of the behavior of the U.S. economy in                     response to policies designed to limit the emissions of                         greenhouse gases.",
