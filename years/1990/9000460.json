 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Office of Network Technologies at the Georgia Institute of                Technology proposes the installation and operation NSFSNET Node                 at Georgia Tech.  The Office of Network Technologies has                        significant expertise in the management and operation of large                  scale multi-access networks utilizing the TCP/IP protocol suite.                                                                                                  SURAnet, which spans 13 states, has more nodes than any of the                other mid-level networks.  Partially because it has only 1 NSS it               suffers serious \"hopcount\" problems.  It has congestion problems                as well.  Because of it's location and it's proximity to                        telecommunications Points Of Presence (POP's), Georgia Tech                     strategically positioned to provide a second SURAnet NSS.                       Locating a second SURAnet NSS at Georgia Tech would allow SURAnet               to significantly reduce hopcounts between SURAnet nodes and would               almost double the bandwidth out of SURAnet into the Internet.                                                                                                     SURAnet supports several T1 lines between Georgia Tech and                    other SURAnet nodes.  In the event of a failure at the University               of Maryland, the Georgia Tech site could provide enough                         redundancy to temporarily service all SURAnet traffic.  Load                    balancing between the two NSS's can be accomplished by adjusting                routing metrics.                                                                                                                                                  SURAnet and Georgia Tech has developed satisfactory procedures                to insure coordination between the nodes at the University of                   Maryland and Georgia Tech.***//",
