 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive IIR filters can be useful in many signal processing and                communication applications.  However, a number of important issues              concerning their robust design needs to be resolved before they can be          widely used.  This research addresses some of those issues.  In                 particular, it deals with:  1) Exhaustive study of the properties of            signed adaptive IIR filters, with special emphasis on the development           of design tools and guidelines to ensure their robust performance.  2)          Design of adaptive IIR filters which are time varying.  Both slow and           fast time variations will be considered.  3) Development of formal              methodologies for designing error filters for a range of adaptive               algorithms.                                                                                                                                                     The resolution of the above issues will contribute to the basic                 understanding of issues linked to good adaptive filter performance and          lead to the development of design tools for a spectrum of applications.",
