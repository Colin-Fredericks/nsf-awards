 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade and a half, Tilman has developed a                    theory of competition based on the premise that the species                     withthe lowest equilibrium resource concentration (R*) will be                  the superior competitor.   Considerable controversy exists on the                                                                                                                                                                               validity of the R* concept.  Current experimental evidence is                   somewhat contradictory as to the validity of the R* concept, and                                                                                                                                                                                in particular, how generally it applies.  This research will                    evaluate the basic mechanism of competition and the applicability                                                                                                                                                                               of the R* concept.  Preliminary studies will determine the                      relationships between competitive success and various resource                                                                                                  use characteristics (including estimates of R*) for 10 species of                                                                                                                                                                               emergent marsh plants at low and high fertility levels.                              The project will also include the completion of on-going                   experiments on nutrient competition, salinity effects and                                                                                                       above/below ground partitioning of competition in 5 marsh                                                                                                       species.
