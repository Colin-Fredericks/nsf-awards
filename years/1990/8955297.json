 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vermont Elementary Science Project is based on the                          recommendations from the National Center for Improving                          Science Education's recent reports on assessment;  curriculum                   and technology; and teacher development in elementary                           science.  The project will develop a regional staff                             development and training model for improving elementary                         science education.  This model for instructional change will                    be developed through extensive work with existing state                         structures such as the Vermont State Education Department,                      the Vermont Science Teachers' Association, the Vermont Higher                   Education Consortium, Middlebury College and local school                       districts.  Teams of teachers and administrators from the                       selected school districts will be trained in the following                      areas:  science content (physical science) and teaching                         methods for \"hands-on-minds-on\"; ideas related to the                           conditions in schools which support science education and                       change; and implementation plans for the improvement of                         science teaching at the elementary school level.  The project                   will then provide continuous support for the changes                            necessary in order to implement and sustain good science                        teaching and good science programs in these districts.  The                     evaluation of the program will                                                  include addressing the issue of student change, and will be based               on the State's new assessment program which will involve the                    evaluation of the products produced for student portfolios.                     The cost sharing for the project will be 35% of the NSF portion.",
