 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study those factors that give rise to the               distribution of genetic variation within populations of tropical                trees.  A statistical technique, genealogical reconstruction will               utilize several genetic loci to identify the parents of seeds and               established seedlings.  Once the parents of these individuals                   have been identified, several questions concerning the                          development and maintenance of fine-scale genetic structure can                 be answered.  Dr. Hamrick will be able to measure the distance                  pollen moves and to determine whether the immigration of pollen                 plays a significant role in shaping the genetic composition of                  these populations.  He will also be able to measure seed                        dispersal distances and to determine which adult individuals are                effective in reproducing the next generation.                                        The importance of this research is its potential to provide                a better understanding of the mechanisms that play a role in the                reproductive biology of tropical tree species.  This information                could be used in the effective design and maintenance of                        conservation areas.  It could also be important for attempts to                 regenerate tropical forests after their destruction.  Finally,                  this research will provide basic information concerning the                     ecology and evolution of tropical tree communities.",
