 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the conduct of the National Science Foundation sponsored                 American Society of Mechanical Engineers Workshop on Mechanical                 Tolerancing (September 28 - October 2, 1988), it became evident                 that there was a need to determine the shortcomings and                         ambiguities of inspection systems that assess deviations of part                geometries according to current standards and practices of                      dimensioning and tolerancing.                                                                                                                                   A study will be conducted to examine the difference between the                 results of current sample measurement systems measuring                         workpieces dimensioned and toleranced to current geometric                      dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T) standards. The ambiguities                  found can be traced to the need for a mathematical foundation for               current standards. The final report will consist of a draft                     standard to be supplied to the National Science Foundation and                  the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Y14 Committee for                  approval as the American National Standard.",
