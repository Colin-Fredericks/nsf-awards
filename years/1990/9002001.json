 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in cell biology to                     be conducted by Paul Lazarow of Mt. Sinai School of Medicine                    in New York collaborating with Manuel Santos of the Catholic                    University in Santiago, Chile.  The research will involve the                   study of subcellular organelles, peroxisomes, that participate                  in lipid metabolism and cellular respiration.  The peroxisomal                  proteins seem to be formed from pre-existing organelles by                      synthesis on free ribosomes and imported into the organelle.                                                                                                    Recently a series of human genetic disorders involving                          peroxisomal functions has been described.  Some of these                        peroxisomal disorders are thought to be the consequence of a                    failure in the peroxisomal biogenetic mechanisms, in which                      the peroxisomal membrane plays an essential role.  Unfor-                       tunately, the human peroxisomal membrane has been poorly                        studied: its protein composition is largely unknown, there                      are not antibodies available against its proteins, that can                     be used to study some aspects of peroxisomal biogenesis.  This                  research will obtain a battery of polyclonal and monoclonal                     antibodies against the proteins of the human peroxisomal                        membrane, which can be used as reagents to evaluate the                         presence, abundance and subcellular localization of these                       peroxisomal proteins in fibroblasts derived from patients                       affected by disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis.  The                           information obtained in this project will contribute to the                     knowledge of the structure, composition and function of human                   peroxisomes and to knowledge of the mechanism of peroxisome                     biogenesis.  In addition, it will contribute to the under-                      standing of the role of peroxisome in genetic pathology.",
