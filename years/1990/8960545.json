 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sign language is the normal mode of communication for many                      deafand non-speaking individuals.  The problem with sign language               is that to communicate, all persons involved must understand sign               language and be in plain sight of each other.  A systems is                     needed that can encode sign language and convert it to the                      English language text that it represents, so that remote signers                and those not versed in sign language can communicate with each                 other.                                                                                                                                                          Digital Video Processing, Inc. will develop a sign language                     recognition and translation system to allow users versed in sign                language to more readily communicate.  The system will harness                  real-time motions and positions and encode this information.  A                 sign language recognizer will interpret the data and relate it to               a dictionary of segments (letter, words, etc.) and choose                       theappropriate segment.  The Phase I effort will address the                    significant problems and opportunities associated with encoding                 the inputs, extracting the input's information content, and                     recognizing and translating particular segments.  A complete                    hardware and software specification for the prototype systems                   will be detailed.  Also, proposed algorithms for real-time sign                 language recognition will be described, and the ability to                      recognize sign language given the social, behavioral, and                       geographic differences inherent in any form of communication                    will be ascertained.",
