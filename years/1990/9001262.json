 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many organisms possessing a haplodiploid genetic system                   are known to preferentially allocate maleness and femaleness to                 individual offspring in response to environmental conditions that                                                                                               differentially confer advantages to either sex. (A haplodiploid                 species is one in which individuals of one sex--usually                         males--are produced from unfertilized eggs, while fertilized eggs                                                                                               produce individuals of the opposite sex).  For instance,                        parasitic wasps will most likely oviposit a female (fertilized)                 egg in a relatively large high quality prey individual since the                                                                                                ovipositing female stands to gain more grandoffspring through the                                                                                               function of large, robust daughters than through the function of                                                                                                large sons.  In contrast, the female will probably gain more                    grandoffspring through the function of small sons than through                  small daughters and will thus most likely allocate male                         (unfertilized) eggs to small, low quality, hosts.                                                                                                                    Differential sex allocation of the form just described is                                                                                                  well-studied in the parasitic wasps.  However, the factors                                                                                                      affecting sex allocation in haplodiploid herbivores are much less                                                                                               understood, though these herbivores are very common and quite                                                                                                   often cause major economic damage (e.g., spider mites and                                                                                                       sawflies).  In addition, herbivory is probably a primitive state                                                                                                in many haplodiploid groups and an understanding of gender                                                                                                      control will allow a better understanding of the evolution of                                                                                                   herbivory. The proposed research will examine the relationship                                                                                                  between sex allocation  in haplodiploid herbivores and the                                                                                                      variable quality of host-plants encountered.
