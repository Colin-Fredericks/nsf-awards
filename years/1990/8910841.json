 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                      Joseph B. Lambert  from the Chemistry Department at                             Northwestern University will study \"New Organic Intermediates                   Containing Silicon or Tin\".  He will explore the interactions                   between the element and adjacent positive charge in order to                    study the phenomenon of hyperconjugation.  Efforts will be made                 to use silylenium ions to provide new methods for                               carbon-silicon and silicon-silicon bond formation and to serve                  as catalysts for polymerization reactions that may lead to new                  materials.                                                                                                                                                      Positively charged species containing silicon, tin, or other                    Main Group elements will be used to study hyperconjugation.                     Tin and lead will be used to study delocalization  of positive                  charge over many sigma bonds in order to prove a new mechanism                  called multiple stage hyperconjugation. The spatial dependence                  of hyperconjugation in vinyl and saturated systems will be                      studied.  New strategies will be devised for obtaining                          silylenium, germylenium, and phosphenium ions with greater                      ionicity and stability.  Silylenium ions will be used to                        provide new methods for carbon-silicon and silicon-silicon bond                 formation and to serve as catalysts for polymerization                          reactions that may lead to new materials.  The exceptional                      ability of tin to stabilize positive charge will be used to                     create new phenyl and vinyl cations.",
