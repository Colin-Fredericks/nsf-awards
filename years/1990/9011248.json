 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to carry out fundamental research in           complexity theory and logic, focusing on the formal status of the               P=? NP question.  This question involves hundreds of long-studied               computer decision problems, and asks whether they can be solved by              time-efficient methods, or not.  The first part of the project is to            develop a uniform foundation for \"structural\" complexity theory, one            which refines the techniques currently used to investigate polynomial           time.  A key idea for making progress is that many of these techniques          can be sharpened to study linear time computation, where results                analogous to \"P = NP\" are already known, and where basic properties             have simpler representations in formal logic.  Expected results are a           better classification of problems solvable in linear or \"nearly                 linear\" time, and a deeper understanding of the obstacles to answering          the major open questions for polynomial time.  The second part                  combines complexity theory with techniques developed by logicians for           analyzing certain specific formal systems, ones capable of modeling             much current work in theoretical computer science.  Several                     researchers have raised the possibility that \"current methods in                computer science\" may be incapable of resolving \"P =? NP\" and related           questions; this project seeks a definite answer in terms of these               formal systems.  A further goal is to develop those techniques which            these systems may lack, aided by recent evedence that some concrete             results essentially require \"abstract\" methods, and by advances in              computer-assisted theorem proving.",
