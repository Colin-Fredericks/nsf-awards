 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will apply interdisciplinary research methods to                public sector accountability issues.  Use of interdisciplinary                  methods will be enhanced through a joint association with the College           of Engineering and the Institute for Public Policy Studies.                     Public sector accountability and performance evaluation will be                 addressed by investigating the choice of accounting practices and the           nature and amount of auditing performed by state and local                      governments.  This will expand on the research in public sector                 decision.making by:  (1) conducting field studies to gain a greater             understanding of the organizational factors and conditions which                influence government accounting practices, budgetary allocations, and           auditing choice; (2) using the organizational theory literature and             insights from the field studies to contribute to the theory of                  accounting and auditing choice under conditions of uncertainty; and             (3) empirically testing the implications drawn from the organizational          theory literature.  Analogies will be drawn between this decision               setting and similar group decision scenarios that involve diverse               parties with conflicting goals.                                                   Dr. Carpenter will teach a research seminar in public                         sector accountability issues and a section of an engineering economy            course which considers theories of capital allocation in private and            public sector organizations during the second year.  Additionally, she          will work with the university's Minority Program Office to develop              strategies and programs to increase the number of minority                      females pursuing careers in the sciences.                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and                        engineers employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.          By encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a                   valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
