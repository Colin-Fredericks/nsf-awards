 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies, including important contributions by Dr.                   Meredith Blackwell of Louisiana State University, suggest that                  dispersal of fungal spores by insects and other arthropods is                   more common than previously thought.  With the ascomycetes                      studied by Blackwell, beetles (including pine bark beetles) and                 mites have been shown to be critical vectors of spore transport.                This information and new knowledge about the complete life                      histories of these fungi have led to new hypotheses about the                   evolutionary relationships of arthropod-associated fungi.                            Because morphological features have not always been helpful                in evaluating the taxonomic relationships and phylogeny of these                fungi, in large part because of their very small size, Blackwell                will incorporate data from molecular analyses of ribosomal gene                 sequences in her study of evolution.  Two general hypotheses                    about the evolution of these fungi will be investigated.  (l) The               perithecial ascomycetes associated with arthropods are not a                    single natural group but represent an assemblage of different                   evolutionary lines that have converged upon an \"insect-transport\"               system of spore dispersal.  (2) The evolution of fungi that are                 obligate parasites of arthropods has proceeded from ancestors                   that relied on insects for spore dispersal.  The study represents               a pioneering combination of traditional mycological techniques of               morphology and life-history investigation along with modern                     molecular methods of genome analysis.",
