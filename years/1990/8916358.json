 "awd_abstract_narration": "Replication of eucaryotic genomic DNA in a normal cell is cell                  cycle regulated.  Chromosomes are replicated only once in the S-                phase.  This important regulation system is not understood.  To                 understand this process it will be necessary to elucidate the                   mechanism of initiation of DNA replication at a single replicon.                Thus our long term goals are: (i) to understand the biochemical                 processes that govern the initiation of DNA replication at a                    eucaryotic chromosomal origin; (ii) to understand how initiation                of DNA replication at this origin is regulated on the biochemical               and genetic level.  To achieve these goals, it will be necessary                to identify, isolate and characterize both the proteins and genes               involved in initiation.                                                         Recently we defined a new origin of replication, ARS121, which we               found to be comprised of at least two major domains important for               the origin function (61).  Our working hypothesis is that one of                these domains is a replication regulatory domain (RRD) whereas                  the other is a replication essential domain (RED).  We found that               RRD is a target for binding of OBFl, which was identified,                      isolated and partially characterized in our laboratory (60,61).                 Based on our studies, we propose that RRD has a role in                         determining if and when RED wll be activated for initiation of                  DNA replication.  We propose that this regulation is accomplished               by the DNA binding proteins that recognize specifically DNA                     elements present in RRD.                                                        In this context, our short range specific aims are: I, to                       isolate, and overexpress the gene encoding OBF1; from yeast                     genomic libraries in   ll; II to characterize the biochemical                   properties of OBF1; III to isolate and characterize additional                  origin-binding proteins; IV, to isolate and overexpress the genes               encoding these proteins from yeast genomic libraries in   ll; V,                to test our basic hypothesis described above a direct examination               of the activation of ARS121 in vivo; VI, to isolate and                         characterize new origins of replication.                                        This project should provide new insights into the regulation of                 initiation of replication at a eucaryotic origin of replication                 and will provide the tools necessary for reconstructing in the                  future a protein-DNA complex at the origin for the studies of the               mechanism of initiation of DNA replication in vitro.",
