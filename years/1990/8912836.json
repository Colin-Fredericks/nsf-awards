 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical processing systems are inherently non-linear.  These                   systems include units such as polymerization reactors, high                     purity distillation columns, etc.  Control schemes presently                    in use are designed by obtaining an approximate linear model,                   valid around an operating steady state, and applying linear                     control techniques.  For processes that do not operate around                   a steady state, for example batch processes, approximate                        linearization along a nominal time-varying path results in a                    linear system with time-varying parameter are used.  With                       increasing demand for high product quality (for high value                      added chemicals, for example), increasing energy costs and                      enviromental concerns, and, decreasing cost of implementing                     advanced control systems (with more sophisticated lower cost                    computers), the use of complex nonlinear control systems is                     becoming viable.                                                                                                                                                The goal of this research project is to develop a new method                    for analyzing the behavior of nonlinear processes and to                        synthesize stable robust nonlinear control schemes for such                     systems.  Specifically the PI's focus is to:                                    1.  Develop a theoretical framework so that the properties and                  underlying structure of a nonlinear system become clear and                     well understood.  In this direction, results from differential                  geometric systems theory will be revisited from an engineering                  viewpoint and solutions to other theoretical problems will be                   pursued.                                                                        2.  Synthesize general control algorithms.                                      3.  Develop software tools so that the implementation of the                    above algorithms becomes straightforward.                                       4.  Experimentally apply the resultant algorithm to a                           polymerization reactor and thus evaluate the performance of                     the control schemes.",
