 "awd_abstract_narration": "The United States continues to be a multiracial and multiethnic                 society, standing out among industrial societies in the magnitude               of continuing waves of immigration and in the depth of concern                  over social relations among ethnic and racial groups.  In a                     pattern at variance with the past, racial and ethnic minorities                 are increasingly found in the suburbs of metropolitan areas,                    rather than their central cities.  This project addresses the                   significance of this trend by studying the suburbanization                      patterns for a wide range of racial/ethnic groups in five major                 metropolitan areas.                                                                                                                                             The study goes well beyond past research on suburbanization by                  focusing on differences among the suburban places to which                      different groups gain access.  It also examines differences                     within major racial/ethnic categories (for instance, between the                Chinese and Japanese among Asians).  The analysis will                          investigate how minority-group members attain residence in places               with characteristics that affect positively the quality of life                 and life chances of their residents.  The investigators will                    estimate models that view locational outcomes as a function of                  the socioeconomic, assimilation, and life-cycle characteristics                 of individuals, and will test whether these models vary by ethnic               group and across metropolitan areas.  Further, the investigators                will analyze the ability of individuals to \"convert\" their                      socioeconomic and assimilation characteristics into favorable                   residenti allocations.",
