 "awd_abstract_narration": "When the database grows larger and larger, the user no                     longer knows what is in the database. Nor does the user know                    clearly what should be retrieved.  How to get at the data becomes               a central problem for very large databases.  This research                      addresses this problem through data visualization and visual                    reasoning.  The main idea is to transform the data objects and                  present sample data in a visual space.  The user can then                       incrementally formulate the information retrieval request in the                visual space.  By combining data visualization, visual query,                   visual examples, and visual cues, this research will yield better               ways of formulating and modifying users' queries. A prototype                   system has been developed to serve as an experimental testbed.                  This research will develop a framework for testing new                          methodologies for visual reasoning as applied to information                    retrieval in very large databases.  It will also lead to more                   powerful iconic user interfaces, and combine previous research                  results in spatial reasoning, example-based programming, and                    approximate retrieval from databases.",
