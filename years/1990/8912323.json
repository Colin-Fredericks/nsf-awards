 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacterial spore formation is a primitive system of cellular                     differentiation.  A systematic study is proposed aimed at                       identifying and investigating the roles of essential vegetative                 genes that are needed during spore formation, and at integrating                information about essential genes with our knowledge of spo                     genes in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.  The study will focus                 on spoIIA, which codes for an RNA polymerase sigma factor, and                  genes that are likely to be involved in spore septum formation.                 It is proposed to search for essential genes that are directly or               indirectly under the control of spoIIA, and to extend the search                to include essential genes under the control of spoOH, which is                 associated with the start of sporulation.  The Controls of two                  vegetative division genes, ftsA and ftsZ, will be analyzed as                   likely prototypes of essential genes that are needed during                     sporulation.",
