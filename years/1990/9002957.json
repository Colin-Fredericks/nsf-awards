 "awd_abstract_narration": "IR and SS-NMR studies of supported iron carbidocarbonyl clusters              will be conducted.  This research combines expertise developed in the           field of supported metal catalyst chemistry with that of                        organometallic chemistry and homogeneous catalysis.  Borrowing from             surface chemistry techniques, metal clusters will be anchored to                supports to provide them with an environment more similar to that of a          heterogeneous catalyst is usually found.  In this environment, the              metal cluster will be subjected to thermal and chemical treatments              while monitoring the transformations that the ligands and the metal             framework undergo.  An effort will be made to probe the molecular               chemistry of the supported cluster system and compare the observations          with the known solution chemistry of the unsupported cluster and the            less-well-defined surface chemistry of related adsorbate-metal surface          systems.  The studies will provide an understanding of the structure            of the cluster systems throughout these interactions, giving the                potential to develop a fundamental understanding of a wide range of             metal-organic interactions that may provide invaluable clues                    concerning similar interactions on metal surfaces.                                Interactive activities include a workshop for women undergraduates            entitled, \"Graduate Education in Chemical Engineering.\"  This activity          will help encourage young women to consider careers in scientific               research.  In addition, a graduate course on topics in catalysis will           be taught.                                                                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
