 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Research Equipment Grant will aid the principal                investigators work in millimeter wave (MMW) research.  This work is             supported by NSF in two major areas:  MMW device and circuit analysis           and design, and MMW remote sensing of geophysical media.  In the                remote sensing area, the major objective is the development of basic            information of the MMW propagation and scattering in random and                 inhomogeneous media including snow, vegetation, and ground.                     Experimental studies have been conducted using the truck mounted MMW            radars.  Based on experimental data, theoretical models for snow,               vegetation, and trees have been developed.  However, to understand the          fundamental process of MMW interaction with random media, controlled            experiments need to be conducted, but efforts have been limited by a            lack of suitable MMW system.  In their study of MMW devices and                 circuits, the principal investigators have developed a number of                computer codes which perform a very accurate analysis of a wide                 variety of planar circuit elements.  These programs will be                     incorporated into a user friendly CAD package.  In addition, MMW                circuits will be fabricated and tested in order to check our                    analytical models.  The proposed MMW measurement and design system              should enhance the ability to conduct experiments and develop new               theoretical models.",
