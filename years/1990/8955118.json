 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project of St. Olaf College is a two-year program to improve               classroom teaching of geometry in secondary schools by empowering               teachers to integrate modern computing technology into their                    instruction.  The program will develop a cadre of master geometry               teachers called the Teacher Action Group (TAG), from schools within             sixty miles of St. Olaf.  During the first year, the TAG members will           attend workshops to enhance their subject matter, pedagogy, computer,           and leadership skills.  During the second year, the TAG members and the         project staff will offer similar workshops to increase the size of the          group prepared for implementation and outreach.  Teachers in the larger         group will come from schools located within 200 miles of St. Olaf.  In          all, one hundred teachers will participate in the project.  The                 Mathematics Department at St. Olaf College enjoys an excellent national         reputation and position of leadership in the general mathematics                education community.  St. Olaf College and the participating districts          are contributing an amount equal to 37% of the National Science                 Foundation request.",
