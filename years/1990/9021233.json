 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alliance for Success in the academic consortium of 13                       major research institutions and six historically Black                          colleges and universities.  The Alliance was established in                     February of 1989 as a comprehensive and cooperative effort to                   increase the numbers of minority faculty members nationally.                    Its programs and initiatives are intended to affect the                         pipeline of minority students at several critical stages from                   the freshman year through post- doctoral research activities.                   Emphasis during the undergraduate phase is focused on the                       preparation, motivation and support of honors students in                       their pursuit of graduate study and academic careers.                                                                                                           Alliance institutions have the experience and resources                         required to significantly increase minority representation                      in the sciences and engineering (S&E).  The highly successful                   Summer Research Opportunities Program (SROP) has dramatically                   increased the graduation and retention rates among minority                     students.  Science inception of the SROP in 1986, 99% of its                    1,514 minority participants are still enrolled or have                          graduated, 66% of its graduates have entered                                    post-baccalaureate programs (three times the national                           average for all baccalaureates), and over 50% have indicated                    an interest in becoming professors.  The major research                         institutions in the Alliance, who engage in over $2 billion                     worth of externally funded research annually and confer over                    17% of the S&E PhD degrees awarded annually in the United                       States, have the capacity to ensure high quality graduate                       education for all graduates of Alliance programs who are                        admitted to their graduate schools.                                                                                                                             Utilizing the invaluable experience of five year of the SROP                    program as a firm foundation, we intend to take a giant step                    that could literally change the face of American science and                    engineering.  The Alliance proposes planning activities to                      address specifically undergraduate S&E education.  The                          planning process will focus on expansion and enhancement of                     the Alliance Summer Research Opportunities Program for S&E                      minority students, development of criteria for a Summer S&E                     Institute, identification of mechanisms for instructional and                   curricular enrichment activities in S&E disciplines,                            development of recruiting strategies directed at increasing                     minority student participation in S&E, and coordination of                      data collection, measurement and evaluation for determining                     the success rate of Alliance programs.  The outcome from each                   of these planning efforts is intended to significantly                          improve the undergraduate educational experience of minority                    S&E students, and to prepare and motivate them to pursue                        graduate studies leading toward productive faculty careers.                     Because they are part of an integrated and longitudinal set                     of initiative, and because the product of one program will                      positively influence the level of participation and success                     rate of the next program in the serves, we believe the effect                   of the whole will greatly exceed the sum of the individual                      components.                                                                                                                                                     On behalf of the chief academic officers of the Alliance for                    Success, we request funding in the among of $40,000 to                          undertake the planning outlined above, and to develop from                      it a strong implementation proposal.  Alliance member                           institutions have already committed $80,000 for the current                     year to provide the infrastructures for the planning                            process.  A partnership with NSF Alliances for Minority                         Participation Program will make possible the stimulation                        of positive change in the participation of minorities in                        science and  engineering.",
