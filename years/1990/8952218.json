 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interdisciplinary undergraduate course in image processing is the            thrust of this project.  It is intended that this course primarily              serve majors in both Computer Science and Electrical Engineering,               although other departments such as Astronomy, Geology and Pharmacy have         expressed strong interest in such a course for their majors as well.                                                                                            The course itself will focus on the fundamental data operations of              computer vision such as image formation two-dimensional feature                 detection, representation and basic pattern recognition algorithms.             The proposed project will facilitate the implementation of an                   undergraduate computer vision laboratory in which students will be able         to digitize and display images which they have processed according to           the specifications of required assignments.  Each student enrolled in           the course will also be required to perform an independent image                processing project which extends the knowledge developed during the             course.",
