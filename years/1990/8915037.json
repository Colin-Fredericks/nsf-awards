 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thermotolerant nitrogen-fixing bacterium Rhodospirillum                     centenum, isolated in 1987, is unique among photosynthetic                      prokaryotes in that it produces desiccation- and heat-                          resistant cysts.  R. centenum is the only Rhodospirillum                        species known to be amenable to facile genetic and molecular                    biological analysis.  More than 100 mutants with defects in                     photosynthetic metabolism have been isolated, and these will                    be characterized biochemically as part of a major objective,                    namely, mapping the order of the photosynthesis genes of this                   organism.  Determination of the gene order will provide data                    of importance for future work on \"photochemical reaction                        centers\" and for assessing the possible significance of                         \"lateral gene transfer\" in the evolution of photosynthetic                      systems.  Control of expression of photosynthesis genes in R.                   centenum will also be investigated, especially in regard to                     effects of molecular oxygen.  Because the availability of an                    increased range of unusual phenotypes provides experimental                     systems of value for study of a number of fundamental                           problems, searches for previously unknown biotypes of non-                      oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria will continue using various                    selective enrichment and other procedures.                                                                                                                      Anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are widely distributed in                    nature and have been isolated from a great variety of                           ecological niches.  In certain locales they have been                           identified as primary producers of organic matter and they                      are prominent catalysts in various geochemical cycles.  They                    have also emerged as outstanding experimental systems for                       analysis of the basic mechanisms of energy conversion in all                    types of photosynthetic organisms.  It is important to                          decipher the evolutionary relationships between these                           organisms.  Using both classical genetics and molecular                         biology, these relationships will be explored with the                          recently discovered bacterium, Rhodospirillum centenum.",
