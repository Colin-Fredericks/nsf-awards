 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project incorporates two modern spectroscopic instruments                  into a novel, four-year, project-based laboratory program.  The                 instruments include an atomic absorption (AA) spectrometer, used                in first- and second-year labs, and a Fourier -transform infrared               (FTIR) spectrometer, used in second- and third-year labs.  The                  major goal for students in this program, the development of                     independence and resourcefulness, is implemented by labs with                   integrated content that are separate from lecture courses and                   that operate on the basis of individualized, multi-week student                 projects.  Both the realism and openendedness of such a program                 necessitate early and intensive use of modern instruments that                  are fast and versatile.  The chemistry program at the institution               offers a realistice introduction to the investigatory nature of                 science for the many students taking only one or two years of                   chemistry and fosters a smooth transition by majors into                        undergraduate research, graduate study, and chemical careers.                   Student projects using these instruments range from AA analysis                 of coordination compounds prepared in first-year labs to                        research-level study of hydrogen bonding with FTIR in third-year                projects.                                                                                                                                                       The insitution has contributed to this project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
