 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will show how activity in protests for municipal                  services in the Mexican city of Guadalajara affects relations                   between the female protesters and their male relatives.  Latin                  culture defines female activity in terms of home and family, so                 this sort of public activism runs counter to the dominant norms                 of the culture.  The project will see how men and women deal with               these contradictions in their lives.  Methods used include                      consultation with local newspaper archives, re-analysis of a                    household survey conducted by a local research facility, surveys                of 100 households in a poor neighborhood, and intensive                         interviews with both participant and non-participant households.                                                                                                This research is important because popular demonstrations for                   civil services are widespread in the world (witness Eastern                     Europe i 1989).  Understanding of the dynamics of such activity,                on an individual, family, and household level can help society                  form policies to respond appropriately.",
