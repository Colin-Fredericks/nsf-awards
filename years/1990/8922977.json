 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of Dr. Kleinrock's research has focused on mechanics ofthe                 now-classic propagating spreading center at 95.9'W on the East                  Pacific Rise. An oddity of this and all propagators is the ocean                crust gets transferred from one lithospheric plate to another as                the \"active\" spreading axis advances into and splits the \"old\"                  crust. Complex deformation patterns are known to develop between                the active and inactive spreading centers. Two theories exist to                explain this deformation: 1) the \"deck of cards model\" that                     predicts displacement is accomodated along pervasive ridge-normal               faults: and 2) the \"bookshelf tectonics\" model that predicts                    deformation is taken up by crustal block rotation about vertical                axes. Dr. Kleinrock will test the latter by examining piston                    cores for down-core rotation relative to the earth's magnetic                   field. During a recent cruise, he supervised the acquisition of 6               piston cores within the regions of suspected deformation at the                 95.5'W system. Each was equipped with a corehead camera to record               obsolute orientation, rotation, and departures from vertical that               occured during the coring process. Dr. Lisa Tauxe at Scripps will               conduct full-core, pass-thorough cryogenic magnetometer                         measurements on these cores. When split, subsamples will be                     analyzed for remnant magnetization, Inclination and declination                 values derived from these analyses will be provided to Dr.                      Kleinrock who will then incorporate the corehead information to                 remove corring artifacts to construct a down-core history of                    absolute rotation for each core. He estimates that at least 45'                 of block rotation has occurred in the region, and the technique                 proposed here will be able to resolve rotations of roughly 10'.",
