 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research on social inequality has focused                                attention on the role played by organizational promotion                        policies in shaping career and income histories.  While much                    of this work assumes that promotion policies exert a                            significant influence on these histories, little evidence                       exists to support this assumption.  Thus, this study                            addresses the structure of career mobility by looking at the                    characteristics of jobs and workers that permit workers to                      move up job ladders within a sample of organizations.  Also,                    it examines the extent to which patterns are guided by formal                   organizational policies.  The study looks at the ways in                        which social inequality is generated by career movements that                   are consistent or inconsistent with organizational policies.                                                                                                    The Principal Investigator draws on the California State                        Civil Service data base to test various hypotheses about the                    nature of career dynamics.  The data base provides                              comprehensive information on formal promotion policies and                      related Civil Service rules and procedures and includes                         detailed personnel records describing the career histories of                   several thousand civil servants during the period 1974 to                       1985.                                                                                                                                                           The findings from this study should contribute to our                           understanding of the causes and nature of social inequality.                    The results will also provide a means by which to better                        understand the effects of Affirmative Action programs and                       other interventions aimed at improving opportunities by                         modifying promotion policies.",
