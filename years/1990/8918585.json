The group will                  concentrate its research efforts on Experiment-706 at Fermilab                  (a study of direct photon production in hadronic collisions),                   on experiments with the L3 detector at CERN, (European Center                   for Elementary Particle Physics, high energy electron positron                  collisions in the LEP collider), and on the plastic                             scintillating fiber tracking and vertex finding generic                         detector development program for the Superconducting Super                      Collider.  The E-706 experimental program at Fermilab involves                  a continuation of the analysis of the data from the 1987-88                     run, and two additional runs, one in 1990, the other in 1992.                   The work at CERN involves a continuation of the application of                  the scintillating fiber technique to the calibration and                        monitoring of the tracking system for charged particles in the                  L3 detector.  The scintillilng fiber development program                        involves software simulation, bench-tests in the laboratories                   at Northeastern of various fiber options and tests of different                 PSF detector options with cosmic rays and in a particle beam.",
