 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves theoretical and experimental work on a                    problem of great importance for game theory generally and for the               evaluation of game-theoretic experiments.  The problem to be                    addressed deals with learning and models of learning.  Of                       particular interest is the learning which occurs when individuals               play the same game against different opponents.  The theoretical                part of the project will focus on studying those conditions under               which individuals do or do not converge in such games to the Nash               equilibrium.  The experimental portion of the project will pursue               a combination of two classes of designs in an attempt to evaluate               both the theory of strategic learning and some of the myopic                    learning models developed by the investigators.  The first design               involves repeated play of a game with incomplete information                    between fixed opponents, while the second involves repeated play                between changing opponents.  These designs will enable the                      investigators to study learning explicitly within a dynamic                     framework.",
