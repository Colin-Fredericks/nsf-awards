 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robinson will conduct research in the area of                    multi-dimensional symbolic dynamical systems associated with                    tilings of the plane and higher dimensional Euclidean spaces.                   These dynamical systems are continuous actions of n-dimensional                 Euclidean space on compact metric spaces.  They are related to                  Ambrose-Kakutani-Rudolph representation theory.  In addition,                   Professor Robinson will continue his work on how various ergodic                properties lift to extensions.  In particular he will concentrate               on how joinings lift to extensions.                                                  In the early 1980's experimental physicists were surprised                 to see five-fold rotational symmetry in what they thought to be                 a periodic crystal.  This is however a mathematical impossibility               and it was later observed that the substance was not periodic but               rather \"quasiperiodic\".  The research of Professor Robinson will                attempt to apply techniques from ergodic theory and dynamical                   systems to understand this situation.",
