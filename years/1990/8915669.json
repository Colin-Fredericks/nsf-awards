 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fish family Liparididae is a widely distributed, benthic taxon              in temperate and cold waters of the Northern and Southern                       Hemispheres.  Recent studies show that there may be as many species             in the Southern Ocean as in the Bering Sea, previously considered               an area of highest species diversity and primary center of                      distribution.  Liparidids are probably the most species-rich family             in the Southern Ocean, contrary to the traditional view giving this             position to the endemic southern family Nototheniidae.  The most                species-rich liparidid genus is Careproctus, which has the broadest             depth range of 50 to 7200 m.  It includes about 18 undescribed                  Antarctic species and is the only group of the Southern Ocean                   liparidids not recently reviewed taxonomically.   The immediate                 goals of the proposed research are the identification, description              and redescription of Careproctus species occurring in the Southern              Ocean.  Standard taxonomic methods will be used, but emphasis will              be on a search for previously unused distintive characters in the               liparidid genus.  The identification and description of all                     Antarctic liparidids will permit studies leading to better                      understanding of the zoogeography and history of the Antarctic                  ichthyofauna, comparison of the Antaractic liparidid fauna with                 that of the Bering Sea, and may help explain why and how the family             achieved its bi-polar distribution and high species diversity.                  Accurate species descriptions will be of great assistance in                    studying the changes which occur during adaptation to deep-sea                  life, the ecology of the Southern Ocean and adjacent waters, and                the distribution and zoogeography of Antarctic fishes.",
