 "awd_abstract_narration": "In southern China an unusual association of metals including               molybdenum, nickel, platinum group metals and gold occurs in                    Lower Cambrian black shales.  These metals are especially                       concentrated in thin beds and lenses of massive sulfides. Fan et                al. (1973; 1978) report values for shales and associated massive                sulfides beds exceeding 2% Mo. 2% Ni, 3% Zn, 700 ppb Au, 200-400                ppb Pt, 200-400 ppb Pb and 50 ppb Ir.  In several cases metal                   values are at or near what would be ore grades in conventional                  deposits.  For example, at one mine near Zunyi, Guizhou province,               molybdenum is now being extracted from a shale-hosted nodular                   sulfide bed.  This is the only place in the world from which this               strategic metal is recovered from shale.  Black shale-hosted Ni-                Mo-Pt-Au deposits can be traced across ten provinces in southern                China (Chen et al., 1982) and may constitute a metal resource of                great economic potential.  The mineralization includes metal                    which normally occur in two distinct associations:  i.e., classic               polymetallic hydrothermal deposits (Zn, Au, Mo) and                             igneous/pneumatolitic deposits associated with mafic igneous                    rocks (Ni, Pt, Pd).  Considering the field relations and textural               features described by Chen (1988a, b), there is good possibility                that the polymetallic sulfide lenses and beds were developed as                 classic volcanogenic submarine exhalites during the Cambrian.                   Additional evidence in support of this hypothesis will be sought                during the proposed study.  However, taking into account the                    peculiar geochemical behavior of molybdenum and certain other ore               constituents in alkaline solutions, it is also possible that the                ore metals were introduced in two stages:  (1) early                            precipitation of precious metal-bearing nodular Fe-Ni sulfide                   exhalites from submarine hot springs, followed by (2) late                      supergene precipitation of significant amounts of Mo and other                  metals during modern weathering while the spectacular \"tower\"                   karst topography of southern China was formed (Mobilization of                  metals by deep weathering during the Late Precambrian may also be               a factor).  Studies of metal distributions, textural relations,                 fluid inclusions and isotopes for samples from key locations in                 Guizhou, Yunnan and Hunan where sulfide lenses occur in Cambrian                shales in the midst of well-developed tower karst topography,                   will help to distinguish between these possibilities by                         establishing whether or not there were two stages of ore                        deposition in the shales of southern China.  Analyses of host and               country rocks in and near the modern weathering zone and ancient                fractures will be used to assess the probable impact of supergene               mobilization of Mo and other elements from source beds.",
