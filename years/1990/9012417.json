 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project partially supports field expenses                    for two U.S. scientists, Dr. James Hunt and Dr. Robert Jeanne                   of the Department of Biology, Universiy of Missouri,                            St. Louis, while conducting research in India in collaboration                  with Dr. R. Gadagkar of the Indian Institute of Science in                      Bangalore.  In the research, work will be done on Ropalidia                     montana, one of the social wasps of the tropics.  It is of                      considerable interest as one of very few species of social                      paper wasps to have discrete queen/worker dimorphism.  The                      research will address the following questions: 1. does the                      species have an alarm pheromone and what is its source, 2. do                   the wasps use chemicals to mark trails during swarm                             emigration, 3. do male and female larvae yield different                        quantities of saliva during food exchange with adults, 4. how                   do larvae escape their pupal cells, and 5. what is the                          apparent pattern of task partitioning by forager worker                         wasps?.  This work will involve selection of a wasp colony and                  removing it from its natural habitat on high trees to an area                   of shrubs where observations can be made more easily.                                                                                                           Scope:  This small grant will provide funds for the two U.S.                    scientists to conduct research of interest, to the U.S., in                     the area of population biology and with the collaboration of                    their host at one of India's prestigeous academic and research                  institutes.  Funds for travel to India were made available to                   the scientists from other sources.  This research complements                   work being done by Dr. Hunt under a grant BSR8805971 from the                   Population Biology Program on \"Nourishment, Trophallaxis and                    Caste in Primitvely Social Wasps\".",
