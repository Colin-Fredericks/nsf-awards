 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sulfur chemistry of proteins and other biological                           molecules include the \"soft\" donor groups thiol,                                thioether, and disulfide.  Specific examples of this                            group of biological molecules are antibiotics such as                           penicillin and cephalosporin, essential cofactors such as                       d-biotin, immunoglobins such as IgG and sulfur proteins                         such as metallothionein, papain, and liver alcohol                              dehydrogenase.  Soft donor groups can complex selectivity                       with soft metal ions such as Ag(I), Cu(I), Au(I), Hg(II),                       and Pt(II).  This selective Lewis acid-base interaction                         provides a basis for a new class of metal affinity                              separations named Immobilized Soft Metal (ISM)                                  adsorption.  ISM will complement Immobilized Metal                              Affinity (IMA) chromatography in that IMA uses                                  borderline-hard acceptors such as Cu(II), Zn(II), and                           Ni(II) that interact with the exposed histidine residues                        of proteins.                                                                                                                                                    Pilot experiments have confirmed the utility of this                            technique in purifying d-biotin from a dilute mixture                           with its sulfur-deficient, biosynthetic precursor d-                            desthiobiotin.  Also, metallothionein is shown to be                            removed from solution due to complexation with                                  immobilized Ag(I) ions.  It is proposed that ISM be                             explored as a new technique with broad applicability to                         biochemical separations.  Experiments will provide data                         to establish a reactivity model explaining the                                  interactions of biochemical functional groups with soft                         metal ions.  ISM may also provide a unique tool for                             biosensor development through the use of the bioconjugate                       of proteins with d-biotin.  Scanning Tunneling Microscopy                       (STM) has been used to obtain the first image of an                             immunoglobin molecule in aqueous solution.  The                                 interaction between Ag(I) and biotin conjugated                                 antibodies in aqueous solution can be used to study                             immunoglobin structure and function through STM.",
