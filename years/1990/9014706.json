 "awd_abstract_narration": "The impacts of large-scale human disturbance on natural areas have         not been well documented.  Large-scale forest clearing provides an              opportunity to examine the role of anthropogenic disturbance in the             dynamics of forest succession.  Nearly all of the original forest cover         on the Georgia piedmont has been removed for agriculture since European         settlement began in the early 19th Century.  Much of this land later            was abandoned and reverted to forest.  It is therefore an excellent             locale in which to evaluate whether differences between pre-colonial            and present-day forest vegetation can be attributed to human                    disturbance.  This doctoral dissertation project will use a systematic          sample drawn from a presettlement forest survey conducted by the state          of Georgia in order to reconstruct species-environment relations of             this period.  The sample will be analyzed to determine the physical             controls of species distribution, the degree to which these factors             explain forest patterns, and the ecological roles of species.  The              composition and structure of present-day vegetation will be sampled             throughout the study area to establish the impacts of forest clearing           by examining the successional status of the modern vegetation and               variation in compositional controls between the two periods.                         This research will clarify theoretical aspects of forest                   succession, such as distinctions between natural and artificial                 disturbance and effects of the varied scales of technological impacts           by native and immigrant Americans.  It therefore will contribute to the         scientific basis of our understanding of human-environmental                    relationships.  In addition, it will contribute to the understanding of         the region's environmental history and to evaluation of practical and           conceptual issues in environmental management.  The project also will           provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to               continue to develop independent research skills.",
