 "awd_abstract_narration": "Epicuticular hydrocarbons (HC) of insects play an essential                role in their adaptation to terrestrial environments because they               help decrease cuticle permeability to water, thereby reducing the               risk of lethal dehydration. (The cuticle is the external,                       hardened tissue which surrounds the body of an insect.  The                     epicuticle is the outermost layer of the cuticle.)  The                         epicuticular HC also perform a pheromonal function during                       courtship and mating of some Drosophila species. The principal                  investigators have discovered that variation  in the epicuticular               HC  profile of male D. mojavensis is responsible for a large                    proportion of intermale variation in male success--females mate                 five times more frequently with males whose epicuticular HC                     profile is similar to that of males raised at 17o C.                                 The proposed research will examine the relationship between                variation in the abiotic and biotic environmental factors                       (temperature, humidity, diet, etc.) that have been found in                     laboratory experiments to be responsible for variation  in                      epicuticular HC composition, cuticle permeability, and sexual                   behavior in D. mojavensis.  Data for all three parameters will be               obtained both in the lab and in the field under natural                         conditions, in concert with a detailed assessment of the                        microhabitat climatological regime encountered by male and female               D. mojavensis during the course of their daily activities.                      Additional field and laboratory experiments will assess the                     impact of variation in the three parameters on the mating system                of D. mojavensis.  This research is unique in that it promises to               identify  a biological trait that plays an important role in                    individual survival as well as reproduction.",
