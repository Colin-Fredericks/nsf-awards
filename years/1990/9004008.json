 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air Conditioning is regarded as a necessity by modern society.             The development of more efficient Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)                      refrigerant free air conditioners is an extremely important goal                for the air conditioning industry.  This proposal proposes the                  creation of a university industrial cooperative research center to              contribute to the technology base for a new generation of equipment             which will reduce and ultimately eliminate reliance on CFCs and to              provide an opportunity for manufacturers to coordinate research                 and share results, increasing competitiveness on an international               scale.                                                                               The Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                    Advanced Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Technology will perform             research on air conditioning and heating components including heat              exchanges, compressors and alternative components and will also                 address system problems associated with mobile Air Conditioning                 Systems, Domestic Refrigeration Freezers and General Heatpump and               Refrigeration Systems.                                                               This project has been coordinated with Dr. William                         Grosshandler, Program Director for Thermal Systems Engineering in               CTS Division.                                                                        The Program Manager recommends that the University of Illinois             at Urbana be awarded $95,000 for the first year of a five year                  continuing grant.  $50,000 is to be provided by NSF and $40,000 by              the U.S. EPA via an Interagency Agreement.                                           In addition this award provides $5,000 for a woman,                        undergraduate research assistant for one year under the NSF Women,              Minority, and Disabled Engineering Research Assistants Program.                 The student will augment the research of the Center by studying and             analyzing domestic refrigerator-freezers to determine the impact                of new refrigerants on system performance.                                           Near the end of each twelve month period, the Program Manager              and/or the Directors of the Engineering Centers Division reviews                the progress of the center on a number of renewal criteria,                     including the following:  (1) extent to which the                               University/Industry interaction and collaboration is developing;                (2) extent to which the support base for the center is expanding;               (3) extent to which a robust research program is developing.  If                the review is satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend                  support of the next period of this continuing grant.",
