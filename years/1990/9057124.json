 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Presidential Young Investigator will continue working on               several problems in the general area of fluid transport.  The                   first area involves the study of fluid stability;  in particular,               Bayly will try to extend results on broadband instability from                  two dimensions to three dimensions.  The goal of this research is               to develop a global picture of instability modes and hence, a                   coherent picture of broadband instabilities in general flows.                   The second area involves the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) dynamo                   problem;  in particular, the investigator and a colleague at NYU                will try to discover what is needed to produce a fast dynamo.                   Their strategy is to perform high-resolution MHD simulations of                 dynamo actions and establish rigorous error bounds on the                       numerical discretizations.                                                           Various types of fluid dynamical phenomena involve the                     creation and evolution of instabilities.  An instability is                     produced when a small or large perturbation upsets an existing                  balance of forces and leads to the formation of a new equilibrium               state, which in turn might itself change in response to new                     perturbations.  It is easy to imagine that one is interested in                 such changes in equilibrium states, since the design of apparatus               depends crucially upon what the prevailing equilibrium state is                 thought to be in a given flow situation.  The investigator will                 use analytical and computational tools to describe the evolution                of broadband instabilities in complex flows and the impact of                   relatively large disturbances.",
