 "awd_abstract_narration": "The discovery of optical second harmonic generation in                          crystals in 1961 spurred rapid progress in the field of                         nonlinear optics.  Nonlinear optical materials are materials                    whose optical properties depend upon the intensity of light                     incident upon them.  The nonlinearity could be in the form of                   an intensity dependent refractive index or a saturable                          absorption.  These materials have practical applications in                     telecommunications, digital computers, and laser fusion.  They                  have the potential to become future optical semiconductors                      which can operate at frequencies two to three orders of                         magnitude higher than current semiconductor technology.  The                    PI plans to explore formation of commercially viable nonlinear                  optical materials using the sol-gel technique.  The sol-gel                     process is a means for producing inorganic films and                            monolithic structures from organo-metallic monomeric                            compounds.  The process is analogous to step reaction                           polymerizations in organic systems where the monomer is                         usually a metal alkoxide such as tetramethoxysilane.  These                     reactions are run at room temperature, in a common solvent for                  alkoxide and water, and using either an acid or base catalyst.                                                                                                  The sol-gel process will be used to produce new nonlinear                       optical materials by polymerizing modified alkoxide monomers                    of the form RSi(OR')3 where R represents an organic                             functionality demonstrated to have a high nonlinear                             susceptibility.  Work will focus on R-groups which are                          primarily substituted benzenes, pyridines and azo dyes.                         Commercially available alkoxides and custom alkoxides                           synthesized as part of this research will be investigated.                      Thin film and monolithic materials will be made.  To                            facilitate the observation of second-order nonlinear effects,                   the dipoles of the organic functionality will be aligned using                  corona poling.  The second-order and third-order                                susceptibilities of the starting materials as well as the                       polymerized materials will be assessed using second harmonic                    generation and four-wave mixing respectively.  The strength,                    chemical and environmental resistances, and thermal stability                   of the film and bulk materials will also be determined.",
