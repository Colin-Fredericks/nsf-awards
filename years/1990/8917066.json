 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adelie penguins, Pygoscelis adeliae, are the most abundant of the               Antarctic penguins and are important components of the Antarctic                marine ecosystem.  The breeding ecology, behavior, and thermal                  physiology of Adelies have been extensively studied by a variety                of investigators, but many aspects of their ecological and                      reproductive energetics have not been described.  In previous NSF-              funded research, the effects of temperature and weather (e.g., wind             and sunlight) on the energy costs of thermoregulation in breeding               Adelies and their chicks were determined.  The purpose of this                  research is to measure rates of energy consumption and changes in               body composition in breeding Adelies, and to simultaneously study               their foraging behavior.  This will enable us to determine                      reproductive effort.  The isotopic technique of doubly labeled                  water (DLW) will be used to determine both energy flux and body                 composition, at various times throughout the breeding season.  The              behavior, physiology, and energetics of diving during foraging                  trips will be studied with computerized time-depth recorders (TDR).             Simultaneous DLW and TDR studies will provide information on                    foraging costs and foraging efficiency.  Stomach content analysis               will reveal what the birds are eating.  Diet information combined               with DLW measurements will allow calculation of rates of food                   consumption, and, hence, the trophic impact of breeding Adelies on              the surrounding marine ecosystem.",
