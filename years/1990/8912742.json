 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in algebraic geometry,                    coding theory, and analytic number theory of Professor Carlos J.                Moreno of Baruch College of the City University of New York. Dr.                Moreno will be working on several questions, all inter-                         disciplinary within mathematics. One of these is to apply                       techniques of algebraic geometry to the theory of the error                     correcting codes arising from algebraic curves that were first                  developed by Goppa. Another field in which Dr. Moreno will be                   working involves congruence properties for the weight                           multiplicities and partition functions of highest weight                        representations of Kac-Moody Lie algebras.                                           The several themes of Professor Moreno's research are                      unified by his expertise in algebraic geometry. This is one of                  the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and in robotics.",
