 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Batterman is investigating the connections between                          classical and quantum mechanics,in light of the fact that                       classical systems appear to allow generic chaotic behavior                      while quantum systems do not.  One question he is asking is                     that of a definition of chaos for quantum systems.  While                       there is at least some consensus on how to define chaos in                      classical physics,the question of a definition for chaos in                     quantum mechanics is completely open.                                                                                                                           One approach to a quantum definition for chaos is to adopt an                   algorithmic complexity definition.  The virtue of this view                     is that it seems to be \"theory neutral.\"  On this definition,                   quantum mechanics is completely inhospitable to chaos.  Dr.                     Batterman argues that this definition is to be resisted, since                  to a certain degree it divorces the issue of chaos from the                     dynamics.  Instead, Dr. Batterman argues that a proper                          understanding of the correspondence principle resolves the                      problem of defining quantum chaos.  The correspondence                          principle, when properly interpreted already supplies a                         unified account of chaos--for both classical and quantum                        mechanics.  Dr. Batterman argues that the interpretation of                     the correspondence principle which he advocates has historical                  support which can be found in Niels Bohr's early writing on                     the quantum theory.",
