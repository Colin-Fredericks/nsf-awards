 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lax-Nelson Lagrangian theory of an arbitrary dielectric                     crystal in interaction with the electromagnetic field will be                   applied to several interactions.  The elastooptic effect will be                studied in a crystal near a second-order phase transition.  This                will explore how the asymmetry of the linear elastic stiffness                  tensor, produced by coupling to rotation and recently predicted                 by this theory, can be measured.  The recent prediction of this                 theory that natural optical activity can arise form three                       distinct mechanisms in crystals and produce terms having two                    types of frequency dispersion will be extended to magnetically                  induced optical activity (Faraday effect).  The acoustic analog                 of optical activity, acoustic activity will also be explored.                   The frequency shift of optic modes caused by the application of                 stress or an electric field will be calculated and related to the               elastooptic effect.  A resolution to the Minkowski-Abraham                      controversy will be presented based on the general conservation                 laws of real momentum and pseudo-momentum expressed in the                      spatial and material coordinate systems respectively and upon our               previous analysis of the general nonlinear stress tensor of a                   dielectric crystal in interaction with the electromagnetic field.               The Lagrangian theory will be generalized to include intrinsic                  spin of the particles composing the crystal lattice.  This will                 allow treatment of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic interactions.                This will be accomplished by the introduction of Grassman                       variables.",
