 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Hirsh is analyzing the changes in values and motivations that               contributed in recent years to the restructuring of the American                electric utility industry.  Taking an historical and humanistic                 perspective, he is paying particular attention to evolving                      attitudes of individuals in the regulatory community--attitudes                 that have been forced to change due to a variety of influences.                 Technological change has been one of these influences, though it                has been poorly understood. As technology used in the industry                  began stagnating in the 1960s and 1970s, ending an 80 year trend                of continuous improvement and declining unit costs, regulators                  started questioning the rationale for the utility industry's status             as a \"natural monopoly.\"  At the same time, regulators' values and              perceptions were influenced by novel economic theories and passage              in 1978 of new legislation that stimulated technological innovation             for use by non-utility generators.  The questioning by regulators               of whether regulated natural electric utility monopolies were still             \"in the public interest\" has recently been translated into partial              deregulation of the industry.  Additionally, this work will address             the issue of how regulators' new values have been converted into                novel incentives for technological innovation and how these                     incentives contribute to a restructuring movement that will                     continue into the 1990s and beyond.                                                                                                                             Dr. Hirsh's aim is to produce a study detailing the social,                     intellectual, and technical origins of a restructured utility                   industry.  The work will transcend political and economic                       discussions and provide original perspectives to historians of                  technology, industry managers and public policy makers.  It will                also serve an immediate need of managers and policy analysts by                 offering a better understanding of participants' motivations as a               vital industry undergoes wrenching changes.",
