Professor Chen is Director of                               the Institute's Laboratory of Resources and                                     Environment Information System (LREIS).  The                                    investigators will establish a Geographic Information                           System (GIS) for urban China and conduct research                               on the characteristics and functions of Chinese                                 urban places, the process of urbanization, and the                              evolution of the Chinese urban system.  The project                             is sponsored jointly by NSF and the Chinese Academy                             of Sciences.                                                                                                                                                    The research plan consists of the following tasks:                              (1) mapping contemporary urban China to obtain an                               overview of all urban places; (2) analyzing the                                 spatial interaction between places in the Chinese                               the urban system; and (3) conducting two case                                   studies in the Beijing.Tianjin.Tangshan economic                                development region and Shandong province that will                              focus on urban nodes and linkages, the city                                     characteristics of today, and the changes since                                 1949.  In China the research work will be conducted                             by the staff of the LREIS, who will design the                                  geocoding system and the database structures of                                 the GIS, digitize and input the locations of the                                urban places, and input the published data on town                              and city socioeconomic, land, and transportation                                systems.  During the course of the project,                                     Professor Chen will spend time at the University of                             Minnesota, participating in the data evaluation.",
