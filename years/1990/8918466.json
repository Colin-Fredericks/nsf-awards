 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kenneth Wells of the University of California at Davis                 is studying fungi of the group Heterobasidiomycetes, primarily                  wood-decaying fungi found in temperate regions of North America                 and western Europe.  The fruiting bodies, or basidiocarps, have                 traditionally been used as the sole basis for the classification                of these species, especially microscopic characters of the sexual               reproductive structures.  Dr. Wells and others have shown over                  the past ten years that basidiocarp morphology does not                         accurately reflect genetic differences between species.  Gene                   differences at several loci, termed mating-type loci and                        sterility/fertility loci, are more important in determining                     whether strains can cross and form viable progeny.  Interbreeding               groups in turn form discrete species, usually with distinct                     habitat preferences.                                                                 Not all interbreeding populations are sharply defined,                     however.  Isolates from some populations are only partially                     interfertile with other populations.  Careful laboratory studies                of the genetic controls of such partial fertility will help                     determine how genetic and environmental factors interact to limit               sexual reproduction in these fungi.  Comparative morphological                  data generated by microscopy, results of pairing tests, and                     isozyme analyses of proteins are being used to examine species of               Exidia, Tremella, Exidiopsis, and Auricularia and to begin to                   assess the amount of genetic variability in natural populations                 of these saprophytes.",
