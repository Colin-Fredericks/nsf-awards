 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work by the Dr. Wells has demonstrated that                            organically bound aggregates of mineral grains are relatively                   common to estuarine water along the N. Carolina coast. These                    aggregates (>500 microns) are a food source for marine organisms,               affect chemical distributions, and may be responsible for a                     substantial part of the vertical mass flux in shallow water. Few                workers have been able to either observe or recover this \"marine                snow\". Using techniques developed in their previous NSF award,                  Dr. Wells and his collaborator Dr. Luettich will analyze the in                 situ characteristics of these aggrregates. Transects of                         stations across Cape Lookout Bight will be re-occupied every 3                  months for 2 years, vertical profiles will be re-occuppied every                3 months for 1 year, and moorings will be left in place for the                 duration of 3 \"northeaster\" storms. Photographs of aggregates, in               situ measurements of aggregate settling velocities, and                         sensors recording a variety of water column propoerties on                      moorings and tethered cables will: 1) yield details about the                   size, shape and abundance of large aggregates in Cape Lookout                   Bight and Barden Inlet; 2) investigate the effect of currents on                large aggregates; 3) provide settling velocities of aggregates;                 and 4) provide insight into the reponse of large aggregates to                  storm events and other seasonal phenomena.",
