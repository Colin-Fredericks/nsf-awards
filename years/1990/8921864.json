 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments have shown that people's evaluations of                             probabilistic outcomes do not conform to normative theory,                      especiallywhen they are asked to provide the probability that a                 single, isolated event will occur.  However, there is evidence                  that people responddifferently when probabilities refer to unique               rather than multiply occurring events.  This project explores                   whether the observed discrepancies are tied to situations in                    which probabilities apply to events that occur only once.                       This work is important because it will provide information on                   the generalizability of the conclusion that decision makers                     generally violate expected utility theory when making actual                    choices.                                                                                                                                                        The study will investigate whether framing risky prospects as                   multiply occurring events induces a long run perspective                        that results in the processing of probabilistic information                     more in accordance with normative principles.  Consistent                       with this hypothesis is recent evidence found by the                            investigators and others that some of the systematic                            violations of normative theory are reduced when subjects                        evaluate multiply occurring prospects.  A series of                             experiments will beconducted to investigate people's                            responses to single and multiply occurring events.  The                         first two experiments examine the impact of the option of                       multiple play on subjective utilities and probabilities.                        Another experiment looks at the question of whether                             opportunity for multiple play reduces framing effects.  A                       final experiment will examine how experienced experimental                      subjects perceive probabilistic events ina financial audit                      context.",
