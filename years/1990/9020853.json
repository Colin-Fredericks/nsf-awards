The joint                         seminar, involving twelve U.S. participants, will be held                       from November 5-13, 1990, in Seoul and Taejon, Korea.  The                      purpose of this seminar is to bring together for mutual                         benefit U.S. and Korean astronomers to (1) exchange                             information on contemporary techniques for investigating                        both close and wide binary star systems and (2) assess,                         identify, and advise NSF and KOSEF (Korea Science and                           Engineering Foundation) on priority areas for future                            cooperation in this field.  Papers presented at the seminar                     will focus on new approaches for acquiring data, deriving                       fundamental quantities, and interpreting and modeling                           binary systems.                                                                                                                                                 The U.S. and Korean coordinators are highly respected                           scientists who have a record of successful collaboration in                     binary star astronomy.  This project is relevant to the                         objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science Program                        which seeks to increase the level of cooperation between                        U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through the                            exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and                          techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual                      benefit.  Korean participation will be supported by KOSEF.",
