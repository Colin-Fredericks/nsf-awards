 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work is concerned with the development, evaluation                 and testing of iterative algorithms and programs for solving                    large sparse systems of linear algebraic equations that typically               arise in the numerical solution of partial differential equations               by finite difference methods or by finite element methods.  The                 main emphasis is on the efficient use of vector and parallel                    computer architectures.  The research studies focus on parallel                 iterative algorithms designed for several types of computer                     architectures.  General research studies on certain aspects of                  iterative algorithms including convergence rates, determination                 of iterative algorithms, and the treatment of nonsymmetric                      systems will also be made.  A novel feature of the work is the                  development of hybrid iterative/direct methods designed to                      combine the best features of both types of methods.                             Computational kernels and research-oriented software will be                    developed for parallel architectures.  The algorithms and                       software will be evaluated using a class of test problems and                   also using linear systems derived from biomedical problems and                  other physical applications.  An important aspect of the work is                the collaboration with researchers at other institutions.  This                 will be especially important for the work on hybrid methods.//",
