 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sodium pump is the major ion transport ATPase of animal cell                plasma membranes which energizes many vital homeostatic transport               activities in cells and organs.  The first objective of the                     proposed research is to analyze movements of the sodium pump on                 the cell surface.  Through the use of synthetic peptides and                    purified proteins, new antibodies will be made that react with                  the beta subunit of the human enzyme.  Such antibodies should                   bind to the enzyme on the outside of human cells and permit                     quantitation of the number of sodium pump molecules on the cell                 surface.  These antibodies will also be used to study the folding               pattern of the beta subunit, and to study the traffic of the pump               to and from the surface of the cell.  The second objective is to                understand how cells previously selected for overproduction of                  the sodium pump inhibit the excess enzyme activity.  Assays of                  subcellular fractions will attempt to localize a pool of                        inhibited enzyme in the overproducing cells.  Antibodies to                     enzyme subunits will be used to detect alterations in subunit                   production or recognize protein modifications.  The combination                 of activity and antibody analyses is expected to define a site                  inside the cells where biochemical regulatory events turn off                   sodium pumps.                                                                                                                                                   The sodium pump is the major ion transport enzyme of animal cell                plasma membranes.  It maintains a low concentration of sodium                   inside the cell compared to outside, and this difference between                the sodium outside and inside provides the energy for many vital                homeostatic transport activities in cells and organs.  The                      ability of cells to control the sodium pump activity could be                   important for conserving cellular energy, controlling other                     membrane transport activities, and responding to ionic stresses.                This research should contribute to our understanding of the                     control of cellular sodium pump activity.",
