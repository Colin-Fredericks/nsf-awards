 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at developing a better understanding of                the nature of some of the basic econonic issues facing centrally                planned economies, especially as these issues relate to the                     transition of these economies to more market.oriented systems.                  The importance of this research stems from the historical                       significance of the economic transformation now under way in the                communist countries of Eastern Europe, and the need to better                   understand the salient economic issues involved.                                                                                                                This research is primarily an application of economic theory to                 the area of comparative economic systems, and it will improve our               understanding of the economic reform process in three areas.  The               first application will extend classical consumer theory from the                special case of market clearing prices to the more general case                 of arbitrary prices with search, waiting, and inventory behavior,               which are absent in the special case of market clearing.  The                   second study will show why planned economies are usually plagued                by shortages of consumer goods.  The third application will                     analyze the conditions under which a mixture of planned and                     market systems may be much worse than either system alone.  This                could have important implications for how one gets to a market                  system without making things much worse during the transition.",
