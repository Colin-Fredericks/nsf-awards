 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade statistical data and inference have                   played an important role in establishing the basic facts used for               public policy, e.g.estimating the prevalence of AIDS or HIV                     infection,  determining the risk of cancer from occupational or                 environmental exposures,  assessing changes in the income                       distribution and in the legal setting,  e.g. tax assessment                     inequality.  The purpose of this project is to study statistical                problems arising in these contexts and to develop appropriate                   probability models and statistical methodology for their                        solution.  Research on procedures for estimating the prevalence                 of a rare disease which preserve anonymity by combining                         individual samples into batches prior to testing is a major goal.               These  methods should enable health specialists to obtain the                   cooperation of the public as infected individuals and non-                      infected persons who are misclassified (false positive) will not                be identified.  Robust methods which lead to statistically valid                inferences when several scientifically plausible models may                     underlie the data or when a few observations may be erroneous                   will continue to be emphasized.  Recent legal decisions in the                  equal employment area have raised new questions concerning the                  measurement of discrimination.  It is planned to investigate the                statistical approaches used in Watson v. Fort Worth Bank and to                 examine the implications of the Ward's Cove case for more refined               data and methods of analysis.  Related problems arising in legal                and economic applications, e.g. the analysis of group data,  also               will be investigated.",
