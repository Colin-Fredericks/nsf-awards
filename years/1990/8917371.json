 "awd_abstract_narration": "Comparative studies have revealed the presence of a large number                of genes that are associated with nitrogen fixation in the                      obligate aerobe Azotobacter vinelandii but are not present in the               facultative anaerobe Klebsiella pneumoniae.  A number of these                  nif-associated genes have also been discovered in Rhodobacter                   capsulatus, Anabaena, and Bradyrhizobium japonicum and they are,                therefore, likely to be involved in nitrogen fixation under                     aerobic or microaerobic conditions.  In this project we will                    attempt to isolate and characterize all of the remaining                        nif-associated genes from A. vinelandii. Also, experiments                      designed to determine the physiological function of each                        nif-associated gene product will be performed.  Our approach will               involve the isolation of a set of mutant strains, each                          individually deleted for a specific nif-associated gene.  Also,                 deletions within nif-associated gene products will be placed in                 combination with other characterized nif-specific mutations.                    Such specifically constructed strains will be examined for; a)                  diazotrophic growth abilities, b) accumulation of nif-specific                  mRNAs, c) accumulation of nif-specific gene products,                           d) nitrogenase component protein specific activities, e) response               to molybdenum deprivation, and f) ability to recover from or cope               with various diazotrophic growth conditions.",
