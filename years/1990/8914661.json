 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support cooperative research between Dr. Gary                   Blanpied and colleagues at the Department of Physics, University                of Carolina and Dr. Jean-Pierre Didelez, Institute of Nuclear                   Physics, University of Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.  The research                  will focus on the study of pi and eta meson production ny nucleons              and high energy gamma rays.                                                                                                                                     Electromagnetic probes are becoming increasingly important in                   intermediate energy nuclear physics.  The two groups have col-                  laborated in the design and construction of the lead-glass based                high energy detector used in the detection of neutral pi mesons.                The investigators propose to complete this program and to expand                and reconfigure the spectrometer for detection of eta mesons.  The              experience and expertise developed with this detector will have                 application in the US at CEBAF, the US flagship electromagnetic                 nuclear physics facility, in a program of photo- and electro-meson              production studies.  The project will benefit from the complementary            expertise of the two groups:  the US group will have primary                    responsibility for the electronics and the data acquisition                     systems, while the French will be responsible for the engineering,              fabrication, and assembly of the detector and for the design of                 the trigger logic.",
