Under the stewardship of Dr. Douglas S. Jones, the                invertebrate fossil collections have been the subject of renewed                interest and significant support.  This fossil collection now                   represents one of the fastest-growing repositories of                           invertebrate fossils in the country, and will soon become the                   premiere repository for marine invertebrates of Cenozoic age from               the southeast U.S. and the Caribbean Ocean.  Dr. Jones proposes                 transfer of the collection to high-density storage units, and                   acceleration of the efforts to arrange, catalog, and computerize                the collection's holdings.                                                           The proposed curatorial improvement project will have wide-                ranging benefits for the research community.  Researchers will                  have improved access to the collections during their visits to                  Gainesville, and through a more effective program of borrowing                  specimens.  The computer database will be a research resource in                its own right, allowing investigators to explore patterns of                    fossil distribution through time and space.  Natural history                    collections such as this are the primary documents of the                       evolution of life on earth.  The research community realizes                    important dividends from their proper curation.",
