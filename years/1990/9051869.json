 "awd_abstract_narration": "This community college is purchasing equipment to conduct studies               on water quality of a local lake as the major focus of an                       Environmental Biology course and as an integral part of the                     curriculum in other biology and chemistry courses at the                        institution.  The goal of the project is to spark interest in                   science while teaching basic scientific knowledge and research                  skills.  The lake was chosen as a research focus because of its                 declining condition, which is a concern for students and the                    community as a whole.  Students are developing projects to be                   carried out with the requested equipment in:  1. water quality                  studies, 2. algae studies, 3. bacterial studies, 4. environmental               growth studies.  The equipment includes water testing kits and                  sampling equipment, a spectrophotometer, video microscope system,               culturing equipment, and computing equipment with interface and                 sensors.  The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
