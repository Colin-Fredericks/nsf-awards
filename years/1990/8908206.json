 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Mr. Christopher A.                       Shiyam, a Nigerian graduate student at the State University                     of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry,                      to pursue dissertation research in Nigeria under the                            direction of Dr. Richard C. Smardon, his faculty advisor,                       on the barriers to coastal environmental information                            transfer in Nigeria.  A study will be made in Nigeria on                        coastal environmental problems, the status of the                               environmental information system, a methodology for                             identifying barriers to information transfer from research                      to policy, and information utilization by decision makers.                      Guidelines for integrating coastal environmental                                information into the decision-making process in Nigeria                         will be developed.                                                                                                                                              In contrast to the industrialized nations, Nigeria, like                        most other developing countries, lacks the data and                             information infrastructure as well as the legal structure                       for the systematic collection and use of environmental                          information.  The absence of information and barriers to                        information flow and use are impediments to integrated                          resource management in Nigeria.  This research is designed                      to determine how scientific knowledge influences the                            decision-making process.  A survey will be undertaken to                        determine how Nigerian research staff members perceive the                      role of coastal environmental information in decision                           making and barriers to information flow and use.  This                          project is relevant to the objectives of the Science in                         Developing Countries Program which makes small grants that                      are intended to advance the international exchange of                           scientific knowledge and to contribute to the scientific                        infrastructure of developing countries.  Developing-country                     graduate students who are enrolled at U.S. universities may                     receive support to engage in research on a                                      developing-country problem.  Mr. Shiyam has served as a                         research officer, Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria,                       Jos, Nigeria, and is highly qualified to undertake this                         dissertation research project with his faculty advisor.",
