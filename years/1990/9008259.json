The goal of the research is to obtain definite                                  results for Risk Sensitive LQG control for                                      systems defined on an infinite time interval                                    and to establish the relationship between the                                   resulting design and existing designs for                                       linear systems.                                                                 The main themes of the research include an                                      analysis of the large deviations properties of                                  the Risk Sensitive LQG cost functional, design                                  of optimal stationary Risk Sensitive LQG                                        controllers for completely and partially                                        observed systems, analytical evaluation of the                                  relationship between Risk Sensitive LQG                                         control and H-infinity control and the                                          application of stationary Risk Sensitive LQG                                    control to important physical control problems                                  such as telescope pointing, robot arm pointing                                  and airplane landing.                                                           The research is expected to result in a new                                     design methodology for linear stationary                                        stochastic systems that has improved noise                                      rejection capabilities as compared to the                                       standard LQG design.  An additional potential                                   benefit is a new viewpoint from which the                                       important H-infinity design methodology can be                                  evaluated.",
