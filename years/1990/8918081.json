 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses supercomputing aspects in reacting flows.               It is well known that the success of computational fluid dynamics               hinges on efficient numerical methods and data management on the                supercomputer.  This is particularly true when complicated                      physical phenomena such as turbulence, shock waves, and reacting                flows are involved.  The emphasis in this research will be placed               on supercomputing aspects such as multigrid adaptive methods,                   unstructured grids, vector processing, and parallel processing.                 The best features of finite differences and finite element will                 be investigated, although emphasis is on finite elements due to                 an advantage in unstructured grids.  With the most rigorous                     supercomputing capabilities available, our efforts will then be                 centered on evaluation and development of numerical strategies in               dealing with widely disparate length and time scales typical of                 turbulence and reating flows.  The end product is to achieve an                 enhanced understanding of the physics of turbulent flow phenomena               in general and combustion of propulsion systems in particular.",
