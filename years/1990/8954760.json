The newsletter,                  already received by over 18,000 educators, contains application,                hands.on materials for the usage of calculators and appropriate                 technologies, classroom.ready pull.out section of useful and fun                materials, and articles assisting the elementary school teacher                 to relate important skills in estimation and number sense.  The                 newsletter will feature ideas and articles by will.known                        educators as well as serve as a forum for materials developed                   through National Science Foundation elementary materials                        projects.  The second year of the project will be devoted to                    developing self.sustaining resources for the publication,                       enabling COMAP to continue publication after NSF funding has                    ceased.  Estimates place circulation at 40,000 per issue within                 two years.",
