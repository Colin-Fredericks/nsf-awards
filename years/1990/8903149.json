 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Dynamics Program will support Professor William J.                  le Noble's study of \"Electronically Driven Stereogenesis\" in                    the Chemistry Department at the State University of New York at                 Stony Brook.  He will explore the principle that bond formation                 at trigonal carbon and bond cleavage at tetragonal carbon are                   favored in face selectivity on that side which has the most                     electron-rich sigma  bond in the antiperiplanar position.                                                                                                       In this project, Professor le Noble  is pursuing three major                    areas of research that will exploit unique advantages of                        2,5-disubstituted adamantanes as probes to study                                stereoelectronic effects in diastereofacial selection.  One                     area of study will involve examination of the scope of a simple                 rule according to which bond formation (addition reactions:                     electrophilic addition, nucleophilic addition, pericyclic                       reactions, etc.) at trigonal carbon and bond cleavage                           (decarboxylation, fragmentation, solvolysis, etc.) at                           tetragonal carbon occur at that face which has the most                         electron rich bond antiperiplanar.  The rigidity of the                         adamantane skeleton guarantees that no rotational motion will                   shroud the observed face selection in conformational                            uncertainty.  Another area of study deals with the transfer of                  chirality, and the third area deals with the kinetic studies of                 solvolysis of 2- and 5-tosyl adamantanes.",
