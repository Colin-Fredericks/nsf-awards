 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This proposal supports a collaborative project                    by Drs. H.W. Hiser and T.N. Veziroglu of the University of                      Miami, Coral Gables, Florida and Drs. M.G. Srinivas, and G.T.                   Marathe of the Indian Institute of Technology of Bombay,                        India.  They plan to conduct a theroetical and experimental                     study of water run-off estimations using data developed from                    remote sensing systems.  The reliablity of a water estimation                   study depends on the accuracy of estimates of rainfall and                      the loss of water before it joins a main stream.                                Surface-based digitized radar systems and geostationary                         satellite systems have the capability to provide more                           complete and accurate data. A watershed model will be                           developed using digitized radar systems at the University of                    Miami and geostationary satellite data obtained from NOAA as                    the rainfall data to the model.  Raingage data available in                     Florida will be used for ground truth of the remote-sensed                      rainfall data.  The results will be tested in India.  Data                      will be obtained from the radar system at Madras, India.                        Landsat data will be available form both U.S. and Indian                        geostationary satellites.                                                       Scope:  The study seeks to: develop an improved model for                       estimating the run-off water by taking into account                             precipitation, evapotranspiration and infiltration, as well                     as the location, land cover, land form and drainage form, as                    function of time, through utilizing remote sensing data;                        verify the model calculations against observational data                        gathered in India; refine the model and apply it to selected                    regions in India.  The development of reliable watershed                        run-off model based on testing and research in the two                          countries under vastly different conditions should produce a                    model of wider applicability leading to more efficient and                      safer water run-off management around the world.  Correct                       estimation of rain water run-off is of importance to the                        United States, which has the highest per capita water                           consumption, and India, which has one of the largest, and                       high density, populations in the world.
