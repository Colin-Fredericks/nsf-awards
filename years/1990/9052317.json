 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is the improvement of facilities for                   analyzing compounds and mixtures in the chemistry department.                   The improvement is occurring in conjunction with changes in the                 chemistry curriculum that expose chemistry students to modern                   instrumental techniques and real-world problems much earlier in                 their college experience.  A mass-selective detector for the                    department's capillary gas chromatograph is being used for                      demonstrations at the freshman level to generate student interest               in chemistry.  In later organic and analytical chemistry courses,               students are using the GC-MS to solve increasingly challenging                  problems.  Seniors in these fields of chemistry, as well as the                 departments of environmental science and biology, are using the                 GC-MS to perform original research as part of the required, year-               long senior research project.  With the availability of the GC-                 MS, seniors are tackling a wider range of research problems, and                their results are more accurate and meaningful.                                                                                                                 The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
