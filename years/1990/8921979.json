 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is in support of the second Greenland Ice Sheet                      Project (GISP II).  Large meteoritic impacts probably exert                     important modifications of global climates and ecosystems,                      but the size and frequency of these events is not well                          established.  Polar ice cores preserve a record of the                          accretion of materials from the solar system.  The element                      iridium which is highly enriched in extraterrestrial debris                     relative to crustal materials, has been determined in                           Antarctic ice as a measure of the steady state cosmic                           debris influx, and a pulse of cosmic iridium has been                           reported to coincide with the 1908 Tunguska impact event.                       It is likely that many events of Tunguska magnitude should                      be preserved in a 250,000 year ice core.  A complete record                     of Ir in a long polar ice core would allow determination of                     the size-frequency history of previous cosmic impacts.  It                      would also determine whether the more uniform background                        influx of small particles is truly constant.  Variation of                      the osmium isotope ratio will be used to distinguish cosmic                     (or mantle-derived) Os from meteorite Os.  These studies                        will be undertaken as an ancillary part of the ongoing GISP                     II ice core program.",
