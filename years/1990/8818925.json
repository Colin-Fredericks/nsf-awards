 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years the availability of new detectors, especially                   charge-coupled detectors (CCDs), on large telescopes has made                   possible more detailed and revealing studies of quasi-stellar                   objects (QSOs) and related galaxies than was possible in the                    past.  For the first time observers have begun to see extensive                 interactions between theoreticists and observers concerning the                 nature of the central energy sources.  In the past, the major                   connection between theoretical work and observational results had               been in the area of modeling the emission line regions, but                     recent observational work has provided more information about the               nature of the central objects themselves.  For example,                         considerable effort has been spent on understanding the continuum               energy distribution in terms of the radiation expected from an                  accretion disk.                                                                                                                                                 Recently, researchers have taken another approach to obtaining                  observational insights into the structure of active galaxies and                QSOs:  the use of spectropolarimetry and imaging polarimetry to                 derive information not obtainable by conventional spectroscopic                 methods.  In the past four years a new polarimeter which uses a                 CCD for a detector and has been put into a operation and the                    performance has been excellent.  This new spectropolarimeter will               be used to conduct observations of QSOs and related galaxies.",
