 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research permits Dr. Minze Stuiver, together with colleagues               from other laboratories, to conduct radiocarbon determinations on               a series of German and Irish oak trees, which date from between                 ca. 5,000 and 8,000 B.C.  The absolute ages of tree rings within                this sample are independently determined through the construction               of an annual ring chronology which starts at the present and                    works back into the past.  With these new determinations, Dr.                   Stuiver will construct a series of calibrations which will allow                the accurate conversion of radio carbon years into true age.                    Although the two are closely correlated they are not identical.                 Using this technique calibrations have been established from the                present back to 5,000 B.C., and this project will extend this by                approximately another 3,000 years.                                                                                                                              Because of the complicated relationship between \"radiocarbon age\"               and \"true age,\" sometimes materials with different true ages can                give the same radiocarbon age.  At some radiocarbon ages, the                   possible range of true ages can be smaller and at others larger.                For archaeologists these discrepancies can be extremely important               when comparisons are made from one culture area to another.  For                the more recent period, Dr. Stuiver's calibration curve allows                  one to correct for this, and it is important that this be                       extended further back in time.                                                                                                                                  This research is important not only to archaeologists but to                    astronomers and geophysicists, since the data provides                          information about changes in both solar radiation and in the                    earth's magnetic field.",
