 "awd_abstract_narration": "In all mammalian species, reproductive success is critically dependant          upon normal function of the ovary.  Normal ovarian function serves two          purposes, production of the oocyte, and appropriate production and              secretion of specific steroid and protein hormones.  In the mammalian           ovary, the oocyte is encased in several layers of cells which secrete           the female sex steroid hormone estrogen.  At ovualation, the oocyte is          extruded from the ovary and the cells which previously surrounded the           oocyte are changed into a structure called the corpus luteum.  The              cells of the corpus luteum, the luteal cells, secrete the female sex            steroid hormone, progesterone.  The secretion of progesterone from the          corpus luteum in the proper amounts for the proper time period is               required for successful reproduction.  Thus, progesterone secretion             from the corpus luteum is a critical determinant of reproductive                success.  The cells of the corpus luteum must respond, through                  biochemical mechanisms, to blood born hormonal substances which control         the normal secretion of progesterone.  The specific biochemical                 mechanisms which allow the luteal to respond to those hormones which            control progesterone secretion are at present unknown.  It is, in fact,         these mechanisms that are responsible for normal luteal function.                                                                                               Dr. Goldsmith has recently discovered that, in the rat, the expression          of a particular gene, the K-ras gene, increases greatly at the same             time that the seretion of progesterone from the corpus luteum is at its         maximum.  Furthermore, when an antibody against the protein coded for           by this gene was incorporated into luteal cells in vitro, progesterone          secretion from these cells was significantly decreased, thus                    demonstrating that the protein encoded by the K-ras gene, the p21               protein, plays a role in the production/secretion of progesterone by            the luteal cell.  It is the objective of this proposal to determine the         specific way in which the p21 protein affects luteal progesterone               secretion and whether the p21 protein plays a role in the secretion of          other hormones from the corpus luteum.  The K-ras gene product, the p21         protein, is present in all mammalian cells.  Thus, the results of the           proposed studies will have a significant impact upon the understanding          of ovarian hormone secretory mechanisms as well as our understanding of         the ways in which all mammalian cells respond to hormones and growth            factors.",
