 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research by The Johns Hopkins University in the St.                 Mary River and Willow Creek formation of northwestern Montana has               contributed important information about dinosaur faunas from                    upper coastal plain environments not otherwise available from                   most other regions that have yielded Late Cretaceous faunas.                    These new data are critical to the larger issues of their effects               on extinction and speciation of large-bodied terrestrial                        vertebrates.                                                                         Further field and laboratory work is essential for a better                understanding of the faunal components of this upper coastal                    plain habitat and the effects of severe reduction in terrestrial                environments through marine transgressions (i.e. habitat                        bottlenecks) and their release.  With these goals in mind, the                  field work will be devoted to collecting specimens, mapping                     localities and detailing the stratigraphy of the St. Mary River                 and Willow Creek sites.  Laboratory research will focus on the                  paleoecologic and evolutionary interpretation of the St. Mary                   River fauna necessary for a critical understanding of these                     habitat bottlenecks.  This work includes 1) new approaches to the               analysis of ontogenetic stages and evolution of St. Mary River                  taxa using landmark-based morphometrics, 2) new analyses of the                 feeding and locomotion of the St. Mary River animals on the                     kinematics of the jaws and teeth, and the kinematics and cross-                 sectional geometry of the limbs, and 3) interpretation of these                 data in terms of the evolutionary dynamics of St. Mary River taxa               to the opening of terrestrial habitats through the regression of                the Bearpaw Sea.                                                                     This study will fill a significant void in our knowledge of                an important component of Late Cretaceous ecosystems (life in                   upper coastal plain environments) at a time critical to the                     history of dinosaurs and other vertebrates (the Edmontonian Land                Mammal Age at the close of the Cretaceous).  In doing so, it will               contribute to our understanding of how major environmental crises               such as extensive transgressions and regressions relate to the                  evolutionary dynamics of large-bodied vertebrates.",
