 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Eugene Giles, Ms. Jolee West, a                      graduate student at the University of Illinois at Urbana, will                  conduct research for her doctoral dissertation.  She will combine               field and laboratory work to study the distribution of reptilian                remains - crocodile and turtle - on the East African landscape                  and determine the causal factors of the patterns observed.  In                  particular, she wishes to learn how humanly derived assemblages                 may be identified.  To accomplish this, she will first focus her                attention on areas located on the Eastern shore of Lake Turkana,                Kenya which are not inhabited by people.  She will establish                    transects which extend away from water sources and collect                      reptilian remains along them.  This will provide data on                        \"natural\" or non-human patterning.  She will then work with                     traditional peoples who live near the lake margin and hunt and                  butcher these same species.  A comparison of these samples should               permit identification of uniquely human signatures.  Ms. West                   will also examine reptile remains from hyena lairs, study bone                  weathering, and conduct flume experiments to show the                           differential effects of water movement.                                                                                                                         This basic research will provide archaeologists with extremely                  valuable data.  Crocodile and turtle remains are often recovered                during the excavation of early hominid sites in East Africa.                    However, it is extremely difficult to determine the derivation of               these remains which also occur naturally as a scatter across                    African landscapes.  It is not possible therefore to tell whether               such species formed part of early hominid diet or whether the                   association of these bones occurs by chance.  Ms. West's project                will provide the key for such interpretation.                                                                                                                   This project is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  provide a tool of use in a wide range of archaeological                         situations.  Secondly, it will assist in the training of an                     extremely promising young scientist.",
