 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports collaboration in astrochemistry between                     Professors William M. Irvine, Paul F. Goldsmith, and F. Peter                   Schloerb, of the University of Massachusetts; and Professor Shuji               Saito, Nagoya University, Japan, as well as other Japanese                      investigators at Nagoya University, Toyama University, and the                  Nobeyama Radio Observatory.  The researchers will cooperate in                  several studies aimed at increasing understanding of the chemical               composition and processes in interstellar molecular clouds, using               the techniques of high-frequency radio astronomy and modern                     laboratory molecular spectroscopy.  The laboratory work will be                 carried out primarily in the Department of Astrophysics at the                  University of Nagoya, while astronomical observations will be made              at the Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory (FCRAO), which is               operated by the University of Massachusetts, and at the Nobeyama                Radio Observatory.                                                                                                                                              Chemistry plays an increasingly well-recognized role in the study               of important astronomical environments, including the interstellar              molecular clouds where stars are believed to form, the envelopes                expelled by both young and evolved stars, and cometary comae.  In               this project, the strengths of three research facilities are                    brought together, one in the U.S. and two in Japan.  Both the U.S.              and Japanese investigators bring significant experience and                     expertise in astrochemistry to this effort.  The 14-meter diameter              radio telescope of the FCRAO is the largest single-dish millimeter              wavelength telescope in North America.  Used in conjunction with                various state-of-the-art receivers developed at FCRAO, it provides              extremely high sensitivity in several spectral frequency regions                of interest in these studies.  The 45-meter radio telescope at                  Nobeyama is the largest radio telescope in the world for                        observations at millimeter wavelengths, and so offers the highest               resolution at these wavelengths available with any single dish                  antenna.  Members of the Molecular Spectroscopy Group in the                    Department of Astrophysics at Nagoya are among world leaders in                 the laboratory study of highly reactive, unstable molecular                     species.  Cooperation among these three groups has existed for                  several years, and this award will permit the collaboration to be               strengthened and expanded.  Specific projects proposed for study                include spectral surveys of cold, quiescent interstellar clouds to              better determine their chemical composition, investigations of                  possible molecular formation or equilibration on interstellar                   grains, studies of the degree of chemical saturation in different               environments, and determination of the relative abundance of                    closely related molecular species in order to investigate reaction              pathways.",
