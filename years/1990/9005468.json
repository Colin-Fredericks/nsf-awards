 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past several years Dr. Grainger has been investigating               the mechanisms of determination of the lens during embryogenesis.               This system provides an excellent general model for the study of                vertebrate cell determination because it has been possible to                   carefully study all of the stages of the determination process.                 This process has been found to require several inductive                        interactions, and recent evidence argues that lens determination                is tightly coupled to formation of the eye rudiment during                      gastrulation. This finding has prompted the initiation of studies               on eye formation as a complement to work on lens induction. In                  this proposal experiments are described to continue analysis of                 gene regulation in this system, addressing three levels of gene                 expression that are important in lens and eye formation in                      Xenopus, from terminal differentiation to the initial stages of                 determination. First, the regulation of cell type specific                      proteins in these two tissues will be examined: primarily                       crystallin gene regulation in the lens and opsin gene regulation                in the eye rudiment. Second, several cDNA screening procedures                  will be pursued for identifying gene products which may regulate                the early stages of lens and eye determination, or which may                    serve as markers of these early stages. Characterization of                     several gene products which have already been identified in these               screens will continue. Finally, an experimental approach is                     proposed for identifying gene products that may control the very                precisely regulated ability, or competence, of ectoderm to                      respond to inductive signals that initiate the events lens and                  eye determination. While evidence has been accumulating about the               molecular genetic controls which govern organization of many                    regions of the vertebrate embryo, there is virtually no                         information about how the eye and lens regions are established                  early in development. A long range goal is to construct and test                models for these early processes.",
