 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unlike well studied bacteria such as Eschericia coli, the                       membrane potential of Spirochaeta aurantia is involved in                       chemotaxis.  Furthermore the flagellar filaments of the                         spirochete periplasmic flagella are relatively complex when                     compared with the exoflagella of other bacteria.  The goal of the               proposed research is to understand the molecular basis of the                   mechanisms of motility and chemotaxis unique to spirochetes.                    Genes required for motility will be cloned and analyzed.  A                     considerable effort toward developing a gene transfer system for                this organisms will be mounted.  The immediate use of such a                    system will be in studies of spirochete motility and chemotaxis.                Techniques for studying ionic channels in the membranes of S.                   aurantia will be developed with an ultimate goal of identifying                 chemoeffector-regulated channels.                                                                                                                               Spirochetes are motile bacteria that have periplasmic flagella                  rather than exoflagella.  Cells exhibit smooth swimming,                        reversals of cell orientation and flexing.  At least some                       spirochetes also can \"crawl\" on solid surfaces.  The peculiar                   mechanism of spirochete motility is important to the success of                 these organisms in the viscous environments in which they trive.                The proposed research will employ Spirochaeta aurantia as a model               in studies of motility and chemotaxis of spirochetes and in the                 development of techniques generally useful for studies of                       spirochetes.  The results of this research should provide new                   information concerning the relationship of the unique spirochete                motility system to their behavior.",
