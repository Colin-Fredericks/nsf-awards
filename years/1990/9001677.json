 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in combinatorics and                      number theory of Professor Wen-Ching Li of The Pennsylvania State               University. Dr. Li's project is centered on questions relating                  modular forms to graph theory. Among the questions she will                     investigate are: to realize certain Ramanujan graphs as quotients               of trees associated to projective linear groups over p-adic                     fields; to continue her collaboration with Dr. F.K. Hwang of                    Bell Laboratories on generalized double loop networks; and to                   study the Galois structure of p-Sylow subgroups of ideal class                  groups.                                                                              Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots. The work of Professor               Li is in this tradition, but extends beyond the traditional                     boundaries of the theory of modular forms in a particularly                     interdisciplinary thrust.",
