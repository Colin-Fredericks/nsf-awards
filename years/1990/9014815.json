 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Robert Blumenschine, Professor of                    Anthropology at Rutgers University, Ms. Marie Selvaggio will                    conduct actualistic studies in the Serengeti region of Northern                 Tanzania.  The data thus collected will provide the basis for her               doctoral dissertation.  Following an already completed pilot                    study, she will collect information on carnivore modification of                bone.  The results will be of direct use in interpreting                        archaeological assemblages.  Ms. Selvaggio will collect bones                   from observed carnivore kills after the predators have abandoned                them.  She will analyze these to take into account the species of               both prey and carnivore, as well as the position and nature of                  bone modification.  She will attempt to collect a large series                  which includes actions by all the major predators.                                                                                                              On this basis, it will be possible to examine important                         archaeological assemblages from East Africa to determine the                    extent to which they have resulted from human, as opposed to                    carnivore, activity.  In recent years, archaeologists have                      strongly disagreed about the role of hunting in the development                 of human society.  It has been argued that faunal assemblages                   found with early stone tools represent not hunting - as formerly                believed - but rather human scavenging from carnivore kills.  It                has proven extremely difficult to decide between these                          alternatives, and actualistic work, such as that which Ms.                      Selvaggio will undertake, should serve to provide a needed                      interpretive context.                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  It will help to                develop a methodological tool which will be applicable to many                  sites in different parts of the world.  It will ultimately                      increase our understanding of how humans developed and, finally,                will assist in the training of an extremely promising scientist.",
