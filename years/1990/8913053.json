 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adsorption of proteins at fluid interfaces play a vital                         role in many biological, chemical and biotechnological                          processes.  However, the molecular mechanism of adsorption                      of proteins is not well understood.  Specifically, the                          fundamental questions that need to be investigated are:                         what are the molecular forces responsible for adsorption                        and retention of proteins at fluid interfaces and how                           these forces are affected by the protein conformation and                       what is the role of bulk water structure in this vital                          transport process?  Thus, the focus of the proposed                             research is to elucidate: 1.  the influence of protein                          conformation, molecular flexibility and the bulk water                          structure on adsorption at interfaces; 2.  the                                  conformation of proteins in the adsorbed state and its                          relation to their surface properties; 3.  the additivity                        of polar and apolar groups of peptides on the kinetics and                      thermodynamics of adsorption at interfaces.                                                                                                                     The fundamental information obtained from this study will                       not only enhance understanding of macromolecular                                adsorption processes, but also will facilitate development                      of genetic engineering approaches to improve the surface                        properties of biologically and technologically important                        proteins.",
