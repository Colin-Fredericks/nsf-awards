 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern communication systems, for examples high speed pulse code                transmission systems via satellite, impose a wide frequency band                over which pulse amplitude and phase distortion must be contained               within acceptable limits to preserve the integrity of the output                information.  The system includes many components whose mismatch,               e.g. amplifiers with their fixed parasitic elements, contribute to              the degradation of wide band response.  Broadband equalizers must               be properly inserted along the system to compensate for these                   inevitable mismatches that occur over the band so as to maintain                low levels of distortion.                                                                                                                                       This research deals with three difficult and important problems in              broadband matching which are especially (though not exclusively)                applicable to distributed gain-bandwidth (GBW) theory of linear                 passive and active 2-ports which arises in such applications as FET             amplifiers where loss and internal feedback are included.                       Heretofore no complete analytic solution of this problem has been               presented.  The second considers new broadband matching methods                 which could give a practical approach to matching loads which are               badly mismatched and/or have widely fluctuating input impedances                as a function of frequency.  Microwave antennas, microwave to                   optical device coupling structures, and microwave FET amplifiers                including the parasitic elements due to packaging as well as those              of the intrinsic device are typical applications.  The third                    problem concerns gain-bandwidth performance and the design of                   coupling structures for multi-device distributed amplifiers using               realistic models for the active devices.",
