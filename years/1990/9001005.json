 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Hampshire will connect their campus               network to the New England Academic and Research Network                        (NEARnet), a regional network which is part of the NSFNET.                      Direct connection to NEARnet will provide researchers with                      improved access to the Internet and other national networks such                as CSNET/Bitnet and USENET.  The proposed 56,000 bit per second,                dedicated, communication link will improve reliability, speed,                  turn.around, and flexibility for data communication functions                   such as file transfer, remote login, and teleconferencing.                      NEARnet will provide for equipment, maintenance, and information                services.                                                                               The University of New Hampshire will be able to integrate               supercomputing and collaborative research into graduate and                     udergraduate curricula.  In addition to the main campus at                      Durham, Keene State College, Plymouth State College, and the                    State Department of Education will be offered connectivity                      through already existing local networks.  This project thus                     provides sharing of resources among the state institutions,                     greatly facilitates research by students and faculty, and                       provides a valuable resource to supplement course work.",
