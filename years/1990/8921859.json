 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program is concerned with metal phosphorus compounds                  with layered structures containing cavities which may be                        exploited for catalysis or in chemical separations. These                       compounds are related structurally to the zeolites which are                    used extensively in water purification and as industrial                        catalysts or catalyst supports.                                                                                                                                 A variety of metal organophosphates and phosphonates with                       layered structures will be synthesized and characterized.                       Metals will be chosen with valences ranging from 2+ to 4+, and                  mixed valence compounds will be prepared also. Functionalized                   derivatives in which the pendant organic groups contain amino,                  carboxlylic or sulfonic acid groups, or with polyether or                       polyamine chains as pendant groups, will be prepared. Bridging                  by polyether or polyamine chains is expected to yield                           cryptand-like structures, whereas bridging by biphenyls is                      expected to yield thermally stable structures. The                              organophosphonates will be decomposed thermally in an attempt                   to produce novel inorganic layered phosphates, and will be                      subjected to controlled hydrolysis to prepare new layered                       hydroxides and oxides. Applications of the new materials in                     catalysis, ion exchange and specific sorption will be examined.                 For example, the role of Lewis acid versus Bronsted acid sites                  in acid catalyzed reactions will be assessed.",
