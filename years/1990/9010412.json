 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automatic garbage collection enhances programmer productivity by                eliminating many of the low-level concerns associated with explicit             reclamation of dynamic objects, by protecting programmers from having           to deal with subtle bugs that result from dangling pointer problems, and        by allowing programmers to select simple algorithms that might otherwise        be rejected because of the perceived complexity of managing the dynamic         creation and destruction of many short-lived objects.  The research             pursued in this project focuses on:                                                                                                                             - generalization of an existing real-time garbage collection algorithm          to deal effectively with arbitrarily long strings of characters and with        arbitrarily long arrays of pointers to other objects.  Overlapping              substrings and array slices would also be supported.                                                                                                            - design and prototype implementation of a CPU-independent memory module        that executes the generalized real-time garbage collection algorithm in         parallel hardware while application programs run on the host CPU.                                                                                               - analytical and empirical evaluation of software and hardware                  prototypes to determine worst-case and average performance of particular        memory management operations.                                                                                                                                   - development of general techniques to help programmers analyze their           real-time programs in order to p\u0131lace upper bounds on the programs'             memory requirement and on the times required to perform particular              memory operations.",
