 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single crystal X-ray crystallography is the most powerful                       analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                    synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                   chemistry, single crystal X-ray diffraction is an invaluable tool               to characterize molecular structure.  The information gained from               the knowledge of the intermolecular composition and structure                   helps to develop new reactions of potentially general interest in               catalysis or organic synthesis.                                                                                                                                 This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program will               help the Department of Chemistry at the University of California                in Berkeley, upgrade the existing X-ray facility.   Among the                   areas of chemical research that will be enhanced by the                         acquisition are following:                                                                                                                                      o    X-Ray Crystallography in Organic Synthesis                                                                                                                 o    Structure-Based Design and Evaluation of Protein Ligands                                                                                                   o    X-Ray Diffraction as Tool in Studies of the Reactions of                        Organometallic Complexes                                                                                                                                   o    Studies of Transition Metal Oxides and Phosphides                                                                                                          o    Accurate Structure Analysis as a Probe of Bonding                               interactions in Organometallic Compounds                                                                                                                   o    Bioinorganic Chemistry",
