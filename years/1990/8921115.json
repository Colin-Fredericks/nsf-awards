 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Phase II SBIR project to develop a new type of                        isolation technique for reduction of structural response                        during earthquake excitations.  The new isolation system                        is known as the Friction Pendulum System (FPS) which uses                       steel connections to achieve a pendulum motion of the                           support structure in small amplitudes.  This concept                            represents a simple yet highly effective way for seismic                        isolation.                                                                                                                                                      Engineering and design considerations as identified in                          the Phase I research which was satisfactorily conducted,                        will be investigated.                                                                                                                                           Laboratory tests of prototype FPS isolators and building                        models will be carried out.  The effects of the unique                          and advantageous features of the FPS on building seismic                        response will be evaluated.  The applicability of the FPS                       to different types of new and existing buildings will be                        studied.                                                                                                                                                        The successful completion of this project will                                  demonstrate that the FPS can substantially improve the                          earthquake resistance of new and existing buildings,                            without an increase in costs.  Because of the inherent                          simplicity and versatility of the FPS concept, this new                         isolation system could become a major tool for the                              seismic resistant design of constructed facilities.",
