 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-year continuation of current research is proposed with               projects designed to uncover how variability, inheritance, and                  differential fitness affect the evolution of morphological                      variation within species of animals.  The polymorphic tiger                     salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum, will be a model to address three                questions.  1). Have changes in timing of development over                      evolutionary time affected the origin of morphological variation                within species?  2) Will simple extensions of genetic models                    describing continuous variation in species?  3) Is natural                      selection, especially through competition within species and                    predictability of the aquatic habitat, a force maintaining                      morphological variation within and between populations?  These                  questions relate to the general issue of how continuous                         morphological variation within a species is maintained or                       converted into discontinuous morphological variation within or                  between populations.                                                                 Questions will be studied using laboratory and field                       experiments and observations.  These include morphometric                       analyses of changes in size and shape as animals grow,                          complemented by descriptions of geographic variation in                         morphology.  Breeding experiments will quantify genetic and                     environmental contributions to morphological variation among                    populations.  Finally, several experiments are designed to                      provide a means for relating variation in anatomy, diet, and                    fitness.  Collectively, the research projects proposed contribute               to our developing understanding of the ecological and                           evolutionary processes relating variation within species and the                origin of novel evolutionary forms.",
