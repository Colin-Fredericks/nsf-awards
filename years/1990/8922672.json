 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                          Chemistry Program.  Dr. Matteson is developing new synthetic                    tools based upon the boron atom.  This technique provides an                    extremely powerful way of controlling the relative                              stereochemistry of parts of a complex molecule.  It will be                     very useful in preparing extremely pure pheromones needed in                    controlling insects.                                                                                                                                            Directed asymmetric synthesis based on boronic ester chemistry                  has been found to be applicable to a wide variety of problems                   in natural product synthesis, and the proposed project will                     extend our basic knowledge of boronic ester chemistry and                       extend its applicability to new types of synthetic problems.                    To demonstrate and refine the features of the method that are                   already known, synthesisof several chiral insect pheromones                     will be undertaken.  These provide significant but realistic                    synthetic challenges which will demonstrate some of the                         advantages of the approach, which is now theoretically capable                  of providing >1000:1 chiral isomer ratios of crude products                     The unequivocal stereochemistry and ability to produce all                      stereoisomers in highly pure form provided by this method                       should be useful for proving configurations of as yet unknown                   pheromones.  New boronic ester chemistry will be investigated                   which has as its goal the connection of boronic esters produced                 via this chemistry with molecular fragments which may be                        obtained by other means, so that this chemistry can be applied                  more readily to the synthesis of highly complex natural                         products.",
