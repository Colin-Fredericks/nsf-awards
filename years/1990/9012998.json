 "awd_abstract_narration": "Excavations by Dr. Alan Simmons and his colleagues at the site of               Akrotiri-Aetokremnos, located on the Akrotiri Peninsula of                      southern Cyprus, have greatly surprised both archaeologists and                 biologists, because they seem to indicate the co-occurrence of                  humans and pygmy forms of both hippopotamus and elephant.  Dated                to the ninth millennium BC, this stratified cave site contains                  both stone tools as well as the broken bones of both species.                   These data also indicate that human settlement of the eastern                   Mediterranean islands occurred ca. 2,000 years earlier than                     previously expected.  Evidence seems to indicate that a true                    association exists between the bones and stone tools.  This                     implies human hunting of these species and a probable human role                in their extinction.  In this project, Dr. Simmons and his                      colleagues will analyze the materials recovered during multiple                 seasons of field research.  Objectives include analysis of faunal               and material culture assemblages, of site geomorphology,                        stratigraphy and paleoenvironment, as well as refinement of the                 chronological sequence.                                                                                                                                         In many parts of the world the disappearance of many species of                 animals appears to be associated with human factors.                            Archaeologists and biologists have, for many years, argued about                the human role in the extinction of such large species as                       mammoths and mastodons in North America.  What makes the issue                  complicated is that these faunal changes occurred at the end of                 the last \"Ice Age,\" and it is difficult to separate out the                     potential climatic factor.  Therefore, researchers have turned                  their attention to other areas of the world.  It is in this                     context that the Cyprus case is of primary interest.  Through                   study of the cave sediments insight will be gained into climatic                change - or stability.  Analysis of bone breakage patterns will                 indicate how humans utilized and possibly killed these animals.                                                                                                 Given the serious problem of species loss today, this research is               important because it will set the issue into a broader                          chronological context.  It will also increase our understanding                 of early Mediterranean prehistory and help to document expanding                human capabilities there.",
