A frequency dependent correlation                  model for the support motions of the Bay Bridge, accounting                     for the effects of traveling waves, attenuation, propogation                    path, and local soil and geologic structures will be                            constructed and calibrated.  This function will be applied to                   the response spectrum analysis based on the principles of                       stochastic processes.                                                                                                                                           The new response spectrum method will be used to investigate                    the response of the Bay Bridge during the Loma Prieta                           earthquake and to determine the causes of its failure.                          Special emphasis will be given to determining the influence                     of differential support motions on the observed performance                     of the bridge.  The results from this anlysis will be compared                  with planned time-history analysis of the bridge by a separate                  research team at Berkeley, thus verifying the response                          spectrum method.  The method will then be used to predict the                   response of the Ba Bridge to a potential earthquake of large                    magnitude on San Andreas or Hayward faults.  This part will                     be carried out in parallel with other planned studies of the                    Bay Bridge at the Universit of California at Berkeley.                                                                                                          The investigation will advance the methodology for analyzing                    the bridge response to multiple-support seismic excitations.",
