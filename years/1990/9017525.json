 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbes that can couple their anaerobic growth to the reduction                of manganese(IV) and iron(III) have only recently been isolated                 and make it possible to investigate the physiology and                          biochemistry of the microbial processes responsible for the use                 of manganese(IV) and iron(III) as terminal electron acceptor for                anaerobic respiration.  These microbes may act as important                     biogeochemical agents for the cycling of these metals in aquatic                and soil environments.  The more immediate objectives of this                   project include the study of one such microbe, Shewanella                       (formerly Alteromonas) putrefaciens strain MR-1, including: (1)                 determination of the growth energetics when growth is coupled to                the reduction of manganese or iron, and comparison of these                     energetics to those involving the use of other electron                         acceptors(O2, nitrate, and fumarate); (2) determination and                     preliminary characterization of the electron transport components               involved in the respiratory reduction of these metals; and (3)                  purification and characterization the terminal reductases                       responsible for the reduction of these metals.                                                                                                                  Several aspects of this work form the foundation for its                        scientific rationale.  First, the ability of certain bacteria to                couple their growth to the dissolution of manganese and iron                    oxides represents a novel form of bacterial metabolism; this                    project uncovers aspects of bacterial physiology and biochemistry               heretofore unknown.  Gaining insight into these mechanisms                      broadens the current state of knowledge concerning anaerobic                    (i.e. oxygen-free) respiration, knowledge which is currently                    limited to studies of only a few bacteria.  Such versatility                    makes this bacterium a valuable model for studying the components               and regulation of oxygen-free respiration.  Thirdly, as this                    bacterium could make a significant contribution to the cycling of               manganese and iron in aquatic sediments and flooded soils,                      knowledge of its mechanisms of metal reduction enhances our                     understanding of the roles of metal-reducing bacteria in the                    environment.  Overall, the studies lead to new ways of thinking                 about oxygen-free respiration, as well as the environmental                     cycling of certain metals.",
