 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of Prof. Isenberg involves primarily two                      areas of study:  (1)  The dynamics of gravitational fields and                  their behavior near singularities in spacetimes satisfying                      Einstein's equations; and (2)  The convergence and                              nonconvergence of Ricci flows of Reimannian metrics on three-                   dimensional manifolds.  While the interest in the first area                    comes from physics and that in the second area is mathematical,                 in both areas the analysis focuses on geometrically-based                       systems of partial differential equations.  Moreover, in both,                  the most pressing (and difficult) issues involve the long-time                  behavior of the solutions, and the behavior of the fields as                    they become singular.  Therefore it is not surprising that the                  progress achieved in the two areas has been often based on the                  use of somewhat similar tools.  Also not surprising is the                      considerable cross-fertilization which has occurred between the                 physically-motivated ideas and mathematically-based concepts                    which are used in studying both problems.",
