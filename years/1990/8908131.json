 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most features of animals of interest to evolutionary                       biologists involve complex traits:  Sets or systems of                          interrelated aspects of the animal.  For example composed of a                  system of interrelated bones.  Most complex traits are influenced               by the environment in which they develop (called phenotypic                     plasticity); thus for example the development of the human hand                 may be influenced by the nutritional history of the individual.                 Despite the importance of such complex traits, little is known                  quantitatively of how natural selection acts on complex traits in               wild populations, or of consequences of phenotypic plasticity for               selection on such traits.                                                            The proposed research will study natural selection and                     phenotypic plasticity of one complex trait:  The wing                           pigmentation pattern of the butterfly, Pieris occidentalis.                     Using a series of field experiments in wild populations, the                    research will:  (1) measure natural selection on different                      aspects of wing pigment pattern, and how such selections may vary               seasonally; (2) determine whether selection is the result of the                effects of pigment pattern on body temperature regulation or on                 camouflage from potential predators; and (3) measure the                        selective consequences of phenotypic plasticity in wing pigment                 pattern.  These experiments will provide the first detailed case                study of the mechanisms and seasonal variation in natural                       selection for a complex, phenotypically-plastic trait.",
