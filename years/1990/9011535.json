 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single-chip processor speeds are increaasing at a tremendous rate,              providing raw processing power that is rapidly approaching that of              mainframe computers.  Unfortunately, external memory speeds are not             exhibiting the same high rate of increase, and in high-performance              single-chip processors external memory references are becoming a                serious performance bottleneck.  One way to reduce the impact of                memory latency on performance is to incorporate architectural I/O               queues between the processor and external memory.  Analysis of a                processor that employs such I/O queues (the PIPE processor) in its              processor-memory interface indicates that these queues can and do               provide significant performance improvements.  However, the studies             done so far have only looked at the effectiveness of I/O queues on              scientific programs.  The goal of this research is to more fully                evaluate the overall effectiveness of I/O queues by generating a wide           spectrum of benchmark programs and analyzing their execution on the             PIPE simulator.  These new benchmark programs will be produced by               either creating a new optimizing compiler for the PIPE architecture             that is capable of taking full advantage of the I/O queues, or by               modifying the output of the compiler written for the ZS-1, a                    commercially available product that employs architectural queues                similar to those used by the PIPE processor.",
