 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Gregory R. Stewart of the                         University of Florida to collaborate in research on the                         physics of heavy fermion systems with Professor Frank                           Steglich of the Institute for Nuclear Physics of the Technical                  University of Darmstadt, Federal Republic of Germany.  The                      collaborating laboratories bring substantially complementary                    experimental expertise to the proposed study of                                 \u001asuperconductivity in fermions.  Professor Steglich's group                     discovered the first heavy fermion \u001asuperconductor.  They                       have considerable expertise and collective knowledge in                         specific heat, critical fields, thermal expansion, and                          thermopower and in working with very low temperatures (0.050                    Kelvin.)  The University of Florida group offers substantial                    strengths in Uranium.Beryllium13 (UBe.13) sample preparation                    and studies of small mass.specific heat in high magnetic                        fields.                                                                                                                                                         Heavy fermion systems display anomalously large specific                        heats at low temperatures which, when coupled with their                        nearness to magnetic behavior, makes the occurrence of                          superconductivity in these Cesium and Uranium based compounds                   unexpected.  The collaborating research groups will study the                   nature of the superconducting pairing and the relationship                      between normal state properties and superconductivity.  They                    will build on their recent breakthrough in understanding the                    source of the normal state high effective mass in UBe.13, in                    order to explore possible implications for superconductivity.                   Advances in understanding heavy fermion electron systems may                    have long term applications in magnetism and superconductivity                  based on their unusual properties and their similarities in                     some respects to high temperature superconductors.",
