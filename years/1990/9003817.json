 "awd_abstract_narration": "The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine in plants has been                         thought to occur primarily through phosphorylation of                           choline, followed by conversion to CDPcholine, and then                         transfer of a phosphatidate group to the choline to give the                    final lipid product.  An alternate pathway has been proposed                    which involves three sequential methylations, utilizing S-                      adenosyl-L-methionine, of the amino group of                                    phosphatidylethanolamine.  Recent research has indicated that                   in some tissues, such as castor bean endosperm, the choline                     produced from a commonly assumed precursor, L-serine, may not                   be available for phosphatidylcholine synthesis.  In addition,                   evidence now is available that in several tissues                               phosphatidylethanolamine does not act as a substrate for                        methylation, unlike the case in yeast and mammalian tissues.                    Thus, either plants differ in some respects from yeast and                      mammalian systems in the exact pathways of methylation and                      their regulation, or some aspects of the methylation scheme                     have not been detected and examined in these other systems.                     The goals of this proposal are to examine these newly                           described initial methylation enzymes in detail, to try to                      determine a source of choline for the nucleotide (CDP-                          derivative) pathway (and for regulation of the functioning of                   the methylation pathway), and to continue our investigations                    into the enzymes of the nucleotide pathway.  We will                            characterize the methylation enzymes, work on their                             purifications, and test for regulation through allosteric                       and/or membrane-enzyme interactions as well as                                  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation.  Various plant organs,                       particularly leaves and roots, will be tested for a capacity                    to synthesize and export choline or choline-P.                                                                                                                  Phospholipids are important components of membranes of all                      living organisms.  They play crucial structural and metabolic                   role; yet their pathways of synthesis are incompletely known,                   especially in plants.  This project affords the opportunity                     to elucidate important pathways of phospholipid synthesis and                   regulation in a model plant system.***//",
