The                   program seeks to enable US scientists and engineers to                          conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or                             complimentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions                 in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                           This award will support a 12 month visit by Dr. Robert D.                       Tilton to go to Sweden to work with Dr. Per Claesson of the                     Institute for Surface Chemistry on \"A Study of Adsorbed                         Protein Interactions Using the Surface Force Apparatus.\"  Dr.                   Tilton plans to use the surface force apparatus to measure                      the force-distance relationships characterizing the                             intermolecular interactions experienced by adsorbed proteins.                   With this recently developed technique, forces as small as                      10-to-the-minus-7 N are measured between opposing crossed                       mica cylinders at separations resolvable to less than 1nm.                      The extreme sensitivity of the surface force apparatus makes                    it useful in the study of the forces that govern the behavior                   of molecular and colloidal systems.  This approach is                           especially useful to characterize non-DLVO forces, such as                      repulsive hydration and attractive hydrophobic forces, that                     are important in biological and colloidal systems.  Use of                      the surface force apparatus to quantitatively study the                         character of the interactions of adsorbed proteins with                         surfaces and with other biomolecules will improve our                           understanding of the basic phenomena driving protein                            adsorption, and thus will assist in the development of                          materials that contact the biological environment.                                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
