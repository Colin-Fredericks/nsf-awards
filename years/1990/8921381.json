 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of olefin polymerization processes are cataytic,                   most often involving a heterogeneous catalyst.  The                             polymerization reaction occurs at some active site on the                       catalyst either on its surface or within its pores.  This                       means that monomer has to contact the catalyst and that the                     polymer grows either on the surface or within the pores of the                  catalyst.  The transport processes involved include monomer                     from the bulk phase diffusing through a polymer layer to an                     acitve site and the heat of reaction(the reactions are                          exothermic) diffusing out through this same polymer layer.                      The ractions are thus temperature related and transport                         limited.  The properties of the product polymer are therefore                   controlled by the pore structure of the catalyst.  As the                       reaction proceeds, polymer created in the internal pores of                     the catalyst increasingly blocks transport paths generating                     gradients in monomer concentration and temperature.                             Polymerization rate decreases and the molecular weight of                       product polymers vary greatly.  The catalyst ultimately                         fragments, exposing more surface area as well as more accesss                   to previoulsy inaccessible pores.  New sites are exposed,                       transport path length is reduced, and polymerization is then                    accelerated.  The facture occurs due to confined growth and                     expansion of polymer chains in narrrow, friable channels of                     the catalysts and is an autocatalytic phenomena.  This                          fracture rate depends on the catalyst pore structure which is                   thus of significant importance in the molecular weight                          distribution and yield of polyolefins.                                                                                                                          Gas phase polymerization has the advantage that:  (1) low                       capital investment is required, (2) it is a solvent free                        process (i.e. distillation, drying and solvent rcovery are not                  necessary), and (3) therefore operating costs and energy                        consumption are low.  The PIs plan to continue to                               experimentally study the effects of thethree-dimensional pore                   structure on the gas-phase polymerization of olefins.  Pore                     structure will be characterized by physical adsorption, X-ray                   tomography and porosimetry.  Extended N2 adsorption and 129                     XeNMR will be employed to charactized the microporosity of the                  catalyst/polymer system and the rate by which the monomer                       diffuses to the active surface.   X-ray imaging in two and                      three demensions will be developed to determine the spatial                     distribution of the catalyst within the growing polymer.  The                   results should yield a better fundamental understanding of the                  interaction of kinetics and transport phenomena and the design                  of not only better catalysts, but whole reactors as well.",
