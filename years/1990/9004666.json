 "awd_abstract_narration": "The immune response pattern of tadpoles of the South African                    clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is distinct from that of the adult.                Metamorphosis is a transitional period that separates the two                   patterns.  The objectives of this research are to examine the                   hypothesis that development of the adult immune system requires                 metamorphosis and is characterized by the loss of a major                       population of larval lymphocytes and replacement with new, adult-               type lymphocytes.  To prove or disprove the hypothesis, larval                  thymus or spleen cell populations will be cytogenetically                       labelled, and their fate during and after metamorphosis will be                 followed.  By implanting triploid thymus or spleen into diploid                 hosts and blocking metamorphosis in some of them, it will be                    determined whether renewal of T and B cell populations at                       metamorphosis is dependent on thyroid hormones.  Because                        metamorphosis is regulated by thyroid hormones whose effects may                be modulated by corticosteroid hormones, the direct effects of                  thyroid hormones and corticosteroid hormones in promoting                       metamorphosis-dependent changes in the immune system will be                    analyzed.                                                                                                                                                       These studies will contribute to a better understanding of the                  ontogeny of the immune system of amphibians, the mechanisms that                regulate production of lymphocytes during ontogeny, the                         neuroendocrine regulation of development of the immune system,                  and how immunological tolerance to \"self\" develops.",
