 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higher device production rate while manufacturing the same                      high quality product, is a goal of the microelectronics                         industry.  The principal investigators have developed a novel                   concept of programmed rate chemical vapor deposition (PRCVD),                   as a method to enhance device throughput and film properties                    in low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on patterned                  semiconductor wafers.  In PRCVD, process conditions are varied                  with time to compensate for the increase in instantaneous                       feature aspect ratio as deposition proceeds.  This should                       result in a larger average deposition rate than for constant                    rate chemical vapor deposition (CRCVD).                                                                                                                         The objective of this research is to experimentally validate                    the  concept of PRCVD for four representative chemical vapor                    deposition chemistries of current industrial interest:  (1)                     silicon dioxide deposition from tetraethylorthosilicate                         (TEOS), (2) silicon dioxide deposition from silane/oxygen                       mixtures, (3) aluminum deposition from triisobutylaluminum                      (TIBA) and (4) tungsten silicide deposition from tungsten                       hexafluoride/ dichlororosilane mixtures.  These reaction                        systems exhibit markedly different deposition rate dependence                   on temperature and reactant partial pressures, and thus                         provide a comprehensive test of the PRCVD concept.  Films will                  be deposited in a cold wall, single wafer microreactor over                     silicon based patterned substrates.  Deposited films will be                    characterized to determine if PRVCD produces films which                        posses the same critical properties as CRCVD films.                             Successful completion of this research will provide a                           methodology for commercial implementation of PRCVD, which                       could increase device throughput and decrease production                        costs.",
