 "awd_abstract_narration": "For vertebrate animals living in as aqueous environment mucus plays         an important role in their survival.  Studies with the hagfish                  (eptatretus stoutii), a primitive vertebrate and a copious secretor of          mucus, suggest an intermingling of mucins synthesized by one cell-type          (mucous cells) with aggregates of unusual keratin-like intermediate             filaments (IFs) from another cell-type (thread cells).  Interaction of          these components results in a change in rheological properties and a            cohesiveness which we hypothesize serves to facilitate the multifaceted         functions of mucus, including its biological activity.  The overall aim         of the proposal is to expand these observations in selected teleost             species (e.g. intertidal fish, parrotfish) in which mucus exerts notable        protective roles.  Major objectives to be achieved by immunological and         biochemical procedures are (1) identify and characterize cytoskeletal           components, particularly IF aggregates,released from specific epidermal         cell types: (2) determine if these aggregates can modulate the                  rheological properties of mucus or provide binding sites for secretable         biologically active substances such as the hemagglutinins/lectins; (3)          determine the cellular origin of thel atter compounds and their                 specificity for some microorganisms; (4) determine the sequence (cDNA           methodology) of the a,B and y polypeptides from hagfish thread cells as         a means to understand thread assembly in which IFs attain parallel              alignment and a change in polypeptide composition occurs during                 differentiation and terminal maturation; (5) establish whether the              hagfish IFs possess unique keratin like sequences or if they represent a        prototype for filamentous aggregates synthesized and released by                specific epidermal cells of teleosts.                                               These studies have great significance with respect to the                   biochemistry and structural features of intermediate filaments, as well         as the biochemical evolution of intermediate filaments.  The studies            also have major significance with respect to material defense mechanisms        of teleost fish.  Finally, these studies may lead to practical                  applications, such as the development of novel biomaterials for                 lubrication or extiles.",
