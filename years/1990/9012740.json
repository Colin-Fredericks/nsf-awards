 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major question confronting management in U.S. industry is whether             the anticipated economic benefits of investments in information                 technologies are being realized.  the results from prior reported               empirical research on this question are at best mixed.  The                     researchers consider this problem to be a measurement related issue,            and they develop a theory and methodology for determining the                   economic impacts of \"business value\" of information technology.  The            focus of the research is on the firm and its profit centers as the              unit of analysis.  The research is planned in three phases.  The                first phase involves a statistical analysis of manufacturing                    industry data acquired by the investigators to test several                     conjectures on prior discrepancies and estimate a theoretical model.            Based on these results, the model is refined in phase two and                   further tested (validated) with two new data sets from banking and              insurance industry firms.  The third phase synthesizes management               implications of the research for information technology investment              decisions.",
