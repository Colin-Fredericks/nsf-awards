 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the second SuperQuest program at the Cornell                National Supercomputing Facility (CNSF).  The CNSF is an NSF                    supported facility providing access time, education, training and               user consulting services to scientific researchers.  The first                  SuperQuest program was held in 1989 and was co-funded by NSF and                IBM.  The SuperQuest program is intended to encourage computational             science and engineering at the high school level.  Teams of                     teachers and students from schools around the nation will compete               to participate in a comprehensive training/education program.  Four             schools will be chosen.                                                                                                                                         The centerpiece of the program is a three-week institute at                     Cornell.  The teachers and their teams of students will be                      introduced to the Cornell supercomputing environment, and receive               in-depth training in FORTRAN (the primary scientific computer                   language), optimization of scientific computer codes, the use of                parallel computing, and the use of computer graphics to visualize               results.                                                                                                                                                        In addition, well-known computational scientists and engineers will             lecture at the institute.  At the end of the institute, the schools             represented by the teams will each receive a configuration of IBM               workstations with communication links through NSFnet to the CNSF.               After the students and teachers have returned to their home                     schools, Cornell staff persons will visit each school at least                  twice over the next year to conduct follow-up training.  A Cornell              staff person will be assigned as a designated consultant for each               school, and each school will be given an allocation of                          supercomputing resources at Cornell for continued use over the                  coming year.                                                                                                                                                    The SuperQuest program is intended to stimulate the integration of              computational science and its tools into high school science and                in the long-run have far-reaching effects in enhancing and                      extending the educational goals of American students.",
