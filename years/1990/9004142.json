 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coast of South Carolina received a direct hit from                     hurricane Hugo in late September of 1989.  In addition to major                 economic loss, the native plants were severely  damaged from                    wind, salinity and flooding.  The next year or two represent a                  unique opportunity to examine the effects of a hurricane on                     coastal plants to determine if or how quickly they recover and to               asses their role in stabilizing the coast.  Dr. Young will                      investigate  changes in an ecologically important coastal shrub,                wax myrtle (Myrica  cerifera), based on photosynthetic responses                to the storm and the post-hurricane environment.  The research is               designed to take advantage of existing data and to support other                proposed studies of hurricane damage.                                                At two month intervals over the next year, photosynthesis of               wax myrtle leaves and bark will be measured at three sites                      differing in the extent of hurricane damage at north Inlet of                   South Carolina.  In addition, a greenhouse experiment with potted               plants will separate the effects of salt damage and water-logged                soils on wax myrtle photosynthesis using environmental conditions               measured after the storm.  These experiments will determine how                 quickly wax myrtle recovers after a hurricane and will provide                  insight into the value of wax myrtle for reducing coastal erosion               from storms.",
