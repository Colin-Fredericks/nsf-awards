 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Mark W. Meisel and others of the Microkelvin                Research Laboratory of the University of Florida for an international           research collaboration in physics and cryogenic engineering with                Giorgio Frossati, Director, and others, of the High Magnetic                    Field/Low Temperature Laboratory of the University of Leiden, The               Netherlands.  Their physics collaboration involves the study of                 highly polarized normal liquid and superfluid Helium-3 and the                  magnetic phase diagram of solid Helium-3.  Meisel offers substantial            ultrasonic expertise to the study of polarized liquid Helium at                 Leiden.  Both groups will benefit from an exchange of experience as             each team studies solid helium-3 under slightly different conditions.                                                                                           Their cooperative work in cryogenic engineering will benefit                    greatly from the pioneering work at Leiden.  They will work jointly             on the design and construction of a high cooling power dilution                 refrigerator (DR) that will encircle a nuclear demagnetization                  refrigerator (NDR.)  Nesting the DR/NDR system will shorten the                 length of the high magnetic field/low temperature cryostats.  This              will reduce the intrinsic vibration problems associated with five-              meter-long cryostats and it will eliminate the need for long, narrow            neck dewars that are difficult to fabricate.  The first prototype               will be built in Leiden and the second generation system will be                constructed for the University of Florida.  It will be ideally                  suited for a low temperature station at the new NSF High Magnetic               Field Facility presently being planned.",
