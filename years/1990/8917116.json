 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a geomorphic investigation of fluvial processes in an                   area in which tectonic activity varies between river basins, and                climate varies with time among the basins.  Tectonic controls                   will dominate terrace formation in high uplift rate regions, and                climatic controls will gain increasing importance as uplift rate                declines.  We propose to test this hypothesis on the basis of                   differences and similarities in the terrace sequences of three                  moderate size rivers developed in argillaceous sandstone in                     coastal northern California.  Present climatic controls on amount               and intensity of precipitation and temperature are very similar                 for each drainage basin, although these parameters have varied                  with late Cenozoic climatic perturbations that ultimately drove                 the rise and fall of eustatic sea level.  Base-level processes                  related to relative rise of the land mass vary by an order of                   magnitude from the southernmost to the northernmost rivers.                     Fieldwork in each watershed will consist of continuous surveying                and mapping of the longitudinal profiles of erosional terraces,                 depositional terraces, and the modern channel and floodplain.                   Seismic refraction studies will quantify depth of fill where not                observable.  The chronology of terrace formation will be                        constrained by radiometric dating of organic material from                      alluvial sediments either resting upon erosional terraces, or                   within deposits that comprise depositional terraces.  This work                 will allow quantification of the nature and rates of propagation                of channel incision and valley in-filling in response to changing               climate and long-term tectonism.  Comparison of the results for                 the three rivers, and thus separation of tectonic and climatic                  controls, should allow:  1) better understanding of the nature of               fluvial response to change, 2) interpreting the environmental                   significance of strath versus fill terraces, and of preserved                   flights of terraces in general, and 3) integrating an                           understanding of geomorphic processes with models of landscape                  evolution.",
