 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cell wall polysaccharides of red algae include the                         commercially important carrageenans and agarocolloids as well as                cellulose, xylans, mannans, and complex heteropolysaccharides.                  Due in part to the commercial significance of these compounds and               their derivatives as gelling, emulsifying, and sizing agents,                   much is known of the chemistry of these polymers from selected                  organisms.  Relatively little is known, however, about the                      taxonomic distribution of these and related natural products                    among major groups of the red algae (Rhodophyta).  Drs. Gretz and               Sommerfeld are undertaking an extensive chemical survey to                      address this problem.  Cell wall polysaccharides are also                       potentially useful biochemical markers that may be valuable in                  the assessment of natural evolutionary affinities between algal                 groups.  Efforts in this project will be directed toward                        biochemical analysis of cell walls of \"key\" groups in the                       Erythropeltidales, Compsopogonales, Rhodochaetales,                             Achrochaetiales, Nemaliales, Batrachospermales, and                             Bonnemaisonales using modern techniques such as methylation                     analysis (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry), nuclear magnetic               resonance and x-ray diffraction analysis.                                            In addition to the scientific information generated and the                potential for discovery of sources of novel natural products,                   this project is designed to encourage undergraduate students to                 participate in original research.  Students will be exposed                     directly to the application of the scientific method and to                     modern analytical techniques and apparatus, which will stimulate                their interest in careers in science.",
