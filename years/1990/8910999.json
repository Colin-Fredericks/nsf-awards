 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a case study of the Lake Michigan ecosystem.  The basic                 goal of the research program has been to improve understanding                  of food web relations, productivity and recruitment processes                   through the investigation of large-scale natural perturbations.                 Recent invasion of the laurentian Great Lakes by a predatory                    invertebrate never before present in the Nearctic has altered                   ecosystem food webs at a middle trophic level.                                  Changes have subsequently occurred in zooplankton species                       composition, and in recruitment success of some fish species.                   These changes may be linked.  The arrival of the invading                       predator in Lake Michigan has been documented, the first food                   web changes have been quantified, and the background, baseline                  conditions against which changes can be judged have been                        established.  The results from Lake Michigan prompted a new                     examination of historical data from Lake Washington, one of the                 most important analog studies, and yielded the discovery that                   nutrients produce distinctly different results at the ecosystem                 level than do food web changes.                                                 %%%                                                                             The structure of the food web of Lake Michigan has changed                      substantially since the introduction of the predators                           Bythotrephes and Leptodora.  The lake was under study before                    the predators arrived, and continued examination of its food                    chain dynamics and community structure will provide important                   insight on the adjustment of aquatic ecosystems to major                        perturbations in their food webs.  The contained nature of the                  Great Lake ecosystem makes it an ideal site for such an                         investigation.",
