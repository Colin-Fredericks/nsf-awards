 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental surface chemical interactions involved in the                   epitaxial growth of gallium arsenide from organometallic                        precursors are investigated using molecular-beam scattering                     techniques and surface-sensitive probes such as electron                        diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy.  Supersonic beam                    techniques are a powerful means to probe adsorption, the                        prerequisite to epitaxy.  Behavior of the adsorbed                              intermediates on the surface, including reaction, diffusion,                    and decomposition, are assessed by modulated beam techniques                    and by modulation of surface temperature.  Several                              crystallographic orientations are studied.  Attempts are made                   to synthesize adsorbed decomposition products such as hydrogen                  and carbonaceous species in order to assess their influence on                  the growth kinetics and the composition of the film.                                                                                                            This work provides the fundamental information needed to                        develop processes for more precise and uniform production of                    gallium arsenide crystals for microelectronic applications.                     The data produced will also find use in the simulation of                       existing processes employing epitaxial growth.",
