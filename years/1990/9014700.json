Grammatical relations (subject, object) are indicated as elements               of both word formation and sentence structure; their roles are                  dependent on factors of control and transitivity inherent in the                root, and transitivity and incorporation indicated in the word                  stem; and the relations are often interpretable only with an                    understanding of discourse structure.  This investigation will                  contribute to the completion of the student's University of Texas               doctoral dissertation in linguistics.  The study will add                       significantly to the limited body of descriptive information                    available on Coeur d'Alene and to the understanding of the                      morphology and syntax of Interior Salishan languages in general,                and will eventually serve as a basis for comparative Salish                     syntax studies.  Major topics will include the morphological and                syntactic structures used to indicate grammatical relations; the                function of (preposition)                                                       incorporation and lexical suffixation to alter or specify                       grammatical relations; the use of clitics and adjuncts to cross-                reference relations indicated by subject and object pronouns on                 the stem; and the roles of these relations in syntax and                        discourse.",
