 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern Mississippi Center for Marine                   Science (CMS) is a relatively young organization (less than four                years old); however, in its short existence, it has been very                   successful in establishing a quality research program focussed on               chemical and biological oceanography.  Of central importance in                 such work is the ability to follow trace elements in the                        environment.  Trace elements (such as the metals copper and zinc)               can be nutrients and/or toxins, but some of the previous work                   with such elements is now suspect because of the failure of                     previous workers to follow presently accepted clean laboratory                  protocols.  For example, many determinations of oceanic primary                 production may be unreliable due to trace-element contamination.                                                                                                     This project will provide funds to construct and equip a                   state-of-the-art trace-element facility at CMS.  It will                        encompass preparatory and culture laboratories as well as items                 of specialized analytical equipment, including a nutrient                       analyzer, a high-speed centrifuge, and a spectrophotometer.  The                laboratory will be maintained scrupulously clean, and the most                  stringent protocols will be followed in order to insure the                     integrity of trace-element research in it.  The facility will                   allow on-site and visiting researchers to continue and expand                   their involvement in such activities as NSF's Global Ocean Flux                 Study.  Equally important, the facility will be located close to                important coastal wetlands and will have direct access to the                   Gulf of Mexico.",
