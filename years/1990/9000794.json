One-on-one                faculty guidance will provide up to six different research project              opportunities in a 10-week summer program.  Projects primarily related          to engineering of biological systems include instrumentation for                estrus detection, anaerobic composting and digestion, mechanical                properties of frozen bio-materials, and water quality control for               aquaculture.  Agricultural engineering related projects include                 robotic machines in grape pruning, torsional analysis of rigid                  diaphragms, and greenhouse environmental control.                               One-half of the summer program students will be recruited from other            institutions and a concentrated effort will be made to recruit                  minorities from the 1890 Institutions.  Minority and women alumni of            the previous program will be encouraged to recommend fellow students            for this program.                                                               The program will provide students with guidance of independent sub-             project activity with increasing responsibility as the student gains            experience.  Written and oral reports of their research experience are          required.  A Presentations Day will be scheduled at the end of each             study period (summer, fall and spring) for all student participants.            The program is planned to generate additional student project                   proposals by the faculty and to provide a long-term model for a                 continuing program.",
