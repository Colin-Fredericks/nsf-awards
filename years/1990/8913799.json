 "awd_abstract_narration": "Virtually all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were                    synthesized in the interiors of stars, during supernova and nova                explosions, during mass accretion by compact stars (often                       accompanied by so-called X-ray bursts), and during stellar                      collisions.  The only exception are such elements as lithium,                   nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, and slightly heavier elements, which may              have been formed in trace amounts during the big bang.                                                                                                          The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to study nucleosynthetic               processes in the range of astrophysical environments listed above:              in supernovae, novae, X-ray bursts, stellar collisions, and the big             bang.  In addition, the work will focus on 3-dimensional (3-D)                  hydrodynamic modelling of stellar explosions and how the mixing and             clumping of matter during such explosions affects nuclear                       processes, and how the latter affects the former (e.g., by                      radioactive decay).   Particular attention will be paid to  neutron             capture cross sections for very neutron-rich light nuclei, electron             captures on nuclei beyond atomic mass 60, and inelastic neutrino                scattering.                                                                                                                                                     The topics to be covered are far-ranging.  The PI intends to                    collaborate with Ken Nomoto of Tokyo (supernovae), W. Benz of                   Harvard (3-D smooth particle code), J. Cowan of the U. of Oklahoma              and A.G.W. Cameron of Harvard (r-process scenarios), and J.                     Applegate of Columbia Univ. (big bang nucleosynthesis).  The work               is a continuation of research previously funded by NSF.",
