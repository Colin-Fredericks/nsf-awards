 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since the early 1970's there has been growing concern with the                  response of the criminal justice system to the crime of rape.  Many             people have questioned the special status of rape as an offense                 where the victim, as well as the defendant, is put on trial.  Some              have suggested that the laws and the rules of evidence relevant to              rape have resulted in pervasive skepticism among police,                        prosecutors, judges, and jurors about rape victims' claims.  In                 response to these concerns, most states have reformed their rape                laws but these statutes vary in range of reform and                             comprehensiveness.  Reformers expected that the new laws would                  reduce both the skepticism of criminal justice officials toward                 rape victims and their reliance on extralegal considerations in                 decisionmaking.  They anticipated that the reforms ultimately would             lead to an increase in the number of reports of rape, and would                 make arrest, prosecution, and conviction for rape more likely.                                                                                                  For the last few years, Drs. Spohn and Horney have been embarked                on a research program studying the impact of rape reform                        legislation.  In an earlier NSF-funded study, they collected data               on the outcomes of more than 24,000 sexual assault cases indicted               from 1970 to 1985 in six jurisdictions.  They found that the legal              changes produced significant effects only in the jurisdiction                   (Detroit) with the strongest and most comprehensive reforms.  The               present project builds on the earlier study by: (1) specifying more             precisely the nature of the impact in Detroit; (2) determining                  whether more subtle effects may have occurred in Detroit and in a               second jurisdiction (Chicago) where strong reforms did not affect               overall case outcomes; and (3) assessing the role of legal and                  extralegal variables in the processing of sexual assault cases.                 Detailed data will be collected on a sample of cases in Detroit and             Chicago and will be analyzed to determine the relative influence                of victim, defendant, and case characteristics on the disposition               of these cases in the pre-and post-reform periods.                                                                                                              The results of this research will advance understanding of the ways             in which rape reform legislation affects policy change and the                  subsequent processing of rape cases by the legal system.  It has                both theoretical and practical relevance in that it will contribute             to scientific knowledge more generally on the effects of                        legislative change on reform and to our ability to improve the                  manner in which the criminal justice system handles offenses.",
