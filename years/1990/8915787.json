 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many exothermic noncatalytic solid-solid or solid-gas                           reactions liberate enough heat so that they can, after being                    ignited, self-propagate.  These reactions, being ignited                        locally by an external energy source with short term service,                   may propagate throughout the sample at a certain rate and                       occur in a narrow zone which separates the fresh substances                     and reaction products.  This process has many names:  in the                    USSR it is referred to as self-propagating high temperature                     synthesis (SHS) and in the US as combustion synthesis of                        inorganic materials (CSIM).  The objective in development of                    this process is to learn how to effectively utilize the heat                    release from the reaction.  In ideal fulfillment of this                        objective, the synthesis reaction is thermally self-sustaining                  and the product is a very fine powder (which can be easily hot                  pressed or sintered) or a fully dense shape that does not need                  follow-on processing.                                                                                                                                           The purpose of the PI's research is to apply chemical reaction                  engineering  principles to the scale-up of reactors used for                    CSIM (the ultimate goal is the scale-up of CSIM technology to                   industrial scale).  He has been working in this area for eight                  years and has already obtained qualitative and quantitative                     information on the dynamics of CSIM.  In this project the plan                  is to follow the microscopic progress of CSIM reactions by                      observing them under a specially designed microscope.  He                       plans to use these results to estimate kinetics factors such                    as activation energy, frequency factors, etc.  Because heat                     transfer characteristics become more significant as the                         reactor size increases, he plans to measure heat transfer                       parameters, taking into account radiation also.  The                            parameters evaluated from experimental investigations of                        kinetics and transport mechanisms will be utilized in                           numerical modelling of CSIM systems.  New generation                            non-tradition models will be developed which will take into                     account the effects of film cracking, melting, evaporation and                  sintering.  In order to understand the mechanism for                            simultaneous synthesis and densification, a thermoplastic                       stress analysis in monolithic bodies will be performed.  The                    numerical simulation will help design an optimal experimental                   course by predicting the conditions under which the desired                     products can be synthesized.  They will also help in                            visualizing the conditions which lead to loss of stability and                  the associated non-linear phenomena occurring in the CSIM                       system.                                                                         The following systems will be investigated:                                                  1.  Synthesis of titanium carbide from titanium                                     and carbon (solid-solid reaction with                                           moderate expulsion absorbed gases).                                         2.  Magnesiothermic reduction of titanium and                                       boric oxides for synthesis of titanium                                          diboride (solid-solid with violet gas                                           expulsion).                                                                 3.  Aluminothermic preparation of niobium from                                      niobium oxide (solid-solid with melting).                                   4.  Synthesis of titanium nitride from titanium                                     and nitrogen (gas-solid at low pressures).                                  5.  Synthesis of silicon nitride from silicon and                                   nitrogen (gas-solid at high pressures).                                     6.  Manufacture of high density tiles of titanium                                   carbide (simultaneous synthesis and                                             densification).",
