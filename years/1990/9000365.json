 "awd_abstract_narration": "The geology of the southern Canadian Shield is remarkably                       similar to that of the eastern Baltic Shield in many aspects,                   including rock types, rock ages, and tectonic histories.  It                    is possible that the two shields were at one time in proximity                  to each other and may even have been located on the same                        supercontinent.  Whereas papers from Swedish and Finnish                        geologists on the western Baltic Shield have been available,                    until now the findings of Soviet geologists on the eastern                      Baltic Shield have not been accessible.  This workshop, co-                     organized by Dr. Richard Ojakangas of the University of                         Minnesota-Duluth and Dr. Sergey Rybakov of the Institute of                     Geology of the Karelian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of                    the U.S.S.R. in Petrozavodsk, will provide an opportunity for                   American and Soviet experts to exchange ideas and to evaluate                   and develop plans for long-term cooperation in this area.                       The workshop will also involve geological field trips in                        Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, and adjacent Canada.                                                                                                            This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in the                     United States and the U.S.S.R. to combine complementary                         efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                 competence in the field of basic scientific research on the                     basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
