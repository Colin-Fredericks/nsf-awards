 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews funding for Plasma Desorption Mass Spectrometry          (PDMS) activities at the Mid Atlantic Mass Spectrometry (MAMS)                  Laboratory at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.  PDMS,           one of several approaches to mass spectrometry, provides low resolution         measurements of compounds with high molecular weights (10,000 Daltons           or greater).  Analysis of ionized compounds in this size range is of            particular importance in the analysis of proteins and other                     biopolymers.  Efforts sponsored by this award will focus on improving           techniques for analysis of polyionic polymers such as oligonucleotides          and phosphorylated proteins.  Expected improvements should increase the         sensitivity and mass range of PDMS analyses.  A variety of                      collaborative research projects will be initiated or continued.                      Mass spectrometry plays an increasingly important role in the              structural analysis of biomolecules.  Information about naturally               occurring modifications of proteins, and about the structures of                polysaccharides and other branched chain polymers can only be obtained          with great difficulty by other techniques.  The MAMS facility was               established as a shared instrument resource for collaborative and               service projects.  The facility provides the research community at              Johns Hopkins and at numerous other institutions with access to the             kind of skilled mass spectrometry needed in many areas of modern                biological research.",
