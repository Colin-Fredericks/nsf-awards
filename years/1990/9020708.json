 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will evaluate the need for computational                          dictionaries, the value of large text databases in creating them,               and the role of cooperative efforts in this area.  Both                         commercial and scientific interests will be considered.  By                     \"computational dictionaries\" We encompass databases containing                  information about the form, pronunciation, meaning and usage of                 words and their collocations.  Such databases are not merely                    processed versions of conventional dictionaries.  Examples range                from a relation among company names, and product types; to a                    relation among verbs, derived nominals, and their co-occurence                  probabilities with various argument structures.  We believe that                the quality of computer programs for manipulating natural                       language depends crucially on the quality of such word-indexed                  databases, and that theories of the representation and                          manipulation of lexical information are central to scientific                   theories of language structure and language use.  We also believe               that some crucial kinds of lexical information can best be                      discovered by computer processing of very large bodies of text.                 Progress in research and in its commercial exploitation is now                  hindered by the unavailability of suitable computational                        dictionaries, and of generally-available text databases that are                large enough to help construct them.  This workshop will try to                 arrive at a consensus about what lexical and textual resources                  are most needed, what mix of co-operative and individual efforts                is appropriate to generate them, and what organizational                        structure is appropriate to coordinate efforts and distribute                   results.  It will produce a report reflecting the consensus of                  the participants.",
