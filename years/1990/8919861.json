 "awd_abstract_narration": "A perhaps over-simplified view of a \"scientific revolution\" would               have it that a great scientist develops a new theory to resolve a               perceived problem in science.  Once the theory is developed, it                 inexorably overcomes other, opposing theories to become the                     accepted \"paradigm\" of that scientific discipline.  This view has               typically been applied to the \"Newtonian\" revolution of the 17th                and 18th centuries.  In his Principia, Newton resolved the problem              of gravitation by unifying terrestrial gravity with the force                   controlling celestial motions of the planets.  18th century science             is then simply the history the advance of Newtonian science as it               rolled over the remains of the French Cartesian theory.                                                                                                         As simplistic as this theory might seem, stated in its baldest                  terms, it has been the accepted historiography of the rise of                   modern mathematical physics centering in France in the 18th                     century.  One should have been suspicious of this too pat a theory,             yet, until the work of John Greenberg, no one challenged it.  Under             an earlier NSF grant, Dr. Greenberg began the work of dismantling               this received view.  With this grant, he will complete that work                and replace it with a new, more sophisticated and realistic                     understanding of the rise of modern mathematical physics.  His                  study points up the critical function of international scientific               communication in advancing science, the influence of Leibniz,  the              contributions of mathematical-physical traditions (i.e. the work                of the Bernoulli's) dealing with the mechanics of rigid and elastic             bodies and fluids completely distinct from the Newtonian tradition,             and the strikingly mathematical achievements of forgotten French                mathematicians of the 1730's and 40's.  In other words, the                     completion of the \"Newtonian\" Revolution in 18th century                        mathematical physics was not so much the inexorable conquest of                 Newtonian physics as much as the synthesis of Newtonianism with                 continental physics and mathematics.  This synthesis calls into                 question the tradition of \"normal\" science following a revolution               and provides new grounds for work by historians, philosophers, and              social scientists into the processes of scientific development.",
