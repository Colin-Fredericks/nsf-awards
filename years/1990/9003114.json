 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is a renewal of a highly productive grant at                       Northwestern University (DMR-8701167).  During the three years of               support by the National Science Foundation two students were                    awarded the doctorate degree, one received the masters degree,                  and three students are in   various stages of the doctorate                     degree.  Seven papers were accepted for publication in refereed                 scientific journals, and seven more are in process.  The research               during that period emphasized the following:  (1) transition and                rare earth metals as electronically active defects in compound                  semiconductors,  (2) flow modulation epitaxy of indium phosphide                and its alloys,  (3) defects in indium phosphide based                          heterostructures.  The current research studies deep level                      defects in deliberately doped epitaxial indium phosphide and its                alloys prepared by atmospheric pressure organometallic vapor                    phase epitaxy.  A number of defect phenomena are being                          emphasized, for example, compensation mechanisms in heavily doped               material, deep donor levels associated with substitutional                      impurities, deep levels in quantum wells and superlattices, and                 rare earth related impurities.  The materials are being                         characterized using photoluminescence, photoconductivity, and                   deep level transient spectroscopy.",
