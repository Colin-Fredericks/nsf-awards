 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports theoretical research on the economic                      implications of Knightian decision theory, an alternative                       formulation of choice under uncertainty.  Knightian decision                    theory                                                                          explains, among other things, how different individuals with the                same objective information could attach different subjective                    probabilities to events of unknown probability.  Thus, the theory               creates a coherent framework in which individuals with the smae                 information could have different opinions about choices under                   uncertainty.  The differences of opinion create asymmetries of                  subjective information among individuals, for they do not know                  each                                                                            others' opinions.  The research elaborates the view that these                  asymmetries may help explain important economic phenomena, such                 as                                                                              price behavior, layoffs, and strikes.  The ultimate goal of the                 project is to deepen our understanding of general equilibrium and               the possible underemployment of resources in general equilibrium.                                                                                               It also provides a deeper theoretical anlysis of possible                       remedies                                                                        for the underemployment of resources.                                                                                                                           Knightian decision theory gives behavioral significance to Frank                Knight's distinction between risk and uncertainty.  According to                these definitions, a gamble is risky if the probabilities of its                outcomes are known and it is uncertain if they are not known.                   The                                                                             development of Knightian decision theory by this project is an                  important contribution because this new theory explains a number                of different types of decisions that appear irrational according                to standard Bayesian decision theory.  These include the failure                of certain markets to provide insurance, bargaining behavior of                 labor and management that produces strikes and layoffs and the                  insensitivity of personal saving to changes in interest rates.",
