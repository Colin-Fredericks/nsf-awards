 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to provide new information on the              cellar mechanisms that explain the ability of many 'cold blooded'               animals to tolerate conditions of low (or no) oxygen and low                    temperature.                                                                                                                                                    The ability of many vertebrate animals to withstand environmental               conditions that are completely incompatible with human life has                 intrigued scientist and laymen for centuries.  We now know that some            fish, amphibians (i.e., frog larvae) and reptiles (turtles, for                 example) are capable of surviving days, weeks, or even months buried in         the mud at the bottom of frozen ponds, even though there may be                 essentially no oxygen present at all.  While some species remain in a           state of hibernation, during which their metabolism virtually comes to          a halt, many other animals remain fully active at body temperatures             that would be quickly fatal to humans.  The mechanisms by which these           animals tolerate such extreme conditions are very poorly understood.                                                                                            The goal of this project, then, is to begin to understand the                   fundamental mechanisms by which animals that are in many ways similar           to humans are able to function under conditions so foreign to our               existence.  The key to this understanding may be differences in the way         that substances such as calcium and potassium are permitted to move             through the walls of cells in crucial organs, such as the brain and             heart.  If so, it may ultimately be possible to identify drugs that             would expand the resistance of humans to extreme environmental                  conditions.",
