 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed study of intra- and intermolecular interactions in                   more complicated structures -- DNA, polypetides and small                       proteins, complex natureal products, polymetallic species and                   enzyme mimics requires less routine 1D NMR experiments, pulse                   sequences for various 2D NMR experiemtns, solvent supression,                   and variable temperature experiments.  Multinuclear high field                  NMRs are ideally suited for use in these more complicated                       structures.  The results from these NMR studies are useful in                   areas, such as polymers, catalysis, and in biology.                                                                                                             This award from the Chemistry Shared Instrumentation Program                    will help the Department of Chemsitry at the University of                      Illinois acquire 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.  The 400 MHz NMR                     spectrometer will be used in research investigations in the                     following areas of chemistry:                                                                                                                                   1.
