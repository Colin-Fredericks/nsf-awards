 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a theoretical physics project to calculate some                    properties of matter at extremely high temperatures (1010 times                 room temperature) and high densities (1015 times normal).                       These conditions occurred in the early universe and are                         recreated in particle accelerators that collide very large                      nucleii.  One part of the investigation will attempt to                         calculate scattering probabilities directly from thermally-                     averaged correlation functions.  A second part will investigate                 the physical significance of the wave excitations known as                      quasiparticles that can propagate at ultra-high temperature.                    These calculations will help test how successful the so called,                 \"standard model\" of elementary particles is when applied to                     extreme conditions.  The standard model is a theory which has                   very successfully described the behavior of the elementary                      particle constituents of matter under non-extreme conditions.                   It will be very interesting if it also succeeds at extreme                      temperatures and densities.",
