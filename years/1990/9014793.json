 "awd_abstract_narration": "High performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) offers                        important advantages over conventional gel electrophoresis in the               characterization of proteins and nucleic acids.  It is much                     faster than the gels and can be fully automated and instrumented                with sample injection, detection and collection.  In addition,                  HPCE can separate solutes with a resolution which is one to two                 orders of magnitude greater than high performance liquid                        chromatography (HPLC) using sample sizes four orders of magnitude               smaller than HPLC.                                                                                                                                              However, single-capillary HPCE can only handle solutes loadings                 of less than 1 ug.  It cannot be used at preparatory scales to                  provide material for further analysis, clinical research or                     therapeutic application.  Most scientists familiar with this                    technology believe that, if HPCE could be scaled to preparative                 levels, it would become an indispensable laboratory tool.                       Unfortunately, scale-up to preparative HPCE is not simple:  a                   preparative HPCE column must dissipate Joule heat effectively                   while maintaining the extraordinarily high plate efficiency                     routinely observed in ug. HPCE.                                                                                                                                 To reach the goal of 1 mg HPCE, a study is proposed which                       combines both theoretical and experimental analyses of single and                                                                                               multiple capillary HPCE.  The objectives of this research are to                (1) elucidate the mechanisms of heat transfer, separation and                   dispersion in single capillaries and to apply this knowledge in                 the (2) design of a preparative-scale HPCE column.",
