 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, our purpose is to ascertain the                               determinants of job satisfaction and happiness with family                      life from among twenty-six variables that are believed to                       have an influence upon both.  In order to determine the                         relative importance of the variables in accounting for the                      variations in both job satisfaction and happiness in                            family life, a block-recursive model depicting the                              bariable relationships has been developed and is to be                          subjected to empirical testing on a sample of 13,926 black                      and white female respondents.  The theoretical model will                       allow us to determine which factors are the most                                important in determining job satisfaction and happiness                         with life.                                                                                                                                                      In addition, it is perceived that the use of a block-                           recursive model will clarify some of the confusion                              existing in the current body of literature regarding the                        determinants of job and family satisfaction, while, at the                      same time, enable us to suggest a more parsimonious theory                      regarding the interrelationship of the variables.                                                                                                               The assessment of the relationships of the variables will                       be simplified through the use of multiple regression                            techniques with a multiple-partial correlational                                analysis.  This technique provides useful statistical data                      and tests of statistical significance regarding the                             interpretation of the data, and generalization of the                           findings to the general population of English speaking,                         female residents of the United states who are 18, and who                       do not reside in an institutional environment.",
