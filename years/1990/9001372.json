 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in Diophantine                            approximations of Professor Paul Vojta of the University of                     California at Berkeley. Dr. Vojta's project is to extend his                    already-productive analogy between Nevanlinna Theory and                        Diophantine approximation theory, so as to get information on                   algebraic points of bounded degree on varieties. In addition, he                hopes to generalize to varieties of higher dimension his                        independent proof of the Mordell-Faltings Theorem that arose from               applying his viewpoint to Dyson's sharpening of the Thue-Siegel                 Theorem.                                                                             This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
