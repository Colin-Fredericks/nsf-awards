 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the learning of both science and mathematics          concepts by 9th and 10th grade students.  The investigators intend to           conduct a series of teaching experiments designed to study how measuring        and modeling activities with real science situations influence student          learning of basic notions of calculus (rates of change, level of                accumulation-formally called derivative and integral).                                                                                                          The students will conduct experiments with sample dynamic systems               involving the variation of physical variables over time (falling                objects, flowing water, heating substances, etc.); the experimental             apparatus will include Microcomputer-based Laboratory probes to measure         and represent the relevant physical quantities.  The symbol system will         be implemented using a computer program with the software environment           that will be provided, students will be able to construct models and            represent whatever is predicated by a particular model.                                                                                                         RESEARCH QUESTIONS                                                                                                                                              The central research question is, \"What is the effect of measuring and          modeling activities upon students' understanding of science experiments         and the underlying calculus concepts of rate of change and integration?\"        Two additional, related research questions are:                                                                                                                 (1)  How do students use different representations (graphs, numerical           data, iconic networks, etc.), as they work to understand an experiment          and a model?                                                                                                                                                    (2)  Which symbol systems are most effective for student learning, and          to what extent may the optimal symbol system vary with the domain?
