 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our understanding of continental shelf meiofaunal communities                   is rudimentary, but it seems likely that winter storms are a                    major organizing force.  In temperate and boreal waters, storms                 are frequent, large in spatial extent, and capable of eroding                   sediment.  Given the vertical distribution of meiofauna in the                  sediment, most could be eroded by winter storms.  If it can be                  shown that species are adapted either to avoid erosion or to                    benefit from it, then storms may be implicated in community                     organization.  Dr. Thistle proposes to determine whether                        species present at a shelf site during winter avoid erosion.                    For those that do, he will test whether the energetic cost of                   being in the water column underlies the adaptation.  For those                  that do not avoid erosion, he will test whether the water                       column is a place of opportunity, at least in terms of their                    ability to increase their energy reserves.  Although there are                  other possible consequences, these are likely impacts and                       provide a place to begin an inquiry into storm effects on the                   organization of shelf meiofaunal communities.",
