 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dramatic changes in the industrial structure of many regions have          taken place in recent decades.  Older industries have declined or               departed from many regions, while newer firms have taken their places.          Research on the dynamics of industrial decline and growth generally has         focused on these processes independently; few attempts have been made           to link these processes, thereby determining the degree to which                abandonment of regions by certain manufacturers relates to the                  development of new industrial activities.  The first phase of this              project will examine case studies already completed by the                      investigators and by other scholars to enhance the conceptual framework         for the analysis of changing local and regional economies.  This                synthetic examination will expand models of production life cycles, and         it will clarify potential relationships among firms in local and                regional settings.  The second part of the research project will                consist of a detailed comparison of two industrial regions, one in the          northeastern U.S. and one in another part of the country.  Data on              economic, demographic, political, and other relevant factors will be            gathered, and corporate executives, civic, financial, and labor                 leaders, and other knowledgeable individuals will be interviewed.               These case studies will permit validation of the general models of              industrial change and identification of the processes and factors that          link different firms moving in and out of industrial regions.                        This research will gather and integrate conclusions drawn in a             large number of case studies on this important topic.  It will provide          a systematic, detailed analysis of the processes and factors that               influence the decisions of firms to leave or enter two specific                 industrial areas, and it will offer a valuable assessment of more               general models of economic locational decision making.  This project            also will provide an excellent opportunity for an outstanding scholar           at a predominantly undergraduate institution to expand the level of her         research, thereby benefitting both the scholarly community at large and         the students who will work with her on this project.",
