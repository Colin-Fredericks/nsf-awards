 "awd_abstract_narration": "One need only recall the progression of caterpillar to butterfly                to understand why metamorphosis in insects has been likened to a                second stage of embryogenesis.  Morphological changes between                   larva and adult are extensive, and because larvae, pupae and                    adults are accessible and large (relative to fertilized eggs and                embryos), they are amenable to studies of the molecular events                  underlying important aspects of development.  The study of insect               physiology and development is significant for another, more                     specific reason.  Insects can be agricultural pests and disease-                carriers.  Recent attempts have been made to find environmentally               safe, non-toxic, biodegradable agents to control the more                       noxious insects.  Among such agents are the very hormones that                  insects use to control their own development.  The goal of this                 research is to understand how two hormones (20-hydroxyecdysone                  and juvenile hormone), with central roles in this process, act at               the molecular level.  Chironomids (including Chironomus thummi,                 the fly used in Dr. Bergtrom's research) contain high                           concentrations of the protein hemoglobin.  In fact, the                         hemoglobins represent a large family of related-but-different                   proteins whose syntheses are regulated differentially during                    development.  The regulation of specific hemoglobin synthesis is                under the control of both 20-hydroxyecdysone and juvenile                       hormone.  The molecular level at which each hormone either                      stimulates or represses specific globin production will be                      measured using cloned globin genes.  The effects of the hormones                will be analyzed both separately and together on levels and                     synthesis not only of the globin proteins themselves, but also                  the globin messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that are transcribed from                     globin genes and from which globin proteins are ultimately                      translated in the cell.  By focussing on the dual hormonal                      regulation of single family related proteins, greater insight may               be gained into how these hormones affect cellular processes in                  insects.  Such data can contribute greatly to the confidence with               which hormones (or their synthetic analogues) are used in insect                control protocols, as well as to a more general understanding of                molecular processes of animal development.",
