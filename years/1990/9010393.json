 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most engineering mathematics is appropriate for representing               a single object under a single operating condition.  Mechanical                 designers, however, must reason simultaneously about many design                possibilities; that is, sets of objects under sets of operating                 conditions.                                                                          Previous work has produced a formalism for performing such                 inferences, called the labeled interval calculus.  This formalism               has been empirically validated in a mechanical design compiler, a               program which for a wide range of design problems accepts                       mechanical schematics, specifications, and utility functions, and               returns catalog numbers for optimal implementations.  However, the              tested version of the calculus is relatively complex, and has been              only partially analyzed mathematically.                                              The researcher seeks to simplify the calculus, develop precise             definitions for all its terms and proofs for all its inferences,                and clarify a number of issues surrounding it.  This will enable                the development of more powerful and reliable compilers, as well                as furthering the basic understanding of design reasoning.",
