 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the Control Instrumentation, Control Systems and          Robotics laboratory which plays a fundamental role in the new                   engineering technology program.  New courses are impacted and novel             experiments are being developed, involving transducing techniques, data         acquisition, various controller structures and responses for processes          and systems, as well as robot arm programming and robot applications in         a simulated factory environment.  The experiments and software are              being produced in workbooks, reports and laboratory manuals.                                                                                                    An innovative new format is being given to the procedures for                   assigning experimental projects as the experiments are based on                 practical problems solicited from industry.  The problems are assigned          and progress monitored in such a way as to emulate the conditions               encountered by engineering technologists in the industrial workplace.                                                                                           The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
