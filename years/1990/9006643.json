 "awd_abstract_narration": "The black pineleaf scale insect (Nuculaspis californica                    Coleman) is a parasite of western yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa                  Lawson.  The insects are shortlived relative to their host and                  largely sedentary, and their populations are subdivided and                     genetically differentiated over extraordinarily short distances                 in association with both individual host trees, and different                   branches within a single pine (Alstad and Corbin, in press).                    Three different kinds of evidence resulting from recent research                (Alstad and Edmunds 1989, Alstad and Corbin in press, and Alstad                unpublished) compromise our earlier view (Edmunds and Alstad                    1978, 1981; Alstad and Edmunds 1983a, 1983b) that scale                         population structure reflects adaptation of the scale demes to                  intrinsic, genotypic characteristics of individual host trees.                  The proposed research will test a new hypothesis about the                      mechanistic causes of local differentiation in black pineleaf                   scale insects infesting ponderosa pine: that scale adaptation                   results from selection related to extrinsic phenotypic traits                   which (a) are the product of interactions between the pine                      genotype and its environment, and (b) vary both within and                      between trees.  These opposing hypotheses represent major themes                in the literature of plant/herbivore interactions; they are of                  basic interest to evolutionary ecologists and have clear and                    important implications for forest management.",
