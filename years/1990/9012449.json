 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to excavate the most productive hominoid-                  bearing locality in the Miocene Siwalik sequence of Pakistan.                   This locality, in the uppermost Nagri Formation (ca. 9 million                  years old), has produced almost half of all the postcranial                     remains of Sivapithecus recovered from the Siwaliks.  Unlike the                cranial remains, these show few if any of the derived features of               the extant orang-utan, Pongo.  The most recently recovered                      specimen, a humeral diaphysis, is most similar to what can be                   presumed to be the primitive condition for catarrhines.  It may                 well be that Sivapithecus lacked a feature that is universally                  considered to be a shared derived feature of the extant great                   apes and humans, a medially torsioned humeral head.  As                         Sivapithecus is the only fossil hominoid that can plausibly be                  placed on the lineage of one of the extant apes, knowledge of its               postcranial morphology is critical for testing assumptions about                the morphology and inferred positional behaviors of the last                    common ancestor of the hominoid clade.  Previous recoveries from                this locality indicate that the probability of excavating                       further, relatively complete postcranial elements of Sivapithecus               is good.",
