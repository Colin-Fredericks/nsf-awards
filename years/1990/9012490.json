On the other               hand, infants' abilities to discriminate speech sounds have been                found to be remarkably strong, and universally available,                       regardless of the language of the environment.  Recent findings,                however, suggest a loss of ability to discriminate non-native                   speech sounds between 10 and 12 months.  The issue of the                       relation between perception and production in development remains               unresolved, particularly the completeness and accuracy of                       children's perceptual storage of adult words at the onset of                    their production of words.                                                                                                                                           The goal of the present project is to test and refine a                    promising new methodology for experimental testing of the                       relationship between vocal production and perception in infants                 in the course of their transition into speech.  The technique                   being developed is an operant conditioning paradigm which rewards               children's presses of an illuminated panel under appropriate                    stimulus conditions.  If the technique proves reliable, it will                 be possible for the investigators and others to use it to examine               children's capacities for phonetic discrimination more thoroughly               and accurately than has been done before.",
