 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History is developing                  an innovative exhibit and teaching laboratory called                            INTERACTIONS.  The unique feature of INTERACTIONS is the                        combination of an exploratory, interactive natural science                      exhibit with an adjacent live-insect-rearing laboratory.  The                   exhibits will give the visitors some of the exploratory tools                   and experiences of the scientist and involve them in the                        process of scientific discovery.  The laboratory will provide                   visitors with direct experience with scientists and involve                     them in the scientific process.  Ecological in scope,                           INTERACTIONS will communicate environmental issues.                                                                                                                  The museum's plant and insect halls, designed over thirty                  years ago, will be renovated totally.  In their place, a                        single, large exhibit and teaching laboratory will be created                   focusing on the interactions of insects and plants.  The                        exhibits, videos, computer stations, and adjacent insect                        rearing laboratory will invite visitors to participate,                         question and examine.  This combination of exhibits, hands-on                   activities, video, and laboratory will increase the retention                   of information, stimulate interests in natural science, and                     give vitality to the museum experience.                                                                                                                              The total cost of renovation, modernizing, exhibit                         construction and installation is $1,340,000 with $1,000,000                     raised by a vigorous capital campaign.  This request is for the                 balance of $340,000 to complete the exhibit construction.",
