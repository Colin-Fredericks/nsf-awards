 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of project is to investigate the effect of                     corporate debt-related restructuring (that is, mergers,                         acquisitions, leverage buyouts) on research and development in                  the U.S. over the period 1977-86.  The extent of merger activity                in high- versus low-technology industries will be evaluated.                    Four large data bases will be integrated and refined as part of                 the research effort:  the Census Quarterly Financial Report, the                Census Longitudinal Research Data (Survey of Manufacturers), the                National Science Foundation/Census Research and Development data,               and a comprehensive list of LBOs and other restructurings                       (derived largely from Mergers & Acquisitions data).                                  The project will provide statistical data, definitional                    rigor, and the methodological approach for analyzing the                        relationship between R&D funding and other economic variables.                  The results should provide further understanding of the role of                 industrial R&D activity in promoting national economic growth and               competitiveness, and thereby contribute to the Foundation's                     responsibility to provide for the collection and interpretation                 of data for science and technology policy formulation.",
