 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to address issues associated                          with college student's perceptions of success and how                           these perceptions vary based on demographic factors such                        as age, gender, race, income status, philosophical                              orientation, geographical environment, and educational and                      employment levels.  The purpose is to fully understand how                      motivation for academic performance, and so academic                            performance varies among the previously stated strata of                        college students.  The planning phase of the research will                      substantiate variations in motivation, or the lack                              thereof, controlling for age and current level of                               education.  The results from this phase will be used to                         develop a proposal to create a survey instrument based on                       the instrument developed by the Higher Educational                              Research Institute.  This survey will be distributed to a                       sample of students representing a cross section of the                          population based on the demographics previously mentioned                       but with a wider range in categories including age,                             economic level, income level, etc.  The instrument will be                      distributed to participants in the eastern, central and                         western portions of the United States.  This approach                           provides a variety of people and native and transient                                                                                                           populations.",
