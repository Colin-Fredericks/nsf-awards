 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acid matrix proteins from CaCO3 biominerals paradoxically may               inhibit crystallization on one hand, but may promote it on the                  other.  Apparently the soluble matrix proteins in solution can                  bind to crystals or crystal nuclei to prevent their growth while                the same proteins, immobilized on a substrate, can induce                       nucleation or direct crystal growth.  The proposed studies are                  directed at evaluating several hypotheses for the purpose of                    calcifying some mechanisms of matrix/crystal interactions.  The                 hypotheses are: 1) the primary structures of matrix proteins play               a major role in determining their activity; 2) crystals have                    different classes of binding sites for matrix molecules and                     peptides, many corresponding to crystal growth sites, but others                not related to crystal growth at all; 3) the polyanionic regions                of matrix molecules and peptide analogs of matrix bind to and                   block development of crystal growth sites, and the hydrophobic                  regions extend from the crystal surface, disrupting movement of                 lattice ions there; 4) immobilized-matrix nucleators of                         crystallization function best at a particular molecular size and                composition of polyanionic region - the presence of a hydrophobic               domain may suppress nucleation activity; and 5) the functional                  property of matrix molecules as regulators of crystallization is                their binding to crystal surfaces: soluble calcium binding per se               by matrix is not necessarily relevant to mechanisms of matrix-                  crystal interaction.  These hypotheses will be evaluated via                    several approaches, including automated Edman degradations and                  fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry for sequence analysis,                  automated solid -phase peptide synthesis, atomic force microscopy               for imaging crystal surfaces, as well as a variety of                           crystallization assays.  Evaluation of the hypotheses is required               for clarification of the mechanisms of matrix/crystal                           interactions and will lead to a better understanding of                         biomineralization in general.",
