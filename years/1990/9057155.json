 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents work performed by a Presidential                   Young Investigator on mathematical problems arising in the                      theories of partial differential equations and several complex                  variables.  In the context of the research these are not separate               areas but are connected by fundamental questions relating to                    understanding when a differential equation, defined on the                      boundary of a domain in a space of several complex variables,                   admits a solution.  When this is the case, it follows that the                  boundary data extends to a neighborhood of the boundary as an                   holomorphic function.  Domains in the space of two complex                      variables for which the problem can be solved have been                         characterized.  The present work will look at the higher                        dimensional cases.  There is reason to believe that a direct                    generalization to higher dimensions may not be possible.                        Estimates needed in the proof of the two-dimensional result do                  not carry over directly.  New metrics recently introduced will                  provide good estimates of fundamental solutions of the                          differential equations, however the sharpness one needs cannot be               obtained.                                                                            In addition to attacking this most pressing problem of the                 day, work will also be done in using methods developed in                       analyzing the partial differential operator on manifolds which                  are not necessarily the boundary of a domain in several complex                 variables.",
