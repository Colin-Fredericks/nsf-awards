Dr. Katok's project consists of two                   main parts: first, she intends to study the cohomological                       equations associated with geodesic flows on compact negatively                  curved surfaces; and second, she will generalize spanning                       theorems that she has already proved for automorphic forms on                   Fuchsian groups to locally symmetric spaces of dimension greater                than two.                                                                            Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, as                      exemplified by the work of Professor Katok, it retains connection               to its historical roots.",
