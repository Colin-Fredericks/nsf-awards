 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves novel strategies to produce                              antibody polypeptides with optimal structures for                               immobilization to insoluble carriers.  Each approach is                         designed to result in immobilized, monovalent antibody                          fragments with their combining sites facing out from the                        carrier surface, and attachment to the carrier will be                          achieved in a highly specific manner through a site on                          the polypeptide far removed from the combining site                             itself.  Attachment in this fashion should allow complete                       retention of antibody binding activity and thus lead to                         improved techniques of affinity purification.  In                               addition, immobilizing antibody fragments rather than the                       much large whole antibody should increase the number of                         antibody combining sites that can be immobilized on the                         carrier surface.                                                                                                                                                In the case of Fv fragments, site-directed mutagenesis                          will be used to incorporate a single attachment site at a                       desired location on the polypeptide.  The modified                              polypeptide will then be expressed in E. coli.                                  Production of Fv fragments in E. coli may prove to be a                         superior alternative to present-day hybridoma technology,                       which is frequently the limiting factor in monoclonal                           antibody production and isolation.  Moreover, both site-                        directed mutagenesis and random mutagenesis can be used                         to rapidly obtain antibody polypeptides with variant                            binding activities.  Protein engineering may also be used                       to introduce pH or metal-regulated binding affinity into                        the combining site.",
