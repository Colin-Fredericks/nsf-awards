 "awd_abstract_narration": "The state of the art in parallel programming is characterized by a              wide variety of process models, communication mechanisms, and patterns          of sharing and protection.  Experience suggests that no single model            of parallelism will suffice in every case.  Unfortunately,                      traditional operating systems tend to enforce a single model by                 embedding it in the kernel.  Overcoming this limitation is the                  principal goal of the Psyche operating system.  It is expected that             Psyche will allow each programmer to use the most appropriate model             for the task at hand, and will open up previously unavailable                   opportunities to use multiple models within a single application.                                                                                               This research focuses on Psyche as a testbed for multi-model parallel           computing -- evaluating the extent to which the Psyche user interface           makes multi-model programming possible, and determining the sorts of            user-level tools, techniques, and conventions that are required to              make it practical.  Building on an existing multiprocessor                      implementation of Psyche, progressively more complicated user-level             programs, beginning with coexisting but independent models of                   parallelism and working up to system servers that can interact with             many kinds of clients, and applications that use more than one model            of parallelism internally will be used in experiments.  In the later            phases of this work, expertise in our department's computer vision,             robotics, and planning groups will be drawn on for the construction of          large, multi-model reactive applications.",
