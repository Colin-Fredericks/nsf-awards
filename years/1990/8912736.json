 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Mahrt will reexamine the development of shear-                   instability and generation of turbulence in stratified flow by                  employing nonlinear stability analysis techniques (energy-Casimir               approach).  Preliminary work indicates that the critical                        Richardson number is generally larger than 0.25 but depends on                  the curvature of mean flow profile.  While this stability                       analysis is more general than previous analyses, a number of                    technical points must be examined before results can be developed               with confidence.  Most interesting are differences predicted by                 this approach and those of Ekman instability.                                        These analytical results will be compared to an                            unprecedented large sample of high-quality tower data collected                 in stable conditions over flat terrain (Riso, Denmark) and will                 also be applied to fast response aircraft data collected above                  the boundary later in several meteorological field experiments.                 The objective is to assess the relationship between turbulence                  development and the mean profile of wind and potential                          temperature.//",
