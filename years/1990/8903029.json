 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with mechanical tolerancing in design.                  Tolerances play an important role in precision engineering.  The                quality, reliability and cost of products manufactured depend                   very much on the tolerances prescribed.  This project seeks                     fundamental understanding of the relation among process                         capability, nominal dimensions and tolerances in mechanical                     design.  Two problems are considered:  (1) Can tolerances be                    rationally assigned (synthesized) given nominal design                          dimensions, process capabilities, and cost structure?  (2) Can                  nominal dimensions be synthesized from process capabilities and                 constrains?  These two problems will be formulated conceptually                 as non-linear optimization problems by developing the explicit                  modeling, numerical approximation, and computation structure.                        The research thus addresses the crucial issue of quantifying               the quality of a design from the geometric and computational                    points of view by relating tolerances, nominal dimensions, costs,               and process capability.  The concurrent ability to rationally                   allocate (during the design stage) and trade off among tolerances               in manufacturing, assembly and operation promises both a drastic                shortening of the current design lead time, and a more efficient                manufacturing environment.",
