 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Larry Brown and others of Cornell                 University to collaborate in geophysics with Professor Jean-Jacques             Wagner of the Laboratory of Petrophysics, University of Geneva, and             Professor Raymond Oliver, Institute of Geophysics, University of                Lausanne.  The objective of their joint research is to develop new,             more detailed geologic models of orogenic structure by computer                 modeling of deep seismic data recently collected across the Alps by             the Swiss researchers, with support from the Swiss National Science             Foundation.  The combination of exposure, thorough mapping,                     availability of multiple seismic lines, and tectonic history make               the Alps perhaps the most promising starting point for more                     quantitative comparative studies of deep structure of orogens as                revealed from reflection profiling.  Later, the Swiss results will              be compared with similar deep structures in Paleozoic and                       Precambrian orogenic belts in the U.S., which were surveyed under a             multi-institutional deep seismic program operated by Cornell                    University on behalf of COCORP (the Consortium for Continental                  Reflection Profiling.)                                                                                                                                          Deep seismic reflection profiling has become a standard tool in the             investigation of crustal structure.  Yet debate persists concerning             the actual cause of deep reflectivity.  An important development in             this field is the relatively recent acquisition of seismic surveys              across young mountain belts where a) structures are particularly                well exposed and b) reflection patterns can be traced to                        considerable depth.  The Alpine system is perhaps the best example              of such a system.  Preliminary three dimensional seismic modeling               by the Swiss of known Alpine structures, and their extrapolations               to depth have proven to be an effective interpretational tool in                providing a quantitative test of hypothesized structure in this                 active region.  By analogy, considerable light may be shed upon the             crustal architecture of older mountain belts where deep structural              interpretations have been more cryptic.  Thus this work may make                the Alps a prototype for intercontinental collisions and a                      laboratory for calibration of deep seismic reflection data                      elsewhere.",
