 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Cheverud will measure patterns of heritable variation                  and covariation in the size and shape of the face in two tamarin                species, the saddle-back tamarin (Saguinus fuscicollis) and the                 endangered cotton-top tamarin (S.oedipus), to determine the                     relative stability of inheritance patterns across these closely                 related species and the extent to which interspecific differences               in facial size and shape are consistent with the inherited                      pattern.  These results will be important in evaluating the                     genetic basis for evolutionary change in tamarins generally, and                also specifically in the endangered cotton-top tamarin.  Dr.                    Cheverud will also examine the extent to which the pattern of                   facial character inheritance and co-inheritance is consistent                   with patterns of facial growth.  Do characters which are under                  the influence of the same growth factors tend to be inherited                   together?  In this study, concepts from quantitative genetics and               systematics are fused to form the groundwork for future studies                 in which it may be possible to reconstruct the selective forces                 responsible for facial size and shape evolution in tamarins.                         The study populations consist of skeletons obtained over the               past 15 years through normal attrition from the Oak Ridge                       Associated Universities\" (ORAU) Marmoset Research Center.                       Detailed demographic records, including age-at-death and                        genealogical relationship are available for these specimens                     providing a rare opportunity for genetic studies on primates.                   The three-dimensional coordinates of facial landmarks will be                   recorded and used in a finite-element scaling analysis of facial                size and shape.  The numerical results of this analysis will be                 used in a quantitative genetic study of inheritance and co-                     inheritance of facial features.  Patterns of heritable variation                will be compared between species and to growth relations using                  randomization statistical procedures.  This study will be unique                in bringing together new techniques and concepts in quantitative                genetics, morphometrics, and statistics for the study of                        evolutionary systematics.",
