 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an integrated set of               techniques to enhance software safety in process control systems.               Examples of relevant types of software include that which monitors and          controls aircraft and other means of transportation, nuclear power              plants, medical devices, manufacturing processes, and aerospace and             defense systems.  Although system-safety engineers have developed               procedures to deal with hazards in physical systems, the introduction           of computer control has created new and unsolved problems both for              system engineers and software engineers.  The basic approach in this            research involves applying software hazard analysis and hazard control          techniques throughout software development, linking them to the system          hazard analysis and control procedures that are being performed in              parallel by the system engineers at the system level.  Confidence is            achieved through the use of layers of protection:  The software safety          verification and analysis is backed up by using software safety design          procedures that protect against hazardous states resulting from                 undetected software faults, including flaws in the software                     requirements specification.  Both of these are backed up by external            hardware protection.",
