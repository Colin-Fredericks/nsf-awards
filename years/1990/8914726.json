The objective of              the project is to compare and contrast two different recombination              systems of yeast.                                                                                                                                               The role of double-strand breaks (DSB) in initiating recombination              has been well established in experiments ranging from X-ray                     induction of recombination to the \"targeted\" transformation of                  restriction endonuclease-cleaved DNA.  In this project, the                     researchers will compare and contrast HO- and w-endonuclease                    initiated DSB recombination in yeast, using genetic and physical                methods of analysis.  The work will be carried out using galactose-             or phosphate-regulated genes to control expression of the nuclease.             Recombination will be primarily assayed using a plasmid containing              transcribed and untranscribed copies of the E.coli LACZ gene,                   where the transcribed copy is disrupted by the endonuclease                     recognition sequence.  Both researchers have carried out significant            work on recombination systems, and the proposed project will                    benefit greatly from their combined expertise.  This collaboration              offers a unique approach to the study of recombination events that              occur in different organelles of the eukaryotic cell.",
