 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in aerodynamic, structural, electronic,                    and propulsive technologies make possible a new generation of                   low-cost unmanned aircraft for atmospheric science research.                    The first such platform, designated Perseus, is already under                   development as a joint effort between Aurora Flight Sciences                    and Harvard University.  Perseus' lithium battery propulsion                    system will enable it to carry a 50 kg chemical sampling                        payload to an altitude of 25km.  The purpose of this SBIR                       program is to initiate development of a larger, more versatile                  follow-on platform called Theseus.                                                   The heart of the proposed Theseus platform is a solid                      polymer electrolyte fuel cell powering an electrically driven                   propeller.  A unique oxidation scheme will allow Theseus to                     carry a 450 kg payload for thousands of kilometers at an                        altitude of 20-25 km, and to reach altitudes as high as 40 km                   for brief periods.  The aircraft is intended to be operable by                  a field team of three people and to be transported in a single                  C-130.                                                                               Due to the complete reusability of both the airframe and                   the payload/s, Theseus will be capable of performing almost all                 of the scientific missions currently flown on large balloons or                 the manned ER-2, at costs significantly lower than present.  In                 addition, it will make possible a number of new missions due to                 its increased performance, precise spatial and temporal                         controllability, and increased operational flexibility.",
