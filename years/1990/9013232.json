 "awd_abstract_narration": "The protists are a diverse group of eucaryotic organisms,                  including the algae, fungi, and protozoa, united by their                       intermediate level of organization between the procaryotes                      (bacteria and blue-green algae) and the more highly organized                   groups of plants and animals.  Protists are commonly used as                    experimental organisms in laboratory studies of cell biology.                   Understanding the evolutionary relationships among protists                     groups has been impeded by the fact that algae, fungi, and                      protozoans are studied by separate communities of investigators.                During the past few years, however, several Task Forces have been               organized to study the similarities and differences across the                  three groups, and to establish standard nomenclature for                        structures that are shared by them.  This careful study should                  allow investigators to separate similarities that are due to                    common ancestry (homologies) from similarities due to common                    function (analogies).  The first such effort to be completed is                 the Task Force on the Flagellar Apparatus and the Cytoskeleton.                 The results will be presented at the 8th meeting of the                         International Society of Evolutionary Protistology, in College                  Park, Maryland.                                                                      The proposed Task Force meeting and its associated                         proceedings volume will have wide impact.  This synthesis will                  open new discussions between cell biologists, evolutionary                      biologists, and systematists working of algae, fungi, and                       protozoans.  These findings will help to clear the path leading                 to a better understanding of the ancient diversification of                     higher organisms.",
