 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two week intensive training session at the                Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center (PSC) for twenty two students.  The             participants will be exposed to multi-processing, numerical                     methods, data communications, graphics as well as the standard                  elements of supercomputing.  Vectorization will be discussed and                students will be introduced to the FORGE Automatic Code                         vectorization package.  students will become familiar with                      performance monitoring techniques, visualization techniques and                 multi-tasking with an introduction to parallel theory.  The                     students will be divided into three groups with each group                      receiving a project assignment.  First hand experience with                     distributed-task programming will also be part of the training                  institute.  Each group will be given the opportunity to produce an              animation sequence on videotape of their project results.  Faculty              will come from PSC, Carnegie-Mellon University, University of                   Pittsburgh, Thinking Machines Corporation and Pacific Sierra                    Research.  the supercomputer in use is the CRAY Y-MP/832.",
