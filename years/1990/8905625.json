 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Stephen Kowalewski and Laura Finsten will conduct a regional               archaeological survey of approximately 1000 square kilometers of                mountainous land adjoining the Valleys of Oaxaca and Nochixtlan                 in southern Mexico.  They will attempt to locate and describe all               substantial archaeological sites, as well as the environmental                  contexts (topography, soils, water, vegetation, etc.) of them.                  These sites will then be dated using existing ceramic                           chronologies from adjacent valleys.  Pottery and stone artifacts                will be collected and analyzed to provide information on changing               lifestyles and political affiliation over time.                                                                                                                 While the archeology of this mountainous region is not well                     known, extensive work has been conducted over many years in the                 adjoining Oaxaca and Nochixtlan Valleys.  In both, large                        independent polities arose, and their influence expanded to                     encompass surrounding areas.  However, how the two interacted                   with each other is not well understood, and because the present                 project will focus on the intervening region, it should provide                 such information.  It will permit a broader level of                            macroregional analysis and fill an important gap in a survey                    project which, with great success, has continued for many years.                While of potential importance, mountainous regions have been                    slighted in past work not only in Mexico but in many regions of                 the world.  Such difficult terrain makes systematic survey                      difficult.  Sites also can be hard to find.  The methodology                    which Drs. Kowalewski and Finsten have developed may be                         applicable in many other regions.                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 fill a major blank in the archaeological map.  Secondly, it will                test a new survey technique of potential widespread utility.                    Finally, it will provide new insight into the rise and                          interactions among complex societies.  In the examination of such               states archaeologists have tended to focus attention on the                     \"heartlands.\"  By examining the \"edges\" this research provides a                needed corrective.",
