He will continue his study               of pseudodifferential operator calculi adapted to the study of                  degenerate operators similiar to the Bergman-Laplace operator.  A               goal will be to obtain index formulae relating the renormalized                 Chern numbers to \"analytic\" indices for degenerate elliptic                     complexes.  And he will continue an investigation of the problem                of embedding three dimensional CR-manifolds.                                        For many years mathematicians have studied the behavior of                  certain differential operators on hypersurfaces which extend off                to infinity.  This study has its origins in the calculus of                     Newton.  In this project the principal investigator will analyze                operators which have large variations over very large domains                   \"near\" infinity.  In the past, only progress on operators which                 have small local variations was made.",
