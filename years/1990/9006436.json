 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cell activity depends on various ions crossing the cell                   membrane through channels that are sometimes very specific.                     These channels are formed by protein molecules in the membrane.                 Nerve cells often have a long process, the axon which extends                   from the cell body known as the soma.  Often channels in the axon               are distributed differently from those in the soma.  This                       research addresses the question of how different proteins, which                are continuously synthesized in the soma of nerve cells, are                    spatially distributed.  This project will examine the molecular                 mechanisms of sorting sodium channel proteins in nerve cells.                   Sodium channel proteins are synthesized in the soma, but are                    found in the membrane of the axon and are absent in the soma. In                the squid, an invertebrate, mRNA coding from rat sodium channels                will be injected into the soma.  As a result the cells will                     synthesize two different types of sodium channels making it                     possible to compare the spatial distribution of the two protein                 molecules.  The part of the molecule responsible for its peculiar               spatial distribution can be changed by changing the coding and                  thus is able to be identified.  This study will advance our                     understanding of long-term regulation of how nerve cells                        function.",
