 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. William Longacre, Mr. James Skibo will               conduct a series of analyses on traditional Kalinga ceramics.                   The results will provide the basis for his doctoral dissertation                thesis.  The Kalinga, traditional Philippine agriculturalists,                  are one of an ever decreasing group of peoples in the world who                 still manufacture ceramics for their own use.  For many years,                  Dr. Longacre and his students have recorded this process and                    watched how the finished products are employed in everyday                      activities.  A large series of such vessels have been observed in               use, collected, and now reside at the University of Arizona.  Mr.               Skibo will carry out two kinds of analysis on a sample of them.                 First, he will conduct an SEM study to examine surface wear and                 abrasion.  Because detailed information on actual use is                        available, he should be able to match human induced cause with                  microscopic effect.  Secondly, he will attempt to extract fatty                 acids, which are absorbed into the ceramic fabric during cooking,               to test the feasibility of determining food contents.  These                    acids are not heat destroyed during the cooking process.                                                                                                        Because pottery resists degradation and has been widely used for                over 10,000 years, it constitutes a major class of archaeological               remains.  While prehistorians have devoted great deal of                        attention to the stylistic analysis of ceramic materials,                       satisfactory techniques do not exist to determine actual uses.                  Mr. Skibo's research will, hopefully, serve to develop several                  which will be general enough to allow application in a wide                     variety of circumstances.  Because so much information is                       available for the Kalinga materials, they provide an excellent                  controlled situation for such a technique development project.",
