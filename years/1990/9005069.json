 "awd_abstract_narration": "Considerable motivation exists to study processes that govern              the abundance and distribution of rock debris at the base of ice                masses because they figure importantly in the dynamics and                      geomorphic manifestations of glaciers and ice sheets.  The proposed             work is aimed at better understanding how erosional processes                   operate to generate and modify debris at the glacier bed, and how               transport processes mix, disperse and eventually eliminate this                 debris.  Researchers will complete a theoretical model of glacial               quarrying and refine a new model of abrasion, which provides for                the first time a quantitative link between all major processes                  governing both the erosion of bedrock and the abundance of basal                debris.  Then, armed with new model results about quarrying of                  debris from the bed and particle/bed interactions, it is possible               to re-analyse considerable published data on glacial drift,                     including dispersal patterns, spatial variations in grain size, and             particle textures reflecting wear and fracture.  The physical                   insight and quantification gained from the models will shed                     significant new light on the genesis of glacial debris, and lead                to more precise inferences about the behavior of unlithified                    material at the base of ice sheets and glaciers than has been                   previously possible.                                                                 The proposed research is a natural extension of the work                   nearly completed on large-scale glacial erosion, with funds from                ERA87-08400.  This study provides a firm foundation for the                     proposed refinement of our erosion analysis, and its application                to the glaciological interpretation of key characteristics of                   glacial sediments.",
