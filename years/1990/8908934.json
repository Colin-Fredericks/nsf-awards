 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. De Groat uses a multidisciplinary approach to examine the                   pathways that are involved in the reflex control of the urinary                 tract and large intestine.  His studies are grouped into three                  major categories:  (1) the plasticity of synapses following                     neural injury, (2) characterization of the neurotransmitters, and               (3) the role of neuropeptides in the regulation of urinary                      bladder activity.   Past research supported by the National                     Science Foundation has expanded our knowledge of the neural                     control of excretory function and at the same time provided                     information which has had and will continue to have a broad                     impact on several areas of neuroscience.  With funds provided by                the Accomplishment-Based Renewal, Dr. De Groat will continue to                 explore the mechanisms underlying the recovery of bladder                       function following spinal and peripheral nerve root injury.  One                goal of these studies is to find new pharmacological approaches                 particularly in regard to peptidergic systems for the treatment                 of autonomic disorders related to traumatic injury or disease.                  The work of Dr. De Groat is an excellent example of where basic                 research to understand the central and peripheral mechanisms                    which coordinate sympathetic, parasympathetic and somatic inputs                to the excretory organs may lead to new therapeutic approaches                  for bladder dysfunction.",
