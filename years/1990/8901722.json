 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Nelson's research group is supported by the                           Experimental Physical Chemistry Program in various studies of                   elementary condensed phase photochemical processes                              time-resolved on a femtosecond time scale.  Phase-coherent                      molecular motion along reactive potential energy surfaces is                    being used to initiate, manipulate, and observe in real time                    the detailed evolution of photochemical processes occurring in                  condensed phases.  The goals are to elucidate the reactive                      potential energy surfaces along which photochemical change                      occurs and to characterize the effects of the condensed phase                   upon both the potential surfaces and the resulting dynamics.                                                                                                    Two classes of experiments are distinguished by the excitation                  mechanism.  In the first class, optical absorption of                           femtosecond pulses initiates phase-coherent molecular motion                    (coherent wavepacket propagation) on excited potential                          surfaces.  Time-resolved absorption of subsequent visible and                   infrared pulses and time-resolved fluorescence are used to                      monitor the subsequent dynamics and extract information about                   the excited-state surface.  The second class of experiments                     involves the use of impulsive stimulated Raman scattering                       (ISRS) to excite molecular vibrational motion on a ground                       electronic state surface.  Multi-pulsing techniques are being                   developed to increase significantly the amplitudes possible                     with the ISRS technique.  The coherent vibrational motion might                 then be used either to initiate a vibrationally-driven chemical                 reaction or to enhance or modify a subsequent photochemical                     process.",
