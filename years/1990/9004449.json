 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are two mouse dwarfing mutations that provide good models                 for studying the basis for induction of tissue specific                         transcription during embryogenesis. Both mutants lack the three                 pituitary cell types which produce prolactin, growth hormone, and               thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). The similarity of the mutant                 phenotypes suggests that the three missing cell types may derive                from a common precursor cell and that at least two genes are                    involved in this differentiation pathway. Classical genetic and                 molecular biology will clarify how the affected genes normally                  interact and whether they have overlapping functions.                           Specifically, double heterozygotes and double mutants will be                   produced and the phenotypes characterized in terms of                           neurological, development, immune dysfunction and ablation of                   additional pituitary cell types. An intersubspecific backcross                  will be used to screen candidate genes for linkage to the Ames                  dwarf mutation (df) on chromosome 11 and for fine mapping of the                df gene. Closely linked molecular probes will be used to generate               a long range map of the df region using pulsed field gel                        electrophoresis. The df mutant was generated by X-irradiation,                  therefore the long range map may reveal evidence for a deletion                 or rearrangement, which would facilitate locating and subsequent                cloning of the df gene. Linked molecular probes will be used to                 screen a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) library of the mouse.                Pituitary cDNA and cross species homology will be used to                       identify the df gene within the YACs. Identification of the                     mutant gene by reverse genetics will clarify the basis for the                  failure of progenitor cells to differentiate into hormone                       producing cells and expand our understanding of the basic                       cellular commitment process.                                                    %%%                                                                             The anterior pituitary is composed of a number of cell types,                   each specialized in the synthesis and secretion of different                    hormones. This study will determine if the products of genes                    essential for the development of the specific cell types act                    independently in each cell or whether their expression affects                  the development of neighbor cells.",
