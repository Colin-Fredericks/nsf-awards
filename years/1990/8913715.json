Clever                   will conduct theoretical research on nonlinear thermal convection               in flows heated from below.  The goal is to elucidate the basic                 mechanisms in turbulent convection and to interpret the                         convective features observed in the earth and planetary                         atmospheres.  The project contains four elements.                                                                                                               1. Three-dimensional time-dependent knot convection will be                     computed with emphasis on its relationship to the observed spoke                pattern convection.  Features such as mean flow associated, with                some kinds of time-dependent knot convection, will be studied.                                                                                                  2. Convection with asymmetric boundary conditions is typical in                 nature, but has received little theoretical attention.  Three-                  dimensional forms of convection such as those with an hexagonal                 or square lattice are expected to prevail.                                                                                                                      3. Computations of three-dimensional convection flows in the                    presence of a mean flow with symmetric shear such as plane                      Couette flow will be extended to the case of Poiseuille flow.                                                                                                    4. Convection in rapidly rotating spherical shells will be                     studied with high resolution numerical codes.  Results will be                  interpreted in terms of features of bifurcating solutions found                 in the cylindrical annulus model.//",
