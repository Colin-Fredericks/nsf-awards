 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in the analytic number                    theory of automorphic and modular forms of Professor Dorian                     Goldfeld of Columbia University. Dr. Goldfeld plans to                          investigate the growth of the coefficients of meromorphic modular               functions and hopes to derive asymptotic formulas for these in                  terms of Kloosterman sums. A related project of Professor                       Goldfeld is to relate the arithmetic of a modular elliptic curve                to the minimal hyperbolic distance between the zeros of the Hecke               cusp form of weight two associated to this curve.                                    Non-Euclidean plane geometry began in the early nineteenth                 century as a mathematical curiosity, but by the end of that                     century, mathematicians had realized that many objects of                       fundamental importance are non-Euclidean in their basic nature.                 The detailed study of non-Euclidean plane geometries has given                  rise to several branches of modern mathematics, of which the                    study of modular and automorphic forms is one of the most active.               This field is principally concerned with questions about the                    whole numbers, but in its use of geometry and analysis, it                      retains connection to its historical roots.",
