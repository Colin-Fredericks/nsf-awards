 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the interactions                        of chromium species in water solution with reducing                             substances.  Principal focus of this project is on                              reducing effects of naturally occurring, organic                                compounds.  The research will also consider effects of                          hydrogen-ion concentration, dissolved oxygen, iron,                             manganese and other naturally occurring reductive                               substances.  The goal of this project is to understand and                      predict changes in chromium speciation and mobility in                          aquatic environments.  Project objectives include                               determination of reaction rates and mechanisms for                              reduction of chromates by low-molecular weight reducing                         substances for guidance in subsequent work with natural                         organic compounds that may be found in soils and in                             surface water sediments that have been contaminated by                          chromium compounds.                                                                                                                                             Chromium compounds are used industrially, for the tanning                       of leather, metal finishing, pulp and wood processing. A                        better understanding than now exists for the processes                          that affect transformations of chromium in the environment                      and which affect its mobility in groundwater are likely to                      be applied in engineering design of systems for management                      of chromium-containing wastes and to deal with the                              contamination of groundwater from existing deposits of                          chromium wastes.",
