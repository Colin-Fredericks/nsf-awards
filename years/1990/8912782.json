 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. society has adopted and adapted scientific techniques for                  purposes of social control of risk.  These techniques incorporate               numerous, and potentially large, uncertainties.  They also serve                numerous, different social goals--scientific accuracy, social                   acceptability, the need for timely decisions, consistency over                  time, fairness to the parties concerned, protection of public                   health and environments, etc.--although most commentators have                  emphasized only the aim of scientific accuracy.  The law has                    developed a number of evidentiary procedures to guide decision                  making under uncertainty and to serve the many social goals a legal             system has.  Using aspects of the law as a model, this                          interdisciplinary team aims to design evidentiary rules for                     carcinogen risk assessment that can help to reduce some of the                  uncertainties and serve better some of the social goals of risk                 assessment.  The research involves determining which evidentiary                rules used in legal proceedings might be adapted for use in                     carcinogen risk assessments and examining the impact their adoption             might have on the social goals of these assessments.  During this               phase, research will focus on serving the goals of scientific                   accuracy and expeditiousness, which may conflict, and on developing             procedures that can serve other goals of risk assessment and                    adjudicate conflicting goals and evidentiary procedures.  Results               will be disseminated in presentations and via appropriate scholarly             and public policy journals.                                                                                                                                     This approach offers a broader perspective on risk assessment.  It              recognizes the substantial uncertainties inherent in it, provides               a comprehensive way of coping with them and offers some wider                   alternatives for thinking about the process.  This project involves             a collaboration between a biochemist/pharmacologist, statistician,              environmental engineer, resource economist and legal philosopher.               The topic is very important; the research team, well qualified;                 institutional support is good.  Results are likely to be of high                quality and broadly disseminated.  Support is therefore                         recommended.",
