The project                       will enhance leadership skills of teams for strengthening                       teaching practices; examine, document, and refine effective                     approaches and materials; enhance teacher knowledge of                          geometry; and develop sensitivity to equity issues.  The                        activities will include five regional one-week seminars,                        inservice work at local units, and presentations at                             professional meetings.  In all, 300 teachers of grades K- 12                    will participate, and over 4,000 teachers will benefit from                     the subsequent inservice efforts.  This project was                             initiated by the Board of Directors of NCTM and will benefit                    from its support of the activities.  Western Illinois                           University and the National Council of Teachers of                              Mathematics have contributed an amount equal to 24% of the                      National Science Foundation request. ***//",
