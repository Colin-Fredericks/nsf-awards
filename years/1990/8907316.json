 "awd_abstract_narration": "To remain competitive in a rapidly changing economic environment, more          efficient operation of production facilities in the United States via           on-line control and optimization is a key factor in improving                   profitability.  It is widely recognized that in many industrial plants          there are a number of critical control loops where conventional single          loop control is inadequate and there are significant economic                   incentives for advanced control.                                                                                                                                In the Phase I study, the feasibility of on-line multivariable system           identification of industrial processes using canonical variate                  analysis (CVA) was demonstrated on data from computer simulations and           experimental processes at the University of California, Santa Barbara           (UCSB).                                                                                                                                                         The Phase II, the integration of on-line identification and control             design will be a major focus.  The CVA method integrated with on-line           control design will be extensively demonstrated on several types of             processes, and compared with existing methods.  Furthermore, a                  detailed development of an extension of the approach to time varying            systems will be provided.  The performance of the system                        identification and control design methods will be experimentally                evaluated on a pilot- or full- scale industrial process.",
