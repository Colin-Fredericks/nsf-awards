 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Opportunity for Women Career Achievement Award will               support a cultural anthropologist who has had a productive                      research career in studying tropical indigenous hunters and                     gathers in the Bolivian Amazon.  This award will allow this                     scientist to develop her expertise by studying tropical ecology                 at the University of Florida, and by putting her knowledge of new               ecological techniques to immediate use by continuing her research               in lowland Bolivia on the foraging activities of two indigenous                 groups.                                                                                                                                                         This project is important because it will expand the scientific                 expertise of a female cultural anthropologist, allowing her to                  serve as a role model for women considering a career in science.                In addition the new knowledge she will gain on ecological methods               will allow her to collaborate more productively with biological                 ecologists.  Knowledge of the foraging activities of indigenous                 peoples is important because they may have adaptive procedures                  that will help us understand how to conserve to tropical forest.",
