 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the design and execution of laboratory                    experiments on cooperation in finitely repeated games.  Particular              conditions to be examined include nonbinding communication (\"cheap              talk\").  Other experiments are designed to investigate the                      relationship between cooperation levels and the payoff properties               of outcomes that serve as possible punishments or rewards.                                                                                                      Game theorists have devoted considerable attention to models of                 equilibrium cooperation in dynamic, multi-stage games.  The                     conditions thought to be necessary for such cooperation to occur                are affected by market and individual characteristics that alter                the structure of the game.  This project examines the behavioral                significance of these characteristics.  Such an assessment is                   important for future theoretical work.  In addition, insights                   gained from laboratory data may aid in predicting when cooperative              outcomes will arise in naturally occurring markets.  Many policy                debates turn on assumptions about the extent to which economic                  agents behave cooperatively.  The desirability of challenging a                 horizontal merger, for example, depends largely on the likelihood               of a post-merger conspiracy.  Similarly, when product quality is                unobserved prior to purchase, consumer-protection policies may be               unnecessary if consumers and producers cooperate.",
