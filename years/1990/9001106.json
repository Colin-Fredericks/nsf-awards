 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is to learn about the behavior of liquid                  mixtures near solid boundaries.  The work is primarily                          experimental.  The fundamental issues are the nature of the                     boundary states, including their microscopic structure; the role                and origins of short and long range substrate-liquid                            interactions; the importance of thermal fluctuations; and the                   response to thermodynamic forces both in and out of equilibrium.                There are three main projects:  First, a capillary rise                         exploration of the transitions between states of wetting at bulk                coexistence.  The variables here are temperature and the                        chemistry of the bulk liquids and the substrates.  Second,                      optical studies of the polarization and intensity of reflected                  light from liquid-solid interfaces as a means of uncovering                     microscopic features of equilibrium wetting layer structure.                    Third, the exploration of the nonequilibrium response of wetting                structures to temperature changes with time and fluid motion.                   The aim here is to learn about otherwise inaccessible regimes of                equilibrium response as well as time-dependent phenomena.  As a                 supplementary project, they will join with the research group of                Benjamin Widom to study the interfacial structure and energy of                 phase-separated polymer solutions through reflectivity and                      capillary rise experiments.",
