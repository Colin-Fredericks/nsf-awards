 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary research objective for this project is to obtain               new constraints on the profile of deep mantle electrical                        conductivity, plus the toroidal field and its vertical growth                   rate in both the lower mantle and the upper core.  Two different                geophysical data sets, the geomagnetic field and decade                         variations in the length-of-day, will be combined with several                  concepts from geodynamo theory, especially electromagnetic core-                mantle coupling, self-excitation, and the strong-field dynamo.  A               secondary objective is to implement a new theory of fluid motion                near the top of the core which relaxes the much used \"frozen-flux               assumption.\"  The new method has been developed in the preceding                NSF award, but has not yet been submitted for publication, nor                  has it been fully implemented.  Moreover, there is a remaining                  source of ambiguity in the model which requires new work to                     resolve.  Work on these two objectives are expected to contribute               importantly to the \"second generation\" of studies aimed a mapping               the fluid motion of the uppermost parts of the liquid outer core.",
