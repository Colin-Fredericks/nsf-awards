 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Thomas Croat of the Missouri Botanical Garden will                     undertake field collecting in South America followed by                         laboratory and herbarium study of the estimated 70 species of the               aroid genus Rhodospatha.  A relative of the philodendron, well                  known horticulturally, Rhodospatha along with many other aroid                  genera is poorly represented in herbaria collections and                        consequently is poorly known.  Members of the group are rather                  common in moist low-elevation forests of the New World tropics,                 where they contribute to the rich community of vines and                        epiphytes present in the rainforest.  Plants exhibit an                         interesting difference between juvenile leaf shape and adult leaf               form, partly related to the need to germinate on the ground                     followed by growth upward as a vine requiring neighboring plants                for support.                                                                         Dr. Croat will study morphological features of leaf, stem,                 flower, and fruit to discern reliable characters for                            distinguishing species.  An extensive survey of herbarium                       holdings of specimens of these species will enable detailed                     mapping of the geographic ranges and habitat preferences of the                 species.  Growth of selected taxa in the greenhouse will permit                 close observation of subtle morphological features as well as                   study of flowering and fruiting seasonality (if present at all).                A comprehensive taxonomic revision of the estimated 70 species,                 with analysis of generic relationships with other aroids, will be               completed at the end of the project.  The work will contribute to               our understanding of tropical plant diversity, and will make                    available materials and specimens for other researchers and                     students.",
