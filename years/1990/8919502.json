 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines an ambitious application of decision                     analysis to an important national problem.  The proposed research               has two distinct parts:  (1) to perform a decision analysis of                  the management of commercial nuclear waste, one alternative being               a repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada; and (2) to conduct                      research on methodological issues inherent in considering                       strategic governmental decisions, such as siting nuclear waste                  repositories.  The combination of these two tasks allows the                    former to be used as a case study for the latter.  In principle,                the application of decision analysis could make significant                     contributions to public decision making.  But in practice, this                 approach rarely is applied to significant problems.  Although the               obstacles to implementation are considerable, the past work of                  the principal investigators demonstrate that the task is not                    impossible.  Their prior work on the nuclear waste repository is                a classic example of good decision analysis.  Moreover, this                    earlier work has had an impact, not only in the science policy                  community, but also on some participants in the political                       process.  The investigators' record of accomplishments in                       previous NSF funded research is exceptional.  Not only have they                produced excellent academic research, they have demonstrated an                 ability to address important public policy issues in a way that                 enhances the level of public debate.  In all, the potential                     payoff from this project is very high.",
