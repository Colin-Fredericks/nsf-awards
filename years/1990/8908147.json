 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ornithology Collections of the University of Michigan                  contains approximately 200,000 specimens (including skins,                      skeletons, fluids, eggs, nests, and frozen tissues), making it                  one of the ten largest such collections in the country.  The                    collection's strengths are in the mid-west U.S., and recent                     research activities by the Museum's staff is adding to the fluid                and frozen tissue holdings.  The collection is used actively for                research, environmental impact studies, and education.  Curator                 Mary McKitrick proposes computerization of the handwritten                      accessions ledger, with subsequent addition of data and                         verification from the specimen labels.                                               The proposed computerization effort will increase greatly                  the research impact of the collection.  Data inquiries and loan                 requests will be managed in a fraction of the time now needed,                  and computerized queries will give researchers the first                        opportunity to study broader questions of diversity and                         geographic distribution.",
