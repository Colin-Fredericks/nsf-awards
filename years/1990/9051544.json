 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to increase the effectiveness of courses and                    undergraduate research in optical engineering.  Students study the              practical essentials of fiber optic design especially those aspects             that are verifiable in the laboratory.  Additionally there is                   opportunity for in-depth study and independent research.  Optical               systems are designed and tested under conditions similar to that of the         workplace.  Graduates are therefore better prepared for the kind of             practical work expected of them as optical engineers.  Students are             encouraged to engage in special topics in optical engineering under the         guidance of a mentor with the expectation that some will seek careers           in research who otherwise would go directly into industry.  In any case         the research experience widens students' horizons and allows then to            contribute to the knowledge base of this increasingly important area of         engineering.  The award is being matched by an equal amount from the            principal investigator's institution.",
