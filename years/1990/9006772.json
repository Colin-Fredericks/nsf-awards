 "awd_abstract_narration": "Population dynamics are determined by the demographic                      summation of individual reproductive success.  Reproductive                     success (that is, fitness) is measured by the representation of                 descendants in the next generation.  Many offspring disperse;                   therefore, the reproductive success of an individual cannot be                  known without determining the survivorship and reproductive                     output of their dispersing offspring.  The investigator will                    continue a 28-year study of age, sex, social behavior,                          reproductive output, pattern of space-use, social organization,                 and survivorship over the lifetime of males and females from                    four colonies of yellow bellied marmots.  In addition to                        collecting the basic demographic data necessary for continuity of               this longitudinal study, Dr. Armitage will be analyzing data                    collected over the lifetime of the research.                                          Many rodent populations require control.  Control measures                are ineffective if those animals that are killed or removed are                 quickly replaced by immigrants.  Because yellow-bellied marmots                 frequently are agricultural pests, knowledge of the fate of                     dispersers will contribute to the preparation of effective                      control measures.",
