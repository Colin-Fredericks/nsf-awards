The President will also direct the operations of the                  Commission's Secretariat, assuring that documentation is prepared               for meetings, that reports summarizing these meetings and other                 commission activities are prepared and distributed, and that the                Commission's work is coordinated with those of other related ICSU               commissions and unions.  The President will also represent the                  Commission in interactions with these other ICSU bodies.",
