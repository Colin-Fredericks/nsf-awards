 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research of Dr. John E. McMurry, Cornell University, will                   be supported by the Synthetic Organic Chemistry Program.   Dr.                  McMurry will continue his highly innovative studies of novel                    molecules with unusual bond types.  The studies of the                          chemistry of these atypical molecules will increase the                         chemist's ability to design materials with unique properties.                                                                                                   A detailed study has been completed of the in-bicyclo\u01314.4.4!-                   tetradecyl cation, the first stable organic substance with a                    three-center, two-electron (3c-2e) C-H-C bond. It is concluded                  that there is nothing inherently unfavorable about three-center                 C-H-C bonding in organic chemistry; the only requirement is for                 a rigid molecule that enforces the proper geometry and prevents                 rearrangements.                                                                                                                                                 The study will now be extended in several directions.  Several                  other rigid bicycloalkyl cations will be prepared to probe the                  effect of changing the C-H-C bond angle.  In principle, a bent                  3c-2e bond should be more highly favored than a linear bond                     owing to the enhanced orbital overlap that results from a                       decrease in C-C distance.  Never before, though, has it been                    possible to test this hypothesis directly.                                                                                                                      Second, work recently has begun on the study of three-center,                   three-electron C-H-C bonds.  Such bonding is presently unknown                  in organic chemistry.                                                                                                                                           Third, McMurry will prepare and study the first examples of                     organic substances with other kinds of unusual three-center                     bonds.  It is believed that the                                                 in-fluorobicyclo\u01315.5.5!heptadecyl cation should contain a                       three-center, two-electron C-F-C bond and that a new                            tetracyclic caged substance should contain an open                              three-center, two-electron C-C-C bond.  Substances with these                   unusual kinds of bonds are not known at present.",
