 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central focus of this work is to develop a                                  computational theory of numerical techniques for parallel                       processing and to apply state of the art computing                              machinery and methods to large systems problems.  More                          specific objectives are to develop and expand the theory                        of sparse vector methods and factorization paths to the                         design of parallel algorithms for matrix operations                             including applications to problems in large system                              analysis using supercomputer technology.  There are                             many instances where these algorithms might represent                           dramatic improvements over present techniques: three                            immediate appplications of the parallel sparse vector                           methods are parallel triangular factorization, inversion,                       and partition of matrices.  A graph-theoretic analysis of                       the factorization path graph has not yet been                                   accomplished and it is essential to the understanding of                        these methods.  It is also fundamental for efficient                            conventional and parallel sparse vector operations to                           have effective ordering procedures.  New methods are                            proposed in this research.  The methods proposed will be                        tested on the particular problem of power systems using                         supercomputers.  The essential problem that arises with                         vector computers is matching the corresponding matrix                           elements from source and target rows when performing                            operations using sparse vector techniques.  This work                           elaborates on the earlier proposed approaches Scatter-                          Gather and Explicit-Enumeration and brings out their                            relative advantages.  Arguments are given for the                               unification of both techniques in an efficient sparse solver                    and it is expected that an Overlap-Scatter sparse matrix                        representation will be used to achieve this goal.  This                         research relates to the statistical properties of parallel                      sparse vector methods in detail.  This includes the                             computational complexity of conventional and parallel                           sparse vector applications in matrix triangular                                 factorization, matrix inversion, refactorization, partition,                    network reduction, state estimation and Hessian                                 optimization algorithms, as well as the computational                           complexity of ordering schemes.  The techniques of                              parallel sparse vector methods algorithms are completely                        general and due to the significant savings in time and                          space the methods have many potential applications in                           other studies.  The expected result of this research is                         powerful new parallel methods for a variety of large                            matrix problems.",
