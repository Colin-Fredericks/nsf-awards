 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will preserve and make available a collection of                   living yeasts obtained through National Science Foundation funding              of microbial ecology in the Antarctic, southern Pacific and Indian              Oceans.  These studies were conducted during cruises of the R.V.                Anton Bruun, USNS Eltanin and the USCGC Icebreaker Eastwind during              the l960's.  As part of the research, more than 3000 strains of                 yeasts were isolated and studied in considerable detail.  The                   collection represents a unique genetic pool of organisms isolated               from an extreme and relatively inaccessible environment.  Some of               the strains from the collection, which were made available through              international collections, generated considerable research in the               areas of systematics, molecular biology, biochemistry, enzymology               and biotechnology.                                                                                                                                              At the completion of the research, the collection was freeze-                   dried to keep the strains alive with minimal maintenance.  During               storage, the seals of the lyophilization vials have deteriorated                and the viability of the collection is in jeopardy.  In addition,               it is difficult for interested investigators to use the collection              because the strain data is in the original field and laboratory                 data books.  This award will to make the entire collection and                  data readily available.  The collection will be relyophilized in                long term storage vials and the strain information placed in a                  computer data bank.  The collection and data will be included in                the Agricultural Research Service Culture Collection, U.S.                      Department of Agriculture, which maintains one of the world's                   largest microbial collections.  Strains to be made available for                agricultural, industrial and academic research, will be maintained              and dispensed.",
