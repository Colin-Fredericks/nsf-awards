 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SGER project to collect and to study the perishable                   earthquake and structural response/damage earthquake.                                                                                                           This project focuses on the unique opportunity provided to                      collect data of building damage and to calibrate and validate                   loss estimation models/buildings and a portfolio of buildings.                                                                                                  The study will use 400 Stanford University buildings as a                       portfolio which cover a broad spectrum of structural and                        material types.  This massive portfolio of old and modern                       buildings, which collectively suffered a total loss of $160                     million offers a superb data base to improve the damage/loss                    evaluation and estimation techniques.  The tasks entailed in                    this project are: (1) collection of factual damage data of                      structural and architectural mature,                                            (2) collection of soil dnad geological data of building sites,                                                                                                  (3) collection of strong-motion from campus sites, and                          (4) evaluation of damage and loss and calibration of models                     used.                                                                                                                                                           The results could be representative for many buildings in                       California and other states and the learning about existing                     models will be of significant value to many large                               institutions, corporations and communities.",
