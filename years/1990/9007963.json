The                   program seeks to enable US scientists and engineers to                          conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award is for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Malcolm H.                        Chisholm to support a 12 month post-doctoral visit by Dr.                       James D. Martin to France to work with Dr. Enric Canadell of                    the Universit de Paris-Sud on \"Electronic Band Structures                       and Chemical Bonding in Mixed Organic/Organometallic Charge                     Transfer Salts and Phosphate Tungsten Bronzes.\"  The synthesis                  of new solid state materials with predictable physical                          properties is presently a major challenge for chemists.                         Central to achieving this goal is an understanding of how                       electronic structures are related to specific crystal                                                                                                           structures of a material.  Dr. Martin proposes to examine the                                                                                                   electronic structures of organic/organometallic charge                                                                                                          transfer salts and phosphate tungsten bronzes.

Large and complex unit cells of solids make the                                                                                                    consideration of all orbital interactions quite difficult.
