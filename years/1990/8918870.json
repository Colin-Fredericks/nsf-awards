 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                    supports research of J. Baldeschwieler and W.Kaiser of                          California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion                       Laboratories respectively. The award funds research aimed                       toward the realization of examining the atomic motions inside                   individual molecules on surfaces.                                                                                                                                It is proposed to demonstrate the applicability of the                         scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to the detection of                         localized inelastic electron tunneling.  Simple systems which                   entail the essential physics for inelastic electron tunneling                   spectroscopy of adsorbates will be studied.  They are carefully                 chosen to be stable, easily prepared, and amenable to isotopic                  substitution to facilitate unambiguous assignment of spectral                   features to inelastic tunneling via excitation of adsorbate                     vibrational modes.  A liquid-helium immersed scanning tunneling                 microscope designed specifically for the proposed work will be                  constructed; it will be a modification of the STM design used                   at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of                 Technology for superconductor phonon spectroscopy, the most                     sensitive low-temperature spectroscopy measurement published to                 date.  Initial efforts will be directed toward detecting Si-H                   and Si-D vibrational stretching modes on hydrogenated and                       deuterated degenerate silicon surfaces.  Similar measurements                   are planned for hydrogen (or deuterium) rich small molecules                    chemisorbed to gold and silicon surfaces.  These simple systems                 can be used to optimize experimental and instrumental                           parameters for inelastic tunneling spectroscopy with the STM.                   The project will establish lower limits for the detectability                   of inelastic electron tunneling and may demonstrate the                         applicability of the STM to the detection of inelastic electron                 tunneling due to excitation of adsorbate vibrational modes.                     The proposed investigation constitutes a step toward the                        realization of spatially resolved vibrational spectroscopy of                   individual adsorbed molecules together with three dimensional                   imaging of their binding environments.  This is a potential                     application of the STM which would be of profound scientific                    and technological importance.",
