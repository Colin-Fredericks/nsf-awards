 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Biology Department at Wake Forest              University to purchase a Scanning Electron Microscope.  Two                     components of the Biology curriculum will be directly affected by               this award.  These include the laboratory components of several                 upper division courses, and Research in Biology, the mechanism by               which undergraduates do independent or directed study projects in               research laboratories.  The Biology Department has been very                    successful at encouraging students to undertake research projects               as part of their undergraduate experience, often leading to                     presentations at statewide or national meetings, and occasionally,              publications.  In addition, through the Department's outreach                   programs, secondary school biology teachers, high school students,              and students from other colleges and universities have the                      opportunity to participate in the research program.                                                                                                             Microscopy is one of the strengths of the Biology Department.  The              Department is well-equipped with sophisticated light microscopy and             video image analysis capability, which is available to                          undergraduates doing research projects or taking specific courses.              Over the years, a large number of students have used the                        transmission electron microscope as a tool to study cellular and                tissue organization in the electron microscope course and in                    independent research.  A scanning electron microscope will allow                correlative light, transmission and scanning microscopy, and will               extend the uses of electron microscopy to a number of laboratory                courses and research projects where it is not presently feasible.               The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal sources.",
