It also hopes that such will                      increase the interest of female and minority students in science                and mathematics. Two mathematics teachers from each high school                 will receive intensive training on both the \"content\" of the                    project as well as how to do peer coaching in its                               implementation. All high school mathematics teachers will                       receive training on the use of technology, mathematical                         connections, and problem solving applications.  The business                    sector will be involved directly in providing examples of each                  of these components through providing mentors for the teachers                  as well as summer internships for teachers from each high                       school.",
