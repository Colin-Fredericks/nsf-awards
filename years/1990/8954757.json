 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project, \"TERRACORPS,\" will develop an                        ecological science program for grades 6 to 8 through                            performance-based series of classroom activities, real life                     applications, and dissemination activity stages.  Thirty-six                    modules of instruction will represent life, physical, and                       earth science topics.  General activities in field studies,                     plus correlative units in social science, math, and language                    arts will be included in the project.  The units will be                        arranged into three levels of proficiency, each with                            increasing skills and higher levels of measurement, concepts,                   and knowledge.  A video-based teacher training component will                   be developed for instructional support.  \"TERRACORPS\" will be                   implemented with 600 students in twelve initial sites the                       first year followed by 1200 students and twenty sites the                       second year.                                                                                                                                                         This is a strong project involving cooperation among                       numbers of Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA, a school district                    and university faculty.  The proposal addresses a clear need                    for creating global awareness at this grade level and                           promises to have a substantial impact throughout the nation                     by providing a replicable model.",
