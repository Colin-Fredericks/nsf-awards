 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much of South America has been undergoing rapid habitat                    change due to the activities associated with habitat disruption,                increasing human population densities, and the conversion of                    habitats into agricultural and ranching areas.  The entire                      continent is moving from what was a pristine situation four                     hundred years ago to one where scientists are predicting waves of               extinction to occur some time in the next century.  This                        potentially critical loss in numbers of species of plants and                   animals is predicted to have global ramifications in its effect                 on weather patterns, the cohesiveness of ecosystems, and the                    storehouse of genetic information that is contained within the                  tremendous numbers of species that are found in tropical and                    extratropical habitats of South America.                                             This proposal is designed to assess the current status of                  mammal populations in Argentina.  Argentina includes a vast array               of the tropical and non-tropical habitats that are found in South               America.  Argentina contains almost 40 percent of all species                   found in South America, and by determining how these species are                being affected in their distribution and abundance throughout the               country, an understanding can be gained as to how the mammalian                 fauna might be changing throughout the continent.  The research                 is designed to examine patterns of species occurrence,                          reproductive status, relative population density, and general                   distribution of the mammals of Argentina.  In particular,                       possible trends in species or population loss will be compared                  with data that were gathered in the early 1900s or the late                     1800s.  Information will also be collected on the genetic                       composition of mammals and the ectoparasite community that is                   associated with the mammals.  This information will have direct                 bearing on studies of the genetic relatedness of the mammals of                 South America, on their rates of evolution, and on their                        possibilities as vector sources for diseases.  The collections of               mammals that will be made throughout Argentina will provide                     foundational data by which future trends in species abundance and               distribution can be determined.  These collections will be                      deposited in Argentine and U.S. museums and are expected to                     provide the necessary data to produce field guides and popular                  and technical literature on the mammals of Argentina as well as                 provide base-line information that will help develop a                          conservation ethic in Argentina.  It is hoped that these kinds of               materials will prove useful to other areas of South America as                  well.",
