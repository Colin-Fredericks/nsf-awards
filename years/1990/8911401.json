 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interrelationship between science and technology is one of                  great importance for the development of science and technology                  policy.  Historical studies of their interactions are among the                 best ways to determine the many fruitful kinds of interactions                  which may occur, both of science influencing the development of                 technology and of technology influencing the development of                     science.  Dr. Hunt is investigating an example of the latter                    interaction, indeed, an example of technology influencing one of                the most important developments in modern science--the                          development of Maxwell's theory of electricity.                                                                                                                 The formulation of Maxwell's theory of the electromagnetic filed                was one of the great intellectual achievements of the 19th                      century.  Why did it emerge in the 1850's and 1860's, and why in                Britain?  Dr. Hunt argues that the answer to these questions lies               in another great achievement of mid-Victorian Britain, the                      construction of a global network of submarine telegraph cables.                 The operation of these cables exposed British engineers and                     scientists to propagation phenomena and field effects that their                Continental counterparts rarely encountered.  Field theory, he                  argues, had important roots in these distinctively British                      technological concerns.                                                                                                                                         Dr. Hunt has previously studied the role telegraphy played in the               reformulation of Maxwellian theory in the 1880's.  He now is                    examining earlier developments, particularly the discovery of                   \"retardation\" on cables in the early 1850's and the subsequent                  revival of interest in Faraday's field ideas, and the work of the               British Association Committee on Electrical Standards in the                    1860's.  He has found rich archival sources in Britain which he                 will use in developing this argument.  Clearly, this research                   will add significantly to our understanding of the reciprocal                   relationship between technology and science.",
