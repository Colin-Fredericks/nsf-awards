 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular studies of phenotypic evolution within the                       Californian-endemic, annual genus Calycadenia are proposed.                     Unusual and well-resolved patterns of chromosomal, flavonoid, and               morphological evolution among these ca. 12 species and 30 races                 or forms make Calycadenia a model system for examining questions                of broad systematic significance.  Integrated chloropast DNA and                nuclear DNA restriction site polymorphism analyses are proposed                 to determine patterns and relative timing of evolutionary                       divergence of these taxa and accompanying phenotypic characters.                Issues addressed by this study would include (1) the role of                    selection in chromosome evolution, (2) the relationship between                 evolutionary divergence and chromosome pairing, (3) the extent of               evolutionary parallelism in complex anatomical features, (4) the                possible origin from within Calycadenia of two highly-distinctive               monotypic genera (Osmadenia and Blepharipappus) and their                       accompanying suites of unique phenotypic characters, and (5) the                taxinomic validity of a proposed-endangered species,                            C.fremontii.  This study would be among the first to integrate                  extensive phylogenetically-informative data from cytogenetics,                  phytochemistry, and morphology with evolutionary data from                      diverse nucleotide sequences in both chloroplast and nuclear DNA.               Preliminary chloroplast DNA restriction site data revealed an                   ideal level of interspecific variation for conducting molecular                 phylogenetic analysis in this group.     //",
