 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there has been considerable interest and activity in                   crystallizing high value (e.g., pharmaceutical) and/or                          difficult to crystallize compounds from supercritical fluids                    (SF).  Possible advantages might be extreme size reduction                      without thermal degradation or chemical contamination.  Rapid                   depressurization results in high supersaturation and causes                     high nucleation rates, making small crystals.  Such processes                   are termed SF nucleation as there usually is no attempt to                      grow the crystals.                                                                                                                                              The primary goal of this proposal, which is a continuation of                   earlier funded work, is to explore and exploit a novel                          isothermal isobaric method of supersaturation generation (and                   hence crystallization) in solute-laden SF, namely \"salting-                     out\" with high pressure N2 or other non-dissolving, non-                        interacting inert gases.  With CO2 as the main SF solvent, it                   has been shown that solute precipitation of 0 to ~ 100 percent                  (benzoic acid as a model system) can be obtained using                          different N2/CO2 ratios in the final SF mixture.  Actual                        crystallization occurs under isobaric isothermal conditions.                    Pressure would be reduced ultimately to remove product.  SF                     separation processes involving only CO2 and N2 gases might                      ultimately prove to be the most cost-effective way of                           separation and purification of a thermally labile solute                        mixture.",
