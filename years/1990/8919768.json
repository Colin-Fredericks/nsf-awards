 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                      Henry J. Shine will study \"Pericyclic Transition Structures\" in                 the Chemistry Department  at  Texas Tech University.  Professor                 Shine is collaborating with Professor  William H. Saunders in                   the Chemistry Department  at the University of Rochester.  In                   this study heavy atom kinetic isotope effects with specifically                 labelled substrates are being measured and bond order modeling                  calculations are being carried out in order to define the                       transition structures of reactions that are  known to be                        pericyclic.                                                                                                                                                     Heavy atom (carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen) kinetic isotope                      effects (KIE) and bond order modeling calculations are being                    made in order to define the transition structures of several                    pericyclic reactions.  Reactions being studied are  the                         aromatic Claisen rearrangement (allyl phenyl ether), the                        benzidine rearrangement (hydrazobenzene), and the aliphatic                     Claisen rearrangement (allyl vinyl ether and two of its                         derivatives).  The objective in the aromatic Claisen                            rearrangement and in the benzidine rearrangement is to use them                 to probe along the reaction coordinate for coupled motion of                    carbon atoms not directly involved in bond breaking and making.                 In the aliphatic Claisen rearrangements the objective is to                     define their transition structures and synchronicities, over                    which controversy has arisen from theoretical treatments.                       Modeling calculations will be made to fit KIE to bond orders                    and, hence, to optimized transition structures.",
