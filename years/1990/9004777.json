 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of the posotion of the supercontinent of Laurentia               with respect to Gondwana and peri-Gondwanide terranes, such as                  Armorica, Iberia and Avalonia, is of paramount importance for the               proper understanding and quantification of geodynamic events                    during the Paleozoic.  Unfortunately, the paleomagnetic database                for the Silurian-Devonian of continents once part of Gondwana is                incomplete and provides few constraints on paleogeographic                      models.  The result has been the appearance of several                          controversial paleogeographic models with very different                        interpretations for this period.  One means of constraining or                  testing such reconstructions is through comparison with well                    interpreted and robust biogeographic patterns.  One major group                 of marine invertebrates, the nautiloid cephalopods, is                          particularly well suited to this task.  A significant portion of                nautiloid evolution occurred during the Silurian-Devonian, the                  biogeographic database is large and can be made much better with                reasonable effort, analytical techniques are available to                       provide patterns of exceptional quality, and the spatial                        distributions of nautiloid cephalopods are now known to have been               particularly well controlled by barriers to dispersal of the                    magnitude easily recognized with proper methods.",
