 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year teacher enhancement project, starting in the                    summer of 1990 and sponsered by the University of Michigan-                     Dearborn, will provide a four week summer program and follow-                   up activities for 30 high school teachers each year from the                    Detroit Metropolitan area.  Preference for selection to the                     program will be given to teachers who apply as part of a team                   from the same school and represent the natural sciences and                     the social sciences.  The project will teach science through                    interdisciplinary problem solving by focussing on the Rouge                     River Watershed-the area which contains the school systems of                   Detroit, Wayne County, and Oakland County.  This program will                   interrelate the areas of biology, chemistry, environmental                      science, geography, geology and social science.   The Rouge                     River Watershed is the subject of intense scrutiny by the                       Michigan Department of Natural Resources and the media                          because of its extreme pollution problems and the mandated                      Remedial Action Plan.  Because the problems are more serious                    than most citizens recognize, a science education program                       which relates the scientific, technological, and social basis                   for the problems and the solutions will lead to improved                        understanding of science as well as create citizenry                            concerned and informed about its environment.",
