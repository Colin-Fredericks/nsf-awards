 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mating type control in the yeast S. cerevisiae provide a powerful               genetic model to understand both hormone/receptor/G protein                     signal transduction and the transcriptional regulation that                     underlies cell type specificity.  Our work has shown that yeast                 STE12 protein plays a central role in both of these processes by                binding to the DNA sequence that mediates pheromone (hormone)                   induction in yeast.  STE12 may thus be the ultimate effector at                 the DNA level of the signal transduction pathway triggered by the               binding of pheromone.                                                                                                                                           Our long term objective is to understand the role of STE12 in                   cell-type-specific transcription and its potential modification,                in response to pheromone, which allows it to increase the level                 of transcription.  We plan:  1) a mutational analysis of STE12 to               determine which amino acid residues are critical for binding to                 DNA, for activating transcription and for responding to                         pheromone; 2) purification of STE12 and characterization of its                 binding to DNA and its interactions with other transcription                    factors; 3) analysis of STE12 after activation by pheromone; and                4) genetic approaches to identify other proteins with which STE12               acts.  Given the striking conservation between yeast and                        mammalian transcription processes, and the central role of                      transcriptional activators in cellular differentiation,                         transformation, and viral specificity, our studies on this yeast                protein should have broad implications for understanding the                    control of gene expression in animal cells.                                                                                                                     The work in this proposal will increase our understanding of the                mechanisms by which cells turn on specific genes in response to                 signals from their external environment.",
