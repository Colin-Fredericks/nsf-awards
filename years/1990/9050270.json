The conference will                      bring together representatives of the school restructuring                      movement, a range of secondary school mathematics educators,                    and mathematicians.  The conference will address questions                      related to:  the defining characteristics of a new vision of                    secondary mathematics instruction as exemplified by the use                     of the Supposers:  the new roles and responsibilities required                  of teachers by these approaches: and the place of these                         experiences and approaches within the school restructuring                      movement.  Recommendations for continued activity by                            participants will be the major conference outcome, and will                     be disseminated through a variety of vehicles.
