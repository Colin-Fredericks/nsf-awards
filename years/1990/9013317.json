 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is directed at understanding how coordination problems             are solved.  It uses complementary game-theoretic, evolutionary,                and adaptive techniques to study historical models of coordination.             Most of the research is devoted to a detailed analysis of the                   dynamics of strategy choices in populations repeatedly playing                  coordination games and adjusting their strategies in response to                their experience in plausible, but not necessarily rational ways.               The project focuses on models with the structure of evolutionary                games, and on specific, simple coordination games, chosen both for              their economic interest and for the availability of experimental                evidence.  The evolutionary approach has important comparative                  advantages in studying coordination, and provides a good foundation             for adaptive models.  The ultimate goal of this research is to                  understand how group size, the sensitivity of players' payoffs to               each other's decisions, and player's opportunities to communicate               interact to determine how well they coordinate their decisions.                                                                                                 Coordination problems lie at the heart of many important questions              in economics.  These include the design of optimal incentive                    schemes; the characterization of which outcomes can be supported                by implicit contract in a long-term relationship; and the                       determination of whether, and how, bargainers share the surplus                 from making an agreement.  The analytic tools and insights into                 coordination problems from this project make a valuable                         contribution to this area of research.  The contribution consists               of new theories that provide more convincing characterizations of               behavior in coordination games than standard techniques.  For                   example, coordination experiments show that there are behavioral                regularities that can not be explained by orthodox game theory but              can be explained by the type of models developed in this project.",
