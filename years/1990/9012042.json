 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pennsylvania State University will establish a Center for                     Undergraduate Research Opportunities (CURO) to provide research                 experiences for minority engineering students during their                      undergraduate years.  The Center will be a component of the existing            Minority Engineering Program (MEP) in the College of Engineering.               CURO will begin operations with 20 minority engineering or science              students selected as research scholars.  These students will be                 appointed to work with faculty and staff in research units                      (laboratories or centers) within the College of Engineering, or                 participating interdisciplinary research units within the University.           The appointments will be for a period of two academic semesters, or             for the summer session.  Twenty-five research units with the                    University have agreed to participate in this project initially.  The           students will be required to take a course in \"Research Methodology\"            to get training in the conduct of research.  The research faculty and           staff will be provided with an orientation course on cultural                   diversity to improve their skills for interacting closely with                  students of diverse backgrounds.  At the end of the appointment period          each student will be required to make a \"Report of Research Activity.\"          Over a five year period the Center proposes to support a total of 120           minority engineering and science students as undergraduate research             scholars.  After this period, the Center for Undergraduate Research             Opportunities for Minority Engineering Students will become an                  integral part of the participating research units with the University           and the Minority Engineering Program.",
