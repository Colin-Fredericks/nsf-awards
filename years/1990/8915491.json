 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this research is to advance our                        understanding of the chemical processes controlling trace element               distribution and mobility in tropical surficial environments.                   Specifically, an integrated field and laboratory study is proposed              to examine the hypothesis that adsorption processes and vegetative              uptake are dominant chemical controls in humid, lateritic terrains.             This research will involve close cooperation between Brazilian and              American researchers.  The field site is in an undeveloped region               of Brazil containing Cu, Mo and Au mineralization.  The field                   sampling strategy is designed to determine the distribution and                 dispersion of these elements in the soils, waters and vegetation                of the area.  The mineralogy of lateritic terrains is dominated by              Fe and Al oxides, kaolinite and quartz which makes adsorption                   processes, in principle, less difficult to assess than in soils                 containing a more complex mineralogy.  To this end laboratory                   studies will determine parameters necessary to model adsorption                 processes including ambient pH, pHzpc, and surface area in addition             to conducting adsorption experiments, investigating trace element               phase associations using selective dissolution analyses and                     modeling these results with available adsorption models.  Lateritic             soils occupy large areas in tropical and sub-tropical regions and               our study will increase our understanding in several areas related              to the use of these terrains including soil fertility, pollution                episodes, weathering regimes and rates, and geochemical                         exploration.",
