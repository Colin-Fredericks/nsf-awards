 "awd_abstract_narration": "Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute will operate the Deep                        Submergence Vehicle (DSV) ALVIN during 1990 in support of                       NSF-funded research projects.  The DSV ALVIN is a 7.1 m National                Oceanographic Facility that is owned by the U.S. Navy and is                    jointly funded by NSF, NOAA and ONR for oceanographic research.                 Support for the DSV ALVIN is provided by each agency according                  tothe terms outlined in a joint Memorandum of Agreement.  The                   ALVIN Review Committee, which is composed of scientists and                     agency representatives, provides guidance for operations of the                 submersible.                                                                                                                                                    The submersible is carried by the R/V ATLANTIS II.  The support                 vessel and the submersible operate worldwide, and the submersible               is capable of diving to a depth of 4,000 m.  Operation of a                     submersible requires highly specialized equipment and extensive                 support from both the support ship's crew members and the                       submersible team.  Crew members for the DSV ALVIN are highly                    trained to ensure proper maintenance and saftey for operations.                 The support ship is outfitted with a special A frame on the stern               that allows the submersible to be safely deployed.",
