 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed work effort is to provide the unique                capabilities of Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) to assist the                 National Science Foundation in the implementation of a                          comprehensive  and well integrated program for reducing and                     managing wastes generated by U. S. Antarctic Program activities                 centered at McMurdo Station.                                                                                                                                    The project is to be structured into phases and conducted over a                period of five years.  The initial phase is designed to provide                 for data collection, experimental research, and assessment of                   pollution prevention and waste minimization opportunities and                   waste disposal requirement.  The results of the first phase of                  the project will provide for identification of waste minimization               opportunities and quantify and qualify the types of waste                       requiring retrograding back to the Continental U. S. or to be                   incinerated.  Emphasis will be placed on approaches for                         elimination and minimization of the quantity and toxicity of                    wastes.                                                                                                                                                         Based on the results of the initial phase, wastes that cannot be                eliminated will be identified for further handling and treatment,               probably via incineration.  As such, the likely second phase of                 the project entails design of the pollution prevention and                      incineration facilities for sitting in the Antarctic.  A                        significant portion of this effort is expected to be dedicated                  towards required research in materials and equipment designs                    capable of handling severe operational conditions and problems                  concerning various waste handling requirements, emissions                       control, and fuel conservation.  This portion of the program will               also include provisions to design a disposal system for ash                     residue generated by the incinerator, if deemed appropriate.                                                                                                    The third phase, procurement, entails selection of an engineering               and manufacturing firm to construct the pollution prevention,                   incineration and/or disposal systems that can be shipped as                     modules via containerized cargo to McMurdo.  The system must be                 designed to take full advantage of the capabilities of on-site                  personnel at McMurdo, thus minimizing the influx of personnel to                the station.                                                                                                                                                    The fourth phase concerns system start-up.  It includes shipment                of the systems to McMurdo, final assembly, start-up.  and testing               of the system.  The system is to be a \"turn-key\" operation and                  include any training required for operation of the system.",
