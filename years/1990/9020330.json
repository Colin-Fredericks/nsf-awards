 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER award is for the preparation of the molecular mechanics               program DUPLEX for release to the academic community of scientists.             The program computes energy minimized structures of DNA, and of DNA             covalently modified by foreign substances.  It has several unique               features that distinquish it from other state-of-the-art molecular              mechanics.  These features make it particularly valuable to                     scientists from various disciplines who wish to generate atomic                 resolution views of such DNAs.  Urgent requests for the code have had           to be deferred because the program is not ready for use by workers              who cannot code in FORTRAN for a Cray Supercomputer.  DUPLEX, fully             documented and automated to operate without requirement for any                 FORTRAN coding will distributed via a suitable mechanism such as the            Quantum Chemists' Program Exchange.//",
