 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the analysis of marine benthic samples                    collected in the vicinity of Arthur Harbor, Antarctica, following               an oil spill that resulted from the grounding of the Argentine                  supply ship Bahia Paraiso.  The vessel grounded on January 28,                  1989, and spilled an estimated 170,000 gallons of diesel and                    aviation fuel, which contaminated shorelines located up to 15                   miles from the site of the accident.  Although small in size, this              spill is of significance because the affected areas include sites               that are used extensively for fundamental scientific research and               are composed of highly rich and productive assemblages of marine                flora and fauna, which might include components that are very                   sensitive to unusual anthropogenic disturbances.                                                                                                                The experimental design includes tests for possible oil-spill                   effects on these various components of the intertidal and subtidal              communities.  In addition, a great deal of importance is placed on              basic research approaches to provide detailed descriptions of the               structure and composition of these communities and to determine                 the role of natural environmental factors (e.g., depth, sediment                type, organic input, environmental stability) in controlling                    patterns of spatial distribution and long-term variability (for                 those components having an historical data base).                                                                                                               These studies will provide an empirical assessment of possible                  effects of the Bahia Paraiso oil spill on benthic components of                 the Arthur Harbor region.  In addition, data from these studies                 will be extremely important in providing a basis for a more                     comprehensive understanding of the natural structure and dynamics               of the Arthur Harbor benthic ecosystem, as well as a basis for                  comparison of the benthos with other marine ecosystems of the                   world.  Finally, these analyses will provide baseline data to                   support continued studies of long-term, natural and                             man-induced variation in important living components of this                    diverse and productive region.",
