 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                    chemistry and in the subfield of reaction dynamics at gas metal                 interfaces.  Professor W. Henry Weinberg of the University of                   California at Santa Barbara will continue his studies of the                    reactions of gases at well defined metal surfaces.  The focus                   of the current work will be the understanding of the details of                 the promotion and poisoning of the dissociative adsorption                      reactions of nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide at ruthenium                   surfaces.  Further studies with more complex polyatomic                         molecules will also be done.  Simulations of the reaction                       dynamics will be accomplished to determine the effects of                       specific reaction channels in the adsorption process.  The                      results of this work will lead to an understanding of the                       factors governing catalytic reactions and the thermodynamics of                 reactions at the interface.                                                                                                                                     Several related issues in reaction dynamics will be explored.                   Molecular beam chemistry with the Ru(001) interface will be                     explored with vibrational spectroscopy of the adsorbates,                       following the products of complex surface reactions.  Local                     surface coverage effects will be explored by studying oxygen                    chemisorption on the Ru surface as a function of order in the                   monolayer.  Surface temperature modulation will be used to                      follow the reaction coordinates and quantify the reaction rate                  coefficients of a branching unimolecular dissociation reaction.                 Monte Carlo simulations of second order surface reactions will                  explore compensation effects in kinetic parameters.",
