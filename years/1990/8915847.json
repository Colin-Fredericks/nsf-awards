 "awd_abstract_narration": "The existing methods for handling natural-language texts for                    information retrieval are applicable only to relatively                         homogeneous texts of approximately equal length and style                       covering related subject matter. The available methodologies for                text analysis and indexing, text classification, text linking of                related text excerpts, and text retrieval need to be extended to                cover large heterogeneous texts, such as collections of messages                of the kind now being circulated on electronic networks, and                    collections of encyclopedia articles. In these cases, the                       articles differ in length and subject matter, and often also in                 style and structure. Such articles may also include extraneous                  materials, such as quotations from other texts, and                             bibliographic citations and cross-references.                                                                                                                   Two main tasks are undertaken, consisting of an automatic text                  analysis and text linking system capable of recognizing text                    excerpts covering related subject matter. When similar text                     portions are appropriately linked, a network structure is                       produced for each text collection which then guides the user                    during the text retrieval operations by producing reading                       prescriptions in response to particular user queries consisting                 of chains of related texts or messages. The results obtained in                 this research are expected to lead to the implementation of new                 text handling systems in practical environments that are of                     interest to a wide variety of users.",
