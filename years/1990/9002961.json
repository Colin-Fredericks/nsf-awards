 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two.year collaborative project between                                Declan F. Keane of Kent State University and Liu                                Yiming of the Harbin Institute of Technology.  The                              project is sponsored by NSF and the National                                    Natural Science Foundation of China.                                                                                                                            This is a project involving the resources of the                                newly.established heavy ion research group at the                               Harbin Institute of Technology to analyze existing                              data from experiments at Lawrence Berkeley                                      Laboratory's BEVALAC accelerator.  The goal of the                              project is to attain a better understanding of                                  nuclear matter that is far from its equilibrium                                 state, an objective that has been identified as top                             priority in the subfield of nuclear physics.  The                               proposed work will include interpretations of                                   results using collision simulation codes based on                               the most recent developments in nuclear transport                               theory.  Much of the work will be conducted using a                             dedicated computer facility at the Harbin institute.                            The Chinese researchers will re.analyze existing                                BEVALAC data containing multi.particle correlation                              information for both pions and nucleons.  Based on                              the Hanbury.Brown Twiss (HBT) effect, the correlation                           function or relative momentum distributions can be                              used to extract the spacial extent of the source of                             these particles.",
