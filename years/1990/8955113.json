 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microbiological Concepts will be a national project to                          improve the teaching and learning of basic microbiological                      concepts in the secondary schools.  In its first stage, this                    pilot project will test and refine the overall project                          concept prior to its extension to each of the states and                        U. S. possessions.  This first stage will train three-member                    replication teams geographically distributed in Southern                        New England, the Mid-Atlantic states, and the state of Texas.                   Eight teams (24 persons) each year will participate in an                       intensive activity-oriented four week workshop at the                           American Type Culture Collection facility in Rockville,                         Maryland.  Educational kits have been designed by the                           professional staff of this project.  The kits consist of a                      basic introduction to Microbiology plus the 12 basic                            microbiological concepts typically suggested for use in the                     secondary school biology courses.  The teams trained will                       receive assistance from the University of Rhode Island's                        science education staff in using these kits to plan and                         conduct a required minimum number of in-service workshops in                    their local areas.  These will train additional teams to                        replicate these workshops for delivery to Biology teachers in                   the local school districts.  A support system will be                           developed for the teams and teachers receving this training.                                                                                                    An amount equivalent to 66.4% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
