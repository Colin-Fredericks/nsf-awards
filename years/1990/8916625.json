 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is to examine the                        hypothesis that chemotactic factors are elaborated in the normal                peritoneal cavity and govern the migration of cells into and out                of the peritoneal cavity.  In preliminary studies this hypothesis               has been experimentally supported by the finding that peritoneal                fluid isolated from non-stimulated mice was effective in                        stimulating cell motility in vitro.  To further explore this                    hypothesis, approaches will be used that will facilitate the                    isolation, concentration, and purification of chemotactic factors               from the peritoneal fluid of non-stimulated animals so that                     specific components can be evaluated in one of several proven                   chemotaxis migration assay methods (blind-well assay method).  In               this study factor(s) that are chemotactic for cells of the normal               peritoneal cavity will be isolated, purified by gel filtration,                 and assayed.  Rabbit antisera against the chemotactic factor(s)                 from the normal peritoneal cavity will be prepared.                                                                                                             This project is directed toward understanding the biochemical                   factors regulating the behavior of migratory cells in the                       peritoneal cavities of normal animals.  Biochemical,                            immunological, in vitro migration assays, cell culture and                      electron microscope methods will be applied to this important                   fundamental problem.",
