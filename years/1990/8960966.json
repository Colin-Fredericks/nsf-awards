 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membrane diffusion is an inherently slow process.                               Consequently, membrane-based separation processes can only be                   economically viable if extremely thin, defect-free membranes                    are used.  Thin-film composite membranes with a permselective                   layer thickness down to about 0.5 um can be made by presently                   available techniques.  Membranes with permselective layers                      thinner than this would dramatically improve the economics of                   membrane separation.  The goal of this program is to develop                    the technology for making industrial-scale composite membranes                  with permselective layer thicknesses down to 0.1 um or below.                   The membranes will be made by modifying the solution coating                    process used to apply the thin permselective layer.  The                        coating solutions to be used will be characterized in having                    high viscosity at low polymer concentration.  Previous                          experimental data indicate that the use of such solutions                       enables a much thinner defect-free coating to be applied than                   is possible with conventional techniques.  If the technique                     can be applied to many different polymers, it will enable                       economically viable membrane-based separation systems to be                     made and applied to a broad range of gas separation problems.                                                                                                   Membranes made by the proposed process could have a                             significant impact on many industrial gas separations, for                      example, oxygen/nitrogen separation, removal of acid gases                      from effluent streams, or hydrogen recovery from many sources.                  The process economics could be sufficiently attractive to make                  membrane systems competitive with conventional separation                       methods in these and other applications.",
