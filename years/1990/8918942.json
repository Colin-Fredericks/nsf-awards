 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current interpretations of glacial history in the Transantarctic                Mountains permit two vastly opposing views of Pliocene Antarctic                climate and associated ice response.  One view, based on the                    semi-lithified Sirius Formation, calls for extensive ice-sheet                  collapse and warm (2-5 degrees C) marine flooding in East                       Antarctica, with Northfagus growing nearby.  A contrasting view,                based on isotopically dated unconsolidated Pliocene drifts,                     calls for mountain overriding by an expanded ice sheet under                    subantarctic climatic conditions.  This investigation is designed               to improve our understanding of Pliocene glacial history of the                 Transantarctic Mountains in order to reconcile these conflicting                hypotheses.  Field areas are in the Dry Valleys where all                       Pliocene glacial morphologic features and sedimentary units                     occur together with ashes from nearby volcanoes.  These ashes                   will produce a precise Pliocene chronology by the new technology                of laser fusion 40Ar/39Ar dating of single crystals.  The                       resulting glacial and tectonic history should clarify existing                  conflicts of Pliocene climate and ice-sheet response.  This                     will clarify the long-term mechanics of the global climate system               (particularly near 2.4 Ma), and its effect on eustatic sea level,               deep-sea oxygen isotope fluctuations, and the Antarctic response                to global Pliocene warmth.",
