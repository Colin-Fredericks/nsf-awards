 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic evolution and changing geographical ecology of                 land plants (phytogeography) has been important in the                          Phanerozoic history of the biogeochemical cycles in which plants                massively participate, especially the cycles of carbon, oxygen,                 nitrogen, phosphorus, and soluble bases.  The relationship is bi-               directional, with the atmosphere and substrate both shaping, and                being shaped by, the evolution and distribution of plants.                      Support is sought to:  (A)  Integrate information from numerous                 disciplines toward more complete and more quantitative                          descriptions of the mechanisms by which land plants have                        interacted with the physical and chemical Earth system over                     Phanerozoic time; (B)  Initiate work on a structure to track the                spatial distributions of the evolution of the land biota and to                 deduce the geochemical ramifications of phytogeographic                         distributions; and (C)  Undertake simple experiments on the                     effects of atmospheric composition, especially O2 level, on the                 combustion and decomposition of plant tissues.                                       The proposed research will elucidate Phanerozoic trends in                 the creation, decomposition, and burial of refractory Corg;                     improve specifications of the effect of atmospheric O2 level on                 fire, and thereby, on the organization of the land biota and on                 geochemical balances; improve the representation of the land                    biota in one dimensional geochemical models; and lay a foundation               for incorporation of vegetative cover into a three dimensional                  linked geochemical-climate model.",
