 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many species of animals, temporal relationships occur between                the female-attracting signals of adjacent males if population                   densities exceed critical levels.  When signaling involves the                  use of sound, these relationships appear as various formats of                  synchrony and alternation.  Dr. Greenfield's research will                      examine the adaptive functions of signal interactions in several                different singing insects that, among them, exhibit a range of                  synchronous and alternating formats.                                                                                                                            Observations and experiments will elucidate which of four                       hypotheses best accounts for the various formats of signal                      interactions.  The hypotheses are that (1) interactions enhance                 \"species recognition\"; i.e., neighboring males time their songs                 so as not to obscure species-specific sounds that females must                  hear before moving toward any one male; (2) interactions reduce                 attacks by natural enemies that find their prey by listening to                 the prey's female-attracting sounds; (3) interactions represent a               means by which groups of sexually advertising males compete with                one another to attract females to the group's vicinity; (4)                     interactions represent a by-product of sexual selection, wherein                individual males time their sound signals so that they can most                 strongly attract females and, at the same time, obfuscate the                   sounds of neighboring males.                                                                                                                                    The results of this research project may reveal subtle aspects of               sexual selection that would remain undetected in studies focusing               on how females choose among isolated males or in studies that do                not measure and control temporal signal interactions.  Because                  some acoustic insects are agricultural pests, information on the                roles of signal interactions in female attraction may be                        pertinent to effective control and monitoring strategies for                    certain pest species.",
