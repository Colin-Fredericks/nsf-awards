 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will document how regional shifts in                          paleoenvironmental conditions during the Proterozoic-Cambrian                   transition may have influenced the record of extinctions and                    radiations of early Metazoa.  Recent work in South Australia has                shown that the inferred gap between the last appearance of                      complex vendozoans or the Ediacaran fauna and the first                         appearance of Cambrian-aspect traces is, in part, artifactual.                  It is suggested that the two faunas are in close stratigraphic                  and, by influence, close temporal proximity.  In order to test                  this observation, detailed stratigraphic and paleontologic                      analyses will focus on the exceptional exposures of the                         Ediacaran-Cambrian transition in the Flinders Rangers, South                    Australia.  Two principal data sets will be developed: 1) genetic               stratigraphic sequence reconstructions of the intervl comprising                the Upper Rawnsley Quartzite/Ediacara Member of the Pound                       Subgroup (uppermost Proterozoic?), Uratanna Formation (uppermost                Proterozoic?-Lower Cambrian) and Parachilna Formation (Lower                    Cambrian); and 2) fossil/lithofacies associations of Ediacaran                  and earliest Cambrian trace and body fossils.  Integration of                   these two data sets will allow the reconstruction of time-                      environment histories of faunal occurrences and a test of the                   role that ancient environments have played in biasing this                      record.                                                                              By attempting to separate artifactual from factual                         signatures within the record, this research will have important                 implications for efforts to establish the causes and timing of                  the apparent demise of the Ediacara fauna and the dramatic                      subsequent radiation of the Cambrian fauna.  The results of this                work will contritube to on-going efforts to determine if there is               a link between latest Proterozoic/Early Cambrian faunal turnover                and a variety of geochemical and lithostratigraphic anomalies in                the rock record.  In addition, this research will improve our                   current understanding of the stratigraphy of a globally-                        significant Precambrian-Cambrian boundary section.",
