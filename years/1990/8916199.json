 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mullet's long range goal is to elucidate mechanisms which                   regulate higher plant chloroplast gene expression. He has three                 immediate goals; 1) to extend knowledge of environmental and                    developmental influences of plastid transcription activity, 2) to               elucidate the molecular basis of light-independent activation of                plastid transcription which occurs during early leaf cell                       development and the light-dependent activation which occurs in 8                day old dark grown barley and 3) to analyze the basis of psbA                   mRNA stability. The importance of this problem derives from the                 fact that the biochemical capacity of the plastid is defined by                 and requires coordinated expression of genes located within the                 plastid and genes located in the nucleus. In addition to the                    basic need to coordinate plastid and nuclear gene expression, the               plastid must also respond to a wide variety of environmental and                developmental signals. Information on chloroplast gene expression               and development will be extended to obtain a more detailed                      knowledge of the plastids RNA polymerase and its regulation. Dr.                Mullet has characterized stages of chloroplast development in                   barley primary leaves and identified light independent and light                dependent events in this process. In the present grant a detailed               study of the plastid RNA polymerase and factors which modulate                  its level and activity will be studied. In addition, analysis of                psbA mRNA stability and identification of the protein encoded by                ORF 1244 will be undertaken.                                                    %%%                                                                             This is a study of the molecules involved in regulating the                     turning on and off of genes in the chloroplast of developing                    plants. The chloroplast are the site of photosynthetic activity                 and contain a genome independent of that found in the nucleus.                  The coordination of the expression of the two genomes is clearly                important to the plant.",
