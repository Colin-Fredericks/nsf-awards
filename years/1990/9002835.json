 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solutions to the atmospheric (or oceanic) prediction                        equations require an understanding of the three dimensional                     spatial nature of the fluid, including dynamics and physics,                    conservation conditions, and forcing.  Since the equations are                  exceptionally complex and highly nonlinear, it is necessary to                  convert those equations to some numerical form which will provide               meaningful iterative solutions within the constraints of                        available computational capabilities.  The challenge is to do so                optimally.  While the problem has been investigated, because of                 the nature of the system, horizontal and vertical representations               have been considered independently in the past.  It is the                      contention of the principal investigator that systematic                        truncation of the atmosphere/ocean prediction equations in all                  three dimensions simultaneously could improve predictive skill.                      Thus, the purpose of this research is to study the                         correlation of truncation in all dimensions in a numerical model,               and to find a truncation which is systematic in all three                       dimensions.  The principal investigator will select a truncation                according to scaling arguments that are based on the results from               his previous studies and define appropriate functions.  To                      establish the optimal three dimensional truncation, the functions               will be tested in the operational numerical prediction model of                 NOAA's National Meteorological Center (NMC).                                        This project is part of the NSF-NMC Program Joint Program in                Numerical Weather Prediction.",
