 "awd_abstract_narration": "The underlying failure mechanism responsible for deep-focus                earthquakes has remained unknown since their discovery almost 70                years ago.  High pressure faulting was discovered in specimens of               Mg2GeO4 olivine deformed in the spinel stability field under                    conditions where the kinetics of the transformation become just                 possible on the time-scale of the experiment.  Very fine-grained                spinel is found in the fault zones.  The PIs pose four major                    questions: (i) Are microanticracks unstable? (ii) What is the                   process by which mode -I anticrack link-up leading to through-                  going faults? (iii) Which transformation mechanism operates at                  the tips of anticracks? (iv) Does the anticrack mechanism operate               in the x - B transformation?  They will answer question (i) by                  instrumenting the high pressure apparatus and determining                       quantitatively the abundance, magnitude, time-dependence and wave               form of acoustic emissions before and during failure.  Questions                (ii) and (iii) will be pursued by electron channeling scanning                  electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy to                     determine the size, shape, orientation and spatial distribution                 of microanticracks and the grain-size and crystallographic                      orientation of spinel crystals within them with respect to the                  host olivine crystals.  Question (iv) will be investigated by                   conducting deformation experiments on Mn2Geo4 olivine within the                B stability field in HWG's unique 5GPa deformation apparatus.",
