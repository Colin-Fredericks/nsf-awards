The 20                                   ft. x 20 ft. shaking table that was completed,                                  and began its operation, in 1972 is still one                                   of the largest in the United States.  This                                      facility has been in use virtually                                              continuously since its construction for                                         research performed by faculty members at                                        Berkeley and at other universities throughout                                   the U.S. and the world, by engineers from                                       consulting firms, and for services to                                           industry, corporations and government                                           agencies.  Although the shaking table                                           continues to be used, by 1985 it became                                         evident that the facility was in serious need                                   of renovation.  In 1986 the State of                                            California and the National Science Foundation                                  allocated funds for the renovation of this                                      facility as well as to explore the possibility                                  of adding the missing third transnational                                       component of motion to the table.  Most of the                                  renovation and improvement work contemplated                                    in these allocations has been completed.                                                                                                                        In recognition of the importance of                                             implementing simultaneous capability for the                                    table in the three transnational components                                     that a seismic ground motion can have, the                                      University of California at Berkeley has                                        allocated additional funds for the design,                                      construction and installation of the                                            modifications necessary to increase the                                         existing electrical power.  This action will                                    provide support for the necessary upgrading of                                  the present hydraulic fluid capacity to about                                   twice the current capacity.  The addition of                                    the third transnational component will permit                                   conducting integrated analytical and                                            experimental research on the response of                                        three-dimensional test structures to multi-                                     directional excitations.                                                                                                                                        This project will elevate the nation's                                          earthquake engineering experimental research                                    capability to a new level of higher potential                                   achievements.",
