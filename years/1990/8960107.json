 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key step in the fabrication of free-standing micromechanical devices          is often the removal of a sacrificial oxide layer with hydrofluoric             acid.  As a result, this powerful technique is limited to use on                polysilicon and a few HF-resistant metals.  The goal of this work is            to demonstrate that microdevices can be fashioned from common metals            such as aluminum by replacing the oxide layer with a thermally stable           polymer.                                                                                                                                                        The P.I. recently developed a new family of polyimide materials which           have all the requisite properties to serve as sacrificial layers.               These include high glass transition temperature, good planarization,            excellent thermal stability ( 400 C), good chemical and plasma                  resistance, and most importantly, rapid solubility in mild,                     noncorrosive media.                                                                                                                                             In Phase I, the P.I. will use standard IC processing techniques to              make simple, free-standing aluminum devices with the aid of these new           polyimide materials.  Phase II will extend these efforts to include             other metals as well as the production of more sophisticated devices.           During this same time, he will determine how polymer structure and              processing conditions can be altered to improve film adhesion, thermal          stability, thermal expansion properties, and wet etch rate.",
