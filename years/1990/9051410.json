 "awd_abstract_narration": "This computer numerical control curriculum development project is               centered around the qualitative improvement and expansion of a                  comprehensive undergraduate curriculum through the integration of               classroom and laboratory instruction.  Essential to this                        undertaking are state-of-the-art computer numerical control                     workstations that are used in conjunction with previously existing              lathe and milling machines.  This equipment permits students to                 experience the practical application of theories presented in the               classroom.  Principles of numerical control are now taken from                  concept to final product while exploring the mathematical                       foundations underlying the control and machining processes.  In                 this way principles and technological applications are combined to              strengthen the students understanding of automated machining for                improved production methods, parts quality and safety.                                                                                                          The award is being matched with a greater amount (132 percent) by               the principal investigator's institution.",
