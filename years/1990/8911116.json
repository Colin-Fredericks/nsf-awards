 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eckman and collaborators have been investigating the                        influence of understory kelps on flow, and its significance to                  recruitment and growth of suspension feeders that dominate                      shallow subtidal rocky substrata.  In earlier research he                       demonstrated that:  1) mass transport, 2) particulate deposition,               3) growth of suspension feeders, and 4) recruitment of suspension               feeders were greatly affected by the presence of understory                     kelps.  For all species studied, growth was greater beneath kelp                canopies than at nearby exposed areas and effects of kelps on                   recruitment were significant.  The continuing research will                     elucidate the hydrodynamic processes that determined these                      patterns and will examine non-hydrodynamic covariates that may                  have contributed to the observed treatment effects.  Several                    hypothesized mechanisms may have contributed to patterns                        observed.  These mechanisms will be examined in a series of field               and laboratory experiments that will allow assessment of the                    relative contributions of hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic                     processes to growth and recruitment of suspension feeders living                in nearshore rocky habitats.  Development of this broader view                  represents an important and logical progression in studies of                   hydrodynamics in marine ecology.",
