 "awd_abstract_narration": "Venerid bivalves are a family of clams found in the world's                oceans and in the fossil record.  Their shells are generalized                  and uniform in morphology, making it difficult to reconstruct the               evolutionary relationships among subfamilies and genera.  Dr.                   Mary Ellen Harte proposes to learn a molecular technique called                 radioimmunoassaying that measures the amount of protein                         divergence between living species.  Preliminary data will                       establish the appropriateness of this approach for future study                 of bivalve molluscs at this level of the taxonomic hierarchy.  If               successful, the classification based on molecular data will be                  compared to that based on morphological characters.                                  The results of this study will have impact in three areas.                 Most immediately, Dr. Harte will add a new and valuable research                technique to the capabilities she already possesses.  Second,                   this exploratory project may illuminate the evolutionary                        relationships among a diverse and long-lived group, thereby                     opening up interesting research projects on their ecology,                      geographic distribution, and function.  Finally, the genealogy                  produced may reveal evolutionary affinities that do not                         correspond to morphological characters, indicating that different               branches of the group's evolutionary tree have converged on                     similar morphologies, presumably for functional reasons.  Such a                result would be of great interest to evolutionary biologists and                paleontologists.",
