 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anyone who lives to the lee of the Great Lakes is familiar                  with a mesoscale meteorological phenomenon know as \"lake effect                 snow storms\".  Lake effect snows are relatively local weather                   events that can cause some areas to receive as much as 100 cm of                snow while other locations only a few tens of kilometers away may               experience barely a trace.  In particular, Lake Ontario, because                of its length and orientation with respect to the prevailing                    winds, has an unusually well defined snowbelt with annual                       snowfall accumulations that exceed 500 cm.  Lake effect snows                   have been recognized and studied for some time with much progress               having been made in determining causative factors.  Gaps,                       however, still exist in our knowledge as is evidenced by an                     inability to consistently predict the timing, location and                      amount of heavy snows.                                                              During the winter of 1990, a private power company, the                     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the                         Pennsylvania State University will collaborate in a joint field                 effort called the Lake Ontario Winter Storms Project (LOWS).  The               project will focus on improved understanding and prediction of                  intense local snowfalls to the lee of Lake Ontario.  The field                  component will bring to bear on this problem advanced mesoscale                 measuring systems such as Doppler radar, wind and thermodynamic                 profiling systems, and a microwave radiometer.                                      Under the National Science Foundation's program for Research                in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI), the Principal Investigators                (PIs) proposes to participate in the LOWS Project.  The PIs bring               to the project not only their meteorological expertise, but also                they will contribute directly to the observational effort by                    fielding two mobile atmospheric sounding systems which will be                  operated by undergraduate students from RUI colleges in the area.               Post field experiment research will concentrate on diagnostic                   studies and numerical simulations with the ultimate goal of                     gaining a better understanding of the environmental structure and               physical mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of                lake effect snows.  The activities of the PIs complement nicely                 the other scientists involved in the project.  //",
