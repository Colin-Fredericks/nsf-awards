 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several related research tasks are undertaken to improve                   knowledge of the effects of volcanic eruptions on climate.  These               effects are important to understand in their own right, and are                 also crucial in estimating the amount of past climate change that               was due to greenhouse gases in order to predict the future                      impact of these gases.                                                               The PI will analyze the past climatic and volcanic record in               order to detect the effects of past volcanic eruptions.  This                   will involve the creation of an improved volcanic index                         appropriate for climatic impact.  The surface temperature changes               of the past 140 years will be analyzed to determine the seasonal                and latitudinal signal of volcanic eruptions.  In addition,  the                output from a recent general circulation model (GCM) experiment                 will be analyzed to determine the impact of the simulated                       volcanic eruptions.  An aerosol data set for the 1980's will be                 created for future use in GCM simulations to investigate the                    relative effects of ENSO and the EL Chichon eruption of 1982 for                the climate change of the 1980's.",
