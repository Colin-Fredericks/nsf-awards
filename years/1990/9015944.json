 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL)              will plan and conduct, under National Science Foundation sponsorship,           a comprehensive assessment and information dissemination project of             innovative computer applications judged to be most effective in                 helping people with disabilities.  Called the Second National Search            for Computer Applications for Persons with Disabilities, the project            is modeled on a similar search and assessment conducted in 1980-1981            which uncovered over 900 inventions involving personal computer aids            for person with disabilities.  The primary objectives of this search            and assessment effort are:                                                           (1) To heighten the nations awareness and sensitivity to the               problems and needs of disabled persons and how computers can provide            new opportunities for people with disabilities.                                      (2)  To identify effective adaptive technology, i.e., computer             applications and techniques, and to stimulate creative developments             to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities.                          (3)  To document and disseminate information on effective                  computer applications to persons with disabilities, interested                  educators, researchers, and the computer industry.                                   This project will address a wide spectrum of disabilities and              take the form of a series of competitions.  Entries from                        professionals, amateurs, and students, addressing visual, hearing,              language, neuromuscular, and learning disabilities, will be judged              first regionally, then nationally to select the most effective                  applications.  Local and national winners will receive awards.                  Information on effective computer applications will be disseminated             to the disabled community and to interested researchers and                     commercial organizations.  A long-term task force will be established           to continue efforts to transfer computer technology to serve the                needs of persons with disabilities",
