 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research wil continue on the fluvial, Miocene Siwalik                      deposits of the Potwar Plateau in northern Pakistan.  This                      involves construction of detailed sedimentological logs through                 the Chinji, Magri and Shok Pathan formations formations in                      several different parts of the basin where there is paleomagnetic               age dating.  Several important 50 to 100 m thick stratigraphic                  intervals in each measured sequence will be detailed                            sedimentologically and paleontologically over several km                        laterally, using photo mosaics and closely-spaced (100 m) logs.                 Paleosol carbonates will be sampled for Carbon isotope analysis.                This will allow us to reconstruct the temporally and spatially                  varying paleoenvironments in terms of paleochannel geometry and                 hydraulics, nature of paleosols, animal and plant activity and                  deposition rates.  Particular attention will be paid to: (1) the                upper Shok Pathan Formation (6mpBP) where there is evidence for a               major climatic, vegetational and faunal change and (2) the                      Chinji-Nagri transition (10 m.y.B.P.) where there is evidence of                a major faunal turnover, increasing depositional rates,                         increasing proportion and grain size of channel deposits, and                   increasing channel size, but no evidence of a climatic change.                  It will then be possible to understand an important period of                   evolution of land organisms in relation to changes in the                       physical and chemical environment.  This study will also have                   more general implications for the relationship between fluvial                  deposits (and the fossils they contain), tectonism and climate.",
