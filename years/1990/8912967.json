 "awd_abstract_narration": "The climate system responds linearly to Milankovitch                       forcing at the precessional and obliquity periods of earth's                    orbit.  But the dominant periodicity of the climate system is in                the eccentricity band, where little forcing is apparent.  Thus                  the response of climate at these time scales is highly nonlinear                and probably involves the complex interaction of feedbacks                      between various components of the earth-ocean-atmosphere-                       cryosphere system.  This proposal requests continued support to                 develop and test multi-component climate models.  The PI wishes                 to: 1) develop a coupled atmosphere-ocean model which has                       components which are sufficiently simple that their stability in                the climate system can be investigated; and 2) to utilize high-                 quality oxygen isotopic records to test the general properties of               slow response, ice sheet models.  The objective of this study is                to differentiate the trends in the Pleistocene climate records                  which are due to internal nonlinear response from those which are               the direct result of Milankovitch external forcing.  This                       research is important because it has a direct bearing on our                    understanding of the complex linkages between the various                       components of the climate system.",
