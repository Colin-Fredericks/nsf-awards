 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to provide support for research on the                         development of an instrument that can be used to measure                        the velocity of water flowing in subsurface aquifers.  The                      basis of instrument operation is the generation and                             observation of a migrating thermal plume in the vicinity                        of the heated probe.  The proposed instrument will be                           equipped to sense the motion of groundwater by monitoring                       the discharge of heat from the isothermally heated                              cylinder to the surrounding soil as a function of location                      on the probe surface.  Unlike presently available devices,                      groundwater flow is directed around rather than through                         the probe.  This provides the instrument with the                               advantage of component isolation from the groundwater                           environment.  Hence, the probe is expected to maintain                          excellent long term stability (years).                                                                                                                          An accurate knowledge of groundwater movement is needed as                      greater pressures are exerted on our available groundwater                      resources.  The depletion and recharge of groundwater                           supplies as well as the migration of contaminant \"plumes\"                       through groundwater can only be predicted given a                               knowledge of groundwater flow characteristics.  This                            primarily entails a complete knowledge of groundwater flow                      speed and direction for the zone of interest.  This award                       was made in accord with criteria outlined in NSF 89-85,                         Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER).",
