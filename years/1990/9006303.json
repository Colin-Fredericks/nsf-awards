 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of three parts: asymptotic probabilities of               sentences about finite models, random resource allocation graphs, and           definability of sets of finite models.                                                                                                                          In the first part, the general type of problem is: given a class of             finite models and a sentence appropriate to them, estimate the                  probability that the sentence holds, for large models in the class.             Also, for randomly evolving finite models, determine the expected               waiting time until the sentence holds.  Various classes of models and           probability distributions will be investigated.                                                                                                                 In the second part, a resource allocation graph is a structure that             models the state of a multiprogramming computer system.  As processes           request and release resources, the resource allocation graph evolves            stochastically.  The expectations of the following random variables             will be studied:  the waiting time until deadlock, the number of                unblocked processes, and the size of the first cycle when deadlock              occurs.                                                                                                                                                         The third part is an investigation of whether certain sets of finite            models cannot be defined by monadic existential sentences with at most          one alternation in the first-order part of their prenex normal form             prefix.  This would have implications for nonlinear lower time bounds.",
