 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both polarities of the repetitive-sequence, multimeric forms of                 the satellite RNA of tobacco ringspot virus (sTobRV RNA) cleave                 autolytically and specifically to generate 359 nucleotide                       residue (nt), \"monomeric\" sTobRV RNA.  The negative polarity                    sTobRV (-)RNA also spontaneously ligates to perform the cleaved                 3'-to-5'ApG phosphodiester.  sTobRV (-)RNA does not conform to                  the well-studied \"hammerhead\" structure, which does apply to                    sTobRV (+)RNA.  The cleavage-active sequences of sTobRV (-)RNA                  are dispersed in two regions of the molecule, forming a natural                 \"ribozyme\" system.  E, an oligoribonucleotide corresponding to                  one of these two regions, acted on the other, S, and cleaved it                 at the ApG phosphodiester.  Two segments of base pairing between                E and S previously have been identified.  We propose a systematic               mutagenesis of specific regions of the E-S complex to identify                  critical nt.  The complex also will be subjected to chemical                    modification to identify tertiary interactions, and a screen has                been designed to identify mutations which compensate for                        inactivating mutations.  Novel forms of the self-cleaving                       sequence have been synthesized, or planned, to facilitate the                   proposed investigations.  We expect that the information gathered               will allow us to propose a structural model for the cleavage-                   ligation-complex.  The results will improve our understanding of                sTobRV RNA replication and facilitate \"ribozyme\" design.",
