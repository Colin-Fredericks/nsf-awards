 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased automation in the manufacturing process has spurred                   considerable research interest in the next generation of solid state            power converters.  These converters are expected to be rugged, cheap            and compact.  These requirements cannot be satisfied by existing                converters because of bulky L-C components and their inability to               operate under all operating conditions.                                                                                                                         Recent research on Matrix Converters, PWM inverters and PWM rectifiers          has shown the following advantages:  complete absence of dc link                components (for matrix type); compact, light in weight, and the                 ability to integrate along with heat sink; the possibility of bi-               directional power flow and low distortion input current.                                                                                                        In spite of the enormous application potential of these converters,             and the availability of new power semiconductor devices such as MCT's,          further development and application has been relatively stalled.  This          is due to the following reasons:  high converter performance claims             are valid only for ideal operating conditions such as when the input            supply is balanced and the output load is linear and balanced.  An              important list of unknowns for the converters are:  Matrix and ac to            dc converter input output behavior is very sensitive for the                    unbalances in input supply and their effects are unknown; PWM inverter          behavior in the presence of dc-link voltage ripple is also unknown.             Therefore, for the next generation converters to be rugged, small in            size and high in performance the effects of unbalances must be first            evaluated and some novel power control strategies to guard against              these imperfections must be explored.                                                                                                                           The aim of this research is to address these issues and systematically          evaluate the converter behavior via mathematical modeling and provide           answers to the above listed unknowns.  Some novel power control                 strategies to correct for unbalanced operation and methods to reject            dc-link voltage ripple are proposed.  Finally, design guides for                practical realization of the proposed strategies via digital signal             processing hardware are examined.  The success of this research will            be a major contribution towards a full scale practical realization of           next generation static power converters.",
