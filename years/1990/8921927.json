In particular minority                     institutions need to keep abreast of these concepts to assist their             graduates in becoming leaders in the profession.                                                                                                                Many faculty of these institutions do not have the opportunity to               attend the Computer Science conference and SIGCSE Symposium due to lack         of funds and a lack of understanding of the purpose of this annual              event.  More involvement of these faculty in this week of Computer              Science activities will provide them with background for encouraging            their students to pursue graduate studies and careers in computer               related positions.                                                                                                                                              Travel support for approximately 28 computer science faculty from               minority institutions will be provide to attend CSC'90 and SIGCSE'90 in         Washington, DC, February 22 + 23, 1990.",
