 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the characteristic properties of tubulin, a 100 kdal                     protein comprising the central core of microtubules, is its                     ability to bind colchicine, an alkaloid isolated from the Autumn                crocus.  Colchicine binding to tubulin results in                               substoichiometric inhibition of tubulin polymerization and                      subsequent disruption of microtubule-mediated processes.  The                   ubiquity and specificity of colchicine binding activity in higher               eukaryotes implicates the colchicine binding site as having a                   possible role in the in vivo regulation of microtubule assembly.                In order to confirm or deny the validity of this proposition, the               interactions between tubulin and ligands binding to the                         colchicine site must first be understood.  The location and                     sequence of the colchicine site on tubulin will be found using                  several novel photoaffinity labeling derivatives of colchicine in               which the photolabile groups are situated very close to the                     interior of the binding site.  This approach is innovative in                   that it is designed to identify peptides in the individual                      subdomains of the binding site.  The unique spectroscopic                       properties of colchicine bound to tubulin have led the PI to                    propose that ligands bound to tubulin are engaged in a                          pi-stacking interaction with a tryptophan in the binding site.                  Associations of this type are known to occur between                            single-stranded DNA binding proteins and nucleic acids but have                 not yet been observed between a small molecule and a protein.                   Dr. Hastie will use the method of optically detected magnetic                   resonance (ODMR) to directly examine the effect of ligand binding               on tubulin tryptophan(s). By employing heavy atom derivatives of                the ligands, she intends to determine which aromatic ring of the                ligand is stacking with the tryptophan.  Kinetic and equilibrium                parameters of selected ligands binding to tubulin will be                       determined in order to test a unified mechanism that explains how               ligands which are structurally diverse bind to the protein at a                 single site.  This information coupled with the photoaffinity                   labeling and ODMR results, will be used to construct a low                      resolution map of the receptor site.",
