 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Washington University has established the Shannon Point                 Marine Center (SPMC) as the focal point for new initiatives in                  research and education in marine science.  SPMC is strategically                located, providing direct access to a wide variety of marine and                estuarine habitats, including protected wetlands, macrophytes,                  estuarine marshes, and rocky intertidal zones.  The facilities of               SPMC provide opportunities for resident and visiting scientists                 to implement research on local estuarine processes, such as                     productivity of various local watersheds, nutrient cycling and                  regeneration, microbial ecology, and benthic metabolism; on                     environmental impacts of petroleum refining; and on fish and                    invertebrate life histories.                                                                                                                                    This project provides partial funding to renovate existing                      presently under-utilized space for use as an analytical                         laboratory to provide a critical link between field measurement                 and real time laboratory analysis.  The project is essential to                 SPMC's developing focus on process-oriented research on marine                  and estuarine systems of the northern Puget Sound basin and its                 continuing effort to accommodate the needs of visiting                          scientists.  The laboratory will also serve as a core facility                  for undergraduate research and training.",
