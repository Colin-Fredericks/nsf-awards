 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate collaboration under the U.S.-Japan                   Cooperative Science Program on a project concerned with the                     role of ethylene as a plant hormone which regulates many                        aspects of plant growth and development, including fruit                        ripening, leaf senescence, and flower fading.  The chemical                     precursor of ethylene in plants is the compound 1-                              aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC).  This compound in                    turn is produced from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM).  The rate-                    limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis in plants has been                       shown to be the conversion of SAM to ACC, catalyzed by the                      enzyme known as ACC synthase.  It is the study of this enzyme,                  isolated from plant tissues, that forms the subject of this                     cooperative project.  It is known that various developmental,                   hormonal, and environmental factors, such as auxin treatment                    or plant wounding, cause the induction of ACC synthase,                         resulting in marked increase in ethylene production.  However,                  the ACC synthase induced in these different ways appears to                     show differences in its immunological and physicochemical                       properties.  The goal of this research is to elucidate, at                      both the protein and gene levels, the comparative biochemistry                  of ACC synthase induced in different tissues by different                       factors.                                                                                                                                                        The U.S. principal investigators in this project are Dr. Shang                  Fa Yang and Dr. Alan B. Bennett, Department of Vegetable                        Crops, University of California, Davis.  Their Japanese                         colleagues are Dr. Hidemasa Imaseki, Nagoya University, and                     Dr. Shigeru Satoh, Tohoku University.  The U.S. group is                        working with tomato and apple, and the Japanese group is                        studying the same process in squash and other plants.                           Purified materials isolated by the two groups will be exchanged                 and tested, and information and expertise will be shared.                       Results obtained during these studies should lead to further                    understanding of those basic plant processes regulated by                       ethylene.  This knowledge can potentially be exploited in the                   control of these processes via biotechnology, with resulting                    significance in agriculture.",
