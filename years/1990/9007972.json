 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert B. Weisman is supported by a grant from the                    Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study the                            spectroscopy and dynamics of excited gas phase organic                          molecules.  This research will help to further our                              understanding of laser induced photochemical reactions.                                                                                                         Weisman will employ nanosecond pulsed lasers to perform                         electronic and vibrational spectroscopy on excited states and                   photochemical products of organic compunds.  In one project,                    Weissman will continue his study of the light-induced                           dissociation and isomerization of azoalkanes. This work is to                   be complemented by quantum chemical calculations in support of                  the detailed mechanism which Weisman has proposed based on his                  experimental findings.  In another study Weisman will use                       transient CARS to explore the gas phase photodissociation of                    1,3-cyclohexadiene.  Additional experiments based on a recently                 developed method to measure the collisional loss of vibrational                 energy from organic molecules will be used to identify the                      factors that cause unexpected variations in vibrational energy                  transfer as a function of energy in the colliders.  Finally,                    transient infrared absorption will be developed as a tool to                    probe short-lived excited states of gas phase polyatomics.",
