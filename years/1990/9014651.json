 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for USA participants               in the 1990 Japan-USA Symposium on Flexible Automation.  The                    intent is to help defray approximately 50% of the expenses for                  attendance at the three-day meeting and for two days of arranged                tours of Japanese manufacturing firms.                                               The objective of this trip is to learn about current                       academic and industry research in flexible automation.  This type               of close interaction between researchers in these two distant                   communities has, in the last two Symposia, proven to be quite                   beneficial, and with the increasing awareness of productivity                   problems in USA industries, such programs become more vital each                year.                                                                                At the conclusion of the meeting, the USA organizers (a                    group of four to six) will travel to the National Science                       Foundation in the fall of 1990 to provide a one-day briefing on                 the Symposium and related events.  Following that meeting, the                  group will submit a summary report.",
