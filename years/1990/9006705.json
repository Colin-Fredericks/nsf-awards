 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diamond thin films have numerous potential technological                        applications due to their extraordinary physical properties.                    Improvements in film quality, deposition rate, and uniformity                   are keys to the realization of this potential, requiring                        understanding and control of diamond nucleation and growth.                     In particular, heteroepitaxial diamond thin films for                           semiconductor devices have yet to be achieved. A multifaceted                   approach involving both experimental measurements and                           theoretical predictions of species impinging upon the growing                   surface, coupled with characterization and modeling is                          essential for unlocking the complexities of diamond deposition                  chemistry.                                                                                                                                                      The PIs plan to develop a mechanistic understanding of diamond                  growth which can be used for the design of equipment and                        processes for crystalline, high quality diamond thin films.                     The kinetic mechanisms of diamond growth will be                                experimentally probed using a hot-filament reactor. Using                       molecular beam sampling to extract the species striking the                     heated wafer surface, the precursors for diamond deposition                     will be measured using Resonancely Enhanced Multiphoton                         Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REMPI/MS).  The gas phase                         concentrations will also be measured using Laser Induced                        Fluorescence (LIF) and Coherent, Anti-Stokes Raman                              Spectroscopy (CARS).  Both chemical and physical transport                      models will be constructed and tested against the experimental                  data in order to identify the main processes or steps that                      control the kinetics of diamond nucleation, growth, and defect                  formation.  The defect structures of diamond films will be                      measured using Carbon 13 solid state Nuclear Magnetic                           Resonance (NMR) as well as conventional techniques.  The NMR                    results will be analyzed to identify the type and quantity of                   defects and will be correlated to conventional techniques such                  as Raman scattering to relate these studies to others in the                    literature.  Selective Carbon 13 isotopic labeling will be                      used to gain insight into the kinetics of diamond formation.                    The nucleation of diamond growth will be quantified using                       Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) to count and measure the                    nuclei during the initial phases of growth.  Devices will be                    fabricated and tested, and their characteristics will be                        correlated with the diamond growth parameters and film                          characterization.",
