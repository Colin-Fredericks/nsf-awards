 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon the current major thrust in manufacturing systems, a FMS          (Flexible Manufacturing System) is being constructed to allow                   students to study the interaction of the many variables in                      manufacturing systems, such as manufacturing lead time, work-in-                process, scheduling, control structures, and part programming.                                                                                                  The current FMS has two major deficiencies.  First, the only                    machine tool in the systems is horizontal machining center.                     Therefore, the system is limited to the machining of prismatic                  parts.  Second, the machining center is very complex and difficult for          students to program.                                                                                                                                            This project will alleviate the deficiencies by adding a turning                center and software that will afford students the opportunity to                program with minimal training.  It will also make the system more               flexible by adding the capability to machine rotational parts.                  The turning center will also function as a stand-alone machine                  tool to illustrate state-of-the-art machining capabilities such as              adaptive control principles and machining parts requiring multiple              tools or complex geometries.                                                                                                                                    The proposed project will directly impact every industrial                      engineering student as well as other engineering majors who elect               to study manufacturing.",
