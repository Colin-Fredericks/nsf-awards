The instrument is used               with the department's Varian 3300/Finnigan MAT system.  Students                are first instructed on these instruments in the fall term in                   order to characterize unknown components separated from mixtures.               Students make extensive use of the instrument with the GC/MS in                 the second term to characterize and analyze products in multistep               syntheses.  The need for the instrumentation was heightened by an               increase in enrollment in chemistry, and the physical                           impracticality caused by both time constraints and caution in                   having every student search for suitable chromatographic                        conditions on equipment which was in hand.                                                                                                                      The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
