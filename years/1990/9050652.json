 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution acquired thermal analysis                 equipment including a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)                   module, a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) module, a module                     controller which operates either device, a mechanical cooling                   accessory to allow programmed cooling, and various accessories.                                                                                                 The acquisition greatly strengthened the undergraduate research                 component of the chemistry curriculum by providing the means for                three faculty, with demonstrated interest and skill in thermal                  analysis, to involve students in such research projects.  As part               of the development plan, students were allowed to participate in                undergraduate research as early as the summer of their first                    year.                                                                                                                                                           DSC and TGA experiments utilizing polymeric materials have been                 incorporated into both analytical and physical laboratories.                    This allows training in both thermal analysis and polymeric                     principles in the curriculum.  A thermal analysis experiment                    based on food, beverage, or pharmaceutical products is included                 in an analytical laboratory for health science majors, thus                     exposing this group to widely used thermal analytical methods.                                                                                                  Longer term goals of the project include potential offering of a                polymer chemistry laboratory to augment the existing lecture                    course in polymers and heightened awareness/interest in polymer                 science from the rest of the departmental faculty.                                                                                                              The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
