 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Timothy Earle, Professor of                          Anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr.                  Michael Kolb will collect data for his doctoral dissertation                    thesis.  In a first stage of this process, Mr. Kolb has collected               excavation and survey data on \"heiau\", impressive prehistoric                   stone structures located on the island of Maui, Hawaii.  Heiau                  were the scene of religious and political ceremonies which                      integrated ancient Hawaiian life and were important indicators of               a community's political and economic role through time.  Although               these structures have been known to exist for many years, very                  little archaeological work has been done on them, and they are                  not well dated.  During his excavation of seven of these                        structures, Mr. Kolb collected charcoal as well as volcanic                     glass.  Both are amenable to absolute dating, the first by                      radiocarbon determination, the second by measurement of the                     hydration rim which develops over time.                                                                                                                         Prehistorically, Hawaii achieved a chiefly level of society, and                islands such as Maui were divided into a number of independent                  competing polities.  Each centered on a heiau.  Therefore, by                   understanding the construction sequence of individual structures                and determining its size and number of man-hours involved in                    building each, it is possible to reconstruct, in general outline,               the political prehistory of the island.  To accomplish this,                    however, very careful age determinations are necessary and to                   this end samples will be radiocarbon and obsidian hydration                     dated.                                                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of how complex chiefly level societies emerge                 and interact with each other.  It will provide much needed                      information on Hawaiian prehistory and will assist in the                       training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
