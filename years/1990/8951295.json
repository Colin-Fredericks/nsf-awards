 "awd_abstract_narration": "The processing of high quality chemical products requires accurate              measurements and control of chemical composition using on-line                  devices and computer-assisted data logging and analysis                         techniques.  Moreover, the chemical industry is now expanding its               efforts to compete in the new areas of biotechnology, electronics,              and advanced materials.  Yet, the existing undergraduate                        laboratory experiments emphasize classical fluid flow, heat                     transfer, and fluid phase separation applications.  They focus on               direct measurements of temperature, pressure, and flow using                    manual recording of data and equipment no longer current in                     industrial practice.  The extensive redesign of undergraduate                   laboratories to include experiments involving on-line composition               measurements using spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques,                and micro-computer based data logging systems is undertaken.  Each              experiment is designed by faculty groups active in research in the              technologies involved.  Six major experiments are undertaken:  two              in the biochemical area, two in processing of electronic                        materials, one in the polymer area and one involving a shape-                   selective zeolite catlyst.  The instruments are also used in eight              shorter-term analysis experiments.  The two sets of experiments                 are integrated into our two course chemical engineering laboratory              sequence required of all undergraduates and thus will impact 600                engineers laboratory over a five year period.  Documentation and                experience will be disseminated to all chemical engineering                     departments in the US.",
