 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to understand the structure and            function of plant salt glands.  These studies will use transmission             electron microscopy, freeze-fracture electron microscopy, X-ray                 microprobe studies, and morphometric procedures, as correlated with             physiological experiments to assess the mechanisms involved in secretion        and the structural and organizational features of the glands apparently         requisite for glandular function.  Assuming that membrane transport is          the fundamental physiological process underlying salt secretion, the            goal is to characterize, as well as is presently possible, the pertinent        membranes of salt gland cells, particularly as to flux capacities,              selective transport properties, effects of selective inhibitors, and            their macromolecular organization as related to secretion.  Since               comparative ultrastructural studies of the different gland types have           continued to advance our insight into the structural and functional             relationships basic to the secretory processes in different types of            plant glands, these comparative studies will be continued.  Further,            studies will be expanded to examine the organization of cells,                  organelles, cell compartments, and membranes in regard to absorptive            processes.                                                                                                                                                      The proposed research is designed to clarify the structural and                 functional relationships in plant glands relative to the processes of           secretion and absorption and to determine the macromolecular                    organization of the cell membranes of plant secretory cells.  Salt              glands occur in the leaves of a wide variety of higher plants and are           believed to be important in the regulation of the ionic balance of              leaves.  The results of this research will contribute to our                    understanding of the structure and function of these important plant            organs.",
