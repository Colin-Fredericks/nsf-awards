 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drs. Wofsy and Bazzaz will determine net exchange rates for                important gases between the atmosphere and a forest ecosystem in                New England.  The purpose is to quantify atmosphere-biosphere                   exchange rates for CO2, H2O, O3, NO, NO2, NOy (sum of all                       oxidized nitrogen), and total hydrocarbons in a mixed hardwood                  stand in Harvard Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts.  The                         measurements will help to elucidate the response of the system,                 and its main component parts, to natural environmental variations               and pollutant inputs, providing data essential for understanding                ecosystem response to climate change and global pollution.  Rates               of gas exchange for the whole ecosystem will be measured using                  eddy-correlation methods, for 2 or more annual cycles.  Soil                    emission rates will be monitored, and exchange rates for intact                 leaves will be measured throughout the forest canopy.                           Concentrations in the atmosphere will be monitored continuously                 at 8 levels from the ground to 30m.  A diagnostic model for                     exchange of biologically active gases will be developed for the                 ecosystem, to aid in elucidating the factors regulating gas                     exchange.  The study will determine net ecosystem exchange (NEE)                of CO2 and other gases in the forest in all seasons, will define                contributions to NEE of soils and of leaves throughout the                      canopy, and will examine possible influence of O3, nitrogen                     oxides and variations in solar irradiance, temperature, humidity,               on CO2 fixation and other exchange processes.  The role of                      gaseous hydrocarbons in the forest carbon budget will be defined.                    Dr. Wofsy and Bazzaz are leaders in their fields, and the                  institutional support for this research is outstanding.",
