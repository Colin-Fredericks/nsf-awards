 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the Department of Chemistry and the                       Environmental Science Program acquired equipment to upgrade three               undergraduate laboratories which are critical components of the                 chemistry and environmental science majors programs.  The item                  acquired included a modern fused silica, open tubular column gas                chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector and                       appropriate computer hardware and software, three Andersen Air                  Samplers, and one ion conductivity detector (which are used with                the department's high performance liquid chromatograph).  The                   justification for the request was to add mass spectrometry to                   already strong undergraduate chemistry and environmental science                curriculums, to modernize the undergraduate gas chromatography                  instrumentation, and to add air quality analysis to an                          environmental science curriculum which was weak in this respect.                The GC-MS system is used in two undergraduate chemistry                         laboratories as well as for individual undergraduate research                   projects.  The Andersen Air Samplers and the ion conductivity                   detector are used in the Intermediate Environmental Laboratory as               well as for individual undergraduate research projects.                                                                                                         The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
