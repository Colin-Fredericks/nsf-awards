 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six students will participate in a Research Experiences for                Undergraduates project focusing on mathematical problems in graph               theory, finite groups and combinatorics.  This constitutes the                  twelfth year (predating REU) in which undergraduate research in                 mathematics has been sponsored by the University of Minnesota-                  Duluth.  Because of its successful history, problems for the                    activity come from all parts of the country - especially from                   former students and mathematicians familiar with its past                       accomplishments.                                                                     Typical problem areas include determining circuits in                      digraphs, complete mappings of groups, labeling of graphs and                   Hamiltonian  paths.  Students are encouraged to publish their                   work.  Fifteen  papers were produced during the past year,                      written by REU  students alone, as well as in collaboration with                faculty.  An  active visitor program contributes breadth and                    vitality to the  summer program.  In addition to generous                       institutional support,  the National Security Agency also                       contributes to this effort.",
