 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Barbara Stark will                conduct sourcing analysis of ca. 174 obsidian artifacts recovered               from archaeological contexts in the Veracruz region of Mexico.                  In the course of previous NSF funded research, Dr. Stark has                    examined the prehistory of this small region located on the Gulf                coast of Mexico.  In contrast to the central highlands region,                  Veracruz never developed into a large and powerful state but                    rather was characterized by smaller polities.  Dr. Stark,                       therefore, looked at Veracruz as a marginal area and wished to                  discover how it interacted with and was affected by these more                  powerful states.                                                                                                                                                Because obsidian (volcanic glass) makes excellent stone tools                   which hold a sharp edge, it was highly prized in antiquity and                  was widely traded.  It is also of interest to archaeologists                    because its distribution in Middle America is highly localized                  and the number of sources small.  Individual sources are                        chemically distinct, and through trace element analysis it is                   possible to match obsidian artifact with its geological source.                 On this basis it is possible to trace the movement of obsidian,                 to reconstruct economic patterns, and in turn to gain insight                   into the changing political landscape.  In this project, the                    University of Missouri will conduct neutron activation analysis                 on a series of obsidian artifacts from a number of Veracruz                     sites.  Through these, interactions with larger central Mexican                 states can be reconstructed.                                                                                                                                    This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how the complex societies characteristic of many               portions of the world develop and are maintained.  It will also                 allow the maximum amount of information to be obtained from an                  already successful project.",
