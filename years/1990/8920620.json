 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the study of biology and medicine and the human sciences,                    scientists and physicians have generally been divided into two                  camps:  vitalists and materialists.  Vitalists argue that the                   phenomena of life entail something sui generis, something which                 provides sensibility, force, function, organization, \"vitality,\"                harmony and integration to matter.  Materialists argue that the                 phenomena of life can ultimately be entirely explained by means of              the standard laws of physics and chemistry.  Like all                           generalizations, this attempt to divide scientists and physicians               into two distinct camps over-simplifies very complex issues; but                these generalizations also serve as a useful heuristic in examining             the scientific goals of scientists.                                                                                                                             In the history of biology, the debate between vitalists and                     materialists, there have been several classic confrontations.  The              most famous involved Louis Pasteur in the 19th century.  Another                in the 18th century was between a British Jesuit, Tuberville                    Needham, and an Italian priest, Abbe Lazzaro Spallanzani.  The                  debate continues to the present.  Every time the issue seems to be              resolved in favor of the materialists, however, the vitalists surge             back with new arguments and experiments to convey the force of                  their ideas.                                                                                                                                                    Dr. Williams, under this research grant, is examining the origins               of modern vitalist theory as it developed in Montpellier in                     southern France and the impact Montpellier vitalism had on                      biosocial thought to 1850.  Montpellier was the home of an ancient              and prestigious medical school and of the sole learned society in               provincial France to compare in scope and reputation to the                     Academie des Sciences in Paris.  Dr. Williams is exploring the                  social, cultural, and intellectual environment of Montpellier; the              doctrines and teachings of the leading Montpellier figures; and the             influence exerted by Montpellier on diverse theorists who                       extrapolated models for social \"life\" from the study of vital                   systems.  She is investigating both concrete institutional and                  sociopolitical linkages among the actors and intellectual                       filliations established by linguistic, epistemological, and                     conceptual affinities.  This study's significance lies in its                   showing how and why Montpellier fosters a decisive reorientation                of the life sciences, especially in France, and encouraged the                  emergence of biosocial thought.",
