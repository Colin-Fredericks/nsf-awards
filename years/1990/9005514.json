 "awd_abstract_narration": "When females of the parasitic wasp Biosteres longicaudatus lay their            eggs in larvae of the Caribbean fruit fly, Anastrepha suspensa they             also introduce viruses into the blood of the host insect.  In addition,         a new protein appears in the blood of the parasitized larvae within 2-3         days after parasitization but is absent from unparasitized individuals.         The numbers of parasite larvae in a host influence the amount of the            protein detected and also inhibit further development even before the           parasites consume the host's tissues.  Injections of the crude protein          into healthy fruit fly larvae inhibit their development to the pupal            stage in the same way as does superparasitism (several                          parasites/larvae).  Thus, this parasitism-specific protein may be the           direct cause of fruit fly development disruption.  In this laboratory,          Dr. Lawrence will purify the protein in order to identify its specific          effects on the host in the hope that it can be utilized to disrupt              fruit fly development and thereby suppression adult populations.  In            the work described in this proposal, the PI wishes to determine where           and when the protein is secreted in order to extract the largest amount         of the protein during the time of its maximum synthesis.  The basic             physiological and biochemical studies proposed in this project will             help to characterize the protein and indicate how, if at all, it may be         exploited as a potential tool in fruit fly developmental disruption and         control.  There are some indications that this parasitism-specific              protein may be related to the viruses introduced with the wasp egg.             Thus, the viruses themselves could potentially be cultured and the              protein extracted (but this is not part of the proposed study).                                                                                                 The Caribbean fruit fly is a pest of several tropical and subtropical           fruits in Florida and parts of the Caribbean.  It is a close relative           of the North American apple or blueberry maggot and the notorious               Mediterranean fruit fly (Medfly), a major threat to citrus in                   California and Florida.  The Medfly and related fruit flies are                 attacked by parasitic wasps that are closely related to the one                 proposed in this study.  Thus these research findings would be most             relevant to these fruit fly-parasitic wasp systems.  Further, since             this parasite is also used in biological control programs against the           Medfly in countries like Greece, the studies proposed here have                 application potential for fruit fly control.",
