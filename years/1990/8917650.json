 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to understand how                         restriction and modification enzymes achieve their exquisite                    specificity in recognizing DNA sequences.  To achieve this                      goal set a enzymes that are related both structurally and                       functionally will be studied.  Comparison of the sequences                      for a large number of restriction and modification enzymes                      shows that among restriction enzymes there are no apparent                      similarities at the sequence level.  Among methylases that                      produce N6-methyladenine there is some limited similarity,                      but among methylases that produce C5-methylcytosine there is                    a great deal of similarity.  Three of these cytosine                            methylases will be studied in great detail.  These are the                      MspI methylase (CCGG - MeCCGG), the HpaII Methylase (CCGG -                     CMeCGG) and the HhaI methylase (GCGC - GMeCGC). An                              overexpressing clone of the MspI methylase has been prepared                    and the methylase already purified to near-homogeneity. The                     crystallization of this protein both alone and complexed with                   DNA will be attemped.  The sequence of the HpaII methylase                      gene has already been completed and it shows striking                           similarities both to the MspI methylase gene and the HhaI                       methylase gene.  A major goal of the next three year period                     is to define in detail the recognition domains of one or all                    of these methylase genes.  This will be accomplished by                         attempting a series of domain swap experiments between  the                     three methylases.  These domain swaps will involv both exact                    swaps at selected restriction enzyme sites and less well-                       defined swaps followed by genetic screening to dtect                            recombinant methylases.  Truncated versions of the proteins                     will be prepared and tested if functional domains can be                        isolated that are able to bind DNA.",
