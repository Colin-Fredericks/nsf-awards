 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Franklin Institute Science Museum will develop, install and evaluate        a museum-wide  Interactive Computer Information System (ICIS) designed          to enhance visitors' exhibit learning through museum-wide visitor               information access and connectivity.  ICIS will provide educational             experiences for 1.2 million people per year, tailoring its information          presentations to individual visitor needs and levels of knowledge.              Exhibit based units will add advanced presentation functions beyond the         usual graphics and text labels.                                                                                                                                 ICIS will include 67 touchscreen-operated computer stations and six min-        computers linking 27 exhibit areas in The Franklin Institute.  This             project is a collaboration between The Franklin Institute and the Unisys        Corporation, which will provide over a five year period systems                 engineering, hardware, installation, maintenance and training of museum         personnel valued at $2.4 million.  An extensive evaluation plan will            include studies of visitor-computer interaction, the economics and              management of system maintenance, collaboration between museum and              corporation and effectiveness of computer-based exhibit interpretation          techniques.  Project results will be disseminated through conference            presentations, seminars and published articles.",
