 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop and apply                            efficient methods for computing radiant energy                                  transfer.  The methods are being developed by                                   drawing on an expanding concepts and techniques                                 from both engineering and computer science.  The                                ultimate goal is to develop methods which allow the                             simulation of radiant transfer in geometrically                                 complex, dynamic environments.  A variety of issues                             are being considered.  The accuracy required in the                             modelling of environment geometry and material                                  properties is being studied.  The potential for                                 speeding up the calculation of the effects of scattering                        by Monte Carlo and finite are (radiosity) methods is                            being explored.  The use of specialized and/or                                  parallel computer processors is being considered.                               The nature and format of output available during the                            solution process is also being studied.  The new                                computational methods are being applied to several                              different types of problems including the generation                            of photorealistic computer graphics images, the                                 calculation of infrared signatures, and the simulation                          of illumination for the design of computer vision                               systems.",
