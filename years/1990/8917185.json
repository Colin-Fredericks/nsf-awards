 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is no doubt that fluids are present in some form                     during metamorphism of most rocks.  It is difficult, however, to                obtain the information on metamorphic fluids from a rock because                little of the fluids is left in the rock except as volatile                     components in some minerals.  Neither is it possible to sample                  the fluid during metamorphism except in very limited cases of                   low-grade metamorphism (=geothermal field).  Theoretical                        calculations using mineral compositions in the rock can give a                  fluid composition with which the minerals now present in the rock               must have been in equilibrium with.  However, the amounts of some               components in the fluid such as Cl and N cannot easily be                       obtained by calculations.  In addition, there probably were                     several generations of fluid that have passed through the rock                  for which the compositions cannot be calculated:  only the fluid                in equilibrium with the present mineral assemblages can be                      calculated.  The results from such petrological calculations will               be compared to the fluid present in small cavities in the                       minerals in the rock (=fluid inclusions).  These fluid inclusions               are thought to have trapped fluids that were present in the rock                at different times during its metamorphic history.  Two small                   areas, in Texas and south-central Maine, will be studied.  The                  results should tell us whether the fluid inclusions can be used                 as the samples of unmodified metamorphic fluids in these and                    other areas.  The results should also increase understanding of                 the nature of the fluid phase and its role during metamorphism                  and contribute toward a better understanding of metamorphic                     processes in general.",
