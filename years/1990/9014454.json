Membranes as a                                                                                                     still emerging area has a multitude of potential applications.                                                                                                  The key areas include sensors, encapsulations, and                              separations, among others which are crucial to many                             industries.  The US participation in the Congress is,                           therefore, of vital national interest.  In such a fast moving                   area, it is important to bring together scientists and                          engineers in a coherent meeting which has an international                      point-of-view.                                                                                                                                                  The International Congress on Membranes and Membrane Processes                                                                                                  (ICOM) is the premier forum for this important area.  The                       initial congress meeting was held in Europe in 1984 and a                       second in Tokyo in 1987.  The Third congress is planned for                                                                                                     Chicago, August 20-24, 1990.                                                                                                                                    This third congress is sponsored by the North American                          Membrane Society (NAMS).  Co-sponsors are the European Society                                                                                                  of Membrane Science and Technology and the Membrane Society of                                                                                                  Japan.  At present it is expected to have 57 technical                          sessions, 2 posted paper sessions, and 1 plenary lecture                        session.  The total number of papers to be presented will be                                                                                                    about 500, making this the largest membrane meeting ever held.",
