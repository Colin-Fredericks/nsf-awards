 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Lawrence Hall of Science proposes to develop a major                   public education program, including a traveling exhibition, two                 planetarium programs, a play, and a kit for schools entitled                    \"Columbus' Great Experiment.\"  Emphasizing science and                          technology, Columbus' first voyage is portrayed as an                           experiment aimed at testing the hypothesis (based on doubtful                   evidence) that sailing to the west was a more practical way of                  reaching the Indies than by sailing east around the Horn of                     Africa.  As with many scientific experiments, the results were                  quite different from what the experimenter had in mind: instead                 of finding a sea route to the Indies, Columbus vastly expanded                  knowledge about our planet and spurred developments in science                  and technology.  These events occurred within a social and                      cultural context that were critical to the development of                       modern science, and resulted in far-reaching changes in the                     population and ecology of the world which continue today.                                                                                                            The National Endowment for the Humanities has recently                     awarded a grant for the development of the exhibits.  The                       present proposal requests that NSF join with NEH to complete                    and expand the project, by funding: a) components of three                      additional copies of the exhibition to be constructed by other                  museums, thus expanding the public audience to 19 million                       visitors; b) two participatory planetarium programs; c) a play                  about the scientific aspects of Columbus' voyage; and d) school                 kits that will enable teachers to present the most important                    ideas embodied in the exhibition to students who are unable to                  view the exhibition at a science center.  Interest in these                     programs will peak around Columbus Day, 1992, we anticipate                     that the materials will be sufficiently interesting,                            informative, and entertaining to be used for many years to                      come.",
