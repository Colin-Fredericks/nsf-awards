 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will undertake a three-year                       program to train 336 middle school instructors in New York                      and Maryland to teach a 15-20 hour unit, Exploring Human                        Genetics.  The workshop presupposes no specific experience in                   genetics and focuses on science as a problem-solving venture.                   Human genetics meshes well with the traditional middle school                   emphasis on human health, fulfills critical thinking                            objectives, and encourages discovery-based learning.  Twelve                    pairs of lead teachers will be trained in each state; they,                     in turn, will instruct an additional 144 teachers at 12                         \"second-round\" regional workshops the following year.  All                      participants will be provided with a teaching kit containing                    text and all necessary lab materials needed to initiate an                      experience-based program at their school.  A follow-up held                     several months after the training workshop will further                         encourage implementation and networking between participants.                                                                                                   This program is appropriate in light of the national                            commitment to sequence the human genome, with its attendant                     personal and social implications; it is part of the DNA                         Literacy Program, which extends the traditional postgraduate                    training mission of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to the                        precollege level.  Exploring Human Genetics follows the DNA                     Science curriculum, which has been taught to 1,600 high                         school teachers in 24 states.  The National Science                             Foundation support of the high school program has been highly                   leveraged, forming the basis of what is arguably the largest                    commitment to biotechnology and genetics education in this                      country.  Similarly, this project will serve as a national                      model for using human genetics as a means to illustrate                         scientific problem-solving at the middle school level.                                                                                                          An amount equivalent to 40.6% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
