 "awd_abstract_narration": "Behavior results from the interaction of genetic and                            environmental factors.  However, it is still not clear how genes                exert control over behavior, and how genetic processes interact                 with the environment.  Dr. Lenington has a fascinating system                   that can provide answers to these important problems.  She has                  found that genetic variability associated with the t-complex in                 wild house mice may have a strong influence on naturally                        occurring behavior patterns.  The t-complex is located on                       chromosome 17 and is linked with the H-2 histocompatibility                     complex of the mouse.  About 25% of wild house mice carry the t                 haplotype, which have deleterious effects when homozygous.                      Depending upon the specific t haplotype, homozygosity could                     result in death during fetal development or sterility, if the                   mice survive.  Dr. Lenington has found that wild mice can use                   odor cues to discriminate genetic differences at the t-complex                  and that the mice prefer odors of conspecifics that do not carry                t haplotypes.  She will now determine whether behavior of the                   mothers towards their young is affected by the presence of the t                haplotypes.  Dr. Lenington will determine whether the mothers                   prefer to raise pups that do not carry this mutation.  In                       addition, she will examine the behavior of a mother herself that                carries this genetic mutation.  The t complex provides a rare                   opportunity to examine the effect of specific genes upon behavior               in wild mammals.  Not only will this work provide important and                 novel information regarding the role of genes and behavior, but                 the model itself opens new avenues for molecular biologists to                  pursue how a specific piece of DNA on chromosome 17 is ultimately               translated into a behavioral outcome.",
