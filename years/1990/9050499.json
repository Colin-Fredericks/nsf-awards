 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department is developing a new undergraduate instructional          laboratory Lasers, Fiber Optics and Photonics Laboratory.  This                 laboratory is giving the student a practical working knowledge of state         of the art devices, methods, and techniques used in these new and               emerging technologies.  This laboratory course complements two lecture          courses that have recently been added to the curriculum, Fiber Optics           and Photonics, and Laser Physics and Optoelectronic Devices.  These             fields are central to the development of several optical technologies           and instrumentation techniques of the future, and there is a shortage           of trained scientists and engineers in these rapidly developing                 disciplines.  Fiber optic sensors and communication/data links,                 magneto-optic storage media, semiconductor optoelectronics, optics and          electronics on the same chip (integrated), and optical computing will           have major impacts on the future economy and science and technology             base of the U.S.  The equipment, in conjunction with equipment already          on hand, allows a broad variety of student experiments to be                    performed.  Novel features of the laboratory include work with several          types of photonic equipment, experiments with gas and semiconductor             laser, beam, spectral, modal, coherence, and noise properties, high             speed fiber optical data communication techniques, acousto-optic beam           deflection and frequency shifting, experiments in fiber optic                   interferometric and distributed sensors, measurements of magneto-optic          and polarization properties of optical fibers and other media,                  experiments with integrated optic phase modulators and electric field           sensors, and computer interfacing and control of laboratory                     instrumentation and equipment.  Major equipment items purchased include         an optical spectrometer, Fabry Perot interferometer, RF spectrum                analyzer, high speed pulse generator, stepper motor controlled                  precision translation and rotation stages, an optical vibration                 isolation table, an integrated optic Mach Zehnder modulator, and                laboratory computer with data acquisition hardware and software.                                                                                                The university is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.",
