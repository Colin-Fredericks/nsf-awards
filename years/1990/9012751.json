 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on mathematical research into                      analysis-based algorithms for the compression and rapid                         manipulation of numerical data.  The work continues efforts to                  improve compression of acoustical and video data, to pattern and                structure detection and in the design of numerical algorithms for               the solution of differential and integral equations.                            Applications to the study of turbulent phenomena as well as                     forward and inverse scattering problems are also expected.                           The primary tool of this work is the fast wavelet and wave                 packet transformations.  Wavelet analysis has opened the way to                 the design of classes of fast numerical algorithms similar in                   usage to the Fast Fourier Transform, but more versatile.  Its                   strength lies in its applicability to problems which do not have                translational invariance and for certain classes of nonlinear                   computations.  Recent progress in these areas has pointed to the                need for designing special purpose orthonormal bases.  In                       particular, it has become clear that the analysis of locally                    modulated signals, as well as the study of oscillatory integral                 operators requires the introduction of bases capable of more                    precise frequency analysis and good space localization.                              Various classes of bases have been designed to achieve both                numerical efficacy and specific features.  Present plans include                development of large-scale calculations which can be implemented                in two-dimensional structures (such as modeling radar scattering                by a whole aircraft including the multizone dielectrics and                     layered surface effects).  Work will also be done developing new                computational tools for the analysis of turbulence data in which                multiscale, multifrequencey and localization analysis will be                   provided by wavelet and wavepacket correlations aimed at                        identifying turbulence mechanisms.  Further work will also be                   carried out in developing modulated wave form libraries of                      orthonormal waveforms which permit high compression rates for                   voice transmission and analysis.",
