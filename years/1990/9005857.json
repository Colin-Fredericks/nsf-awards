 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports two cultural anthropologists studying ways                in which Protestant Pentecostalism and more traditional or                      Catholic forms of popular religion are involved in the creation                 of new cultural models of gender, family, and definitions of                    personhood in southern Italy.  Popular religionists and                         Pentecostals are found in close interaction within the same                     families, kin networks, and neighborhoods.  The project will                    examine similarities and differences in these cultural models by                studying domestic relations, healing performances, conversion                   accounts and life histories, and in the house shrines.  Two                     principal investigators will conduct the research in two major                  urban centers of Sicily -- Palermo and Catania.  In each field                  site participant-observation will be supplemented by survey                     analysis and oral historical methods, comparing Pentecostal                     church members, non-Pentecostal kin of church members, former                   members (dropouts) of the Pentecostal churches, and in a group of               popular religionists without connections to Pentecostalism.                                                                                                     This research is important because popular religion is an                       important force in most of the world's cultures, and                            understanding the dynamics of the relation between newer and                    older forms of popular religion will help us understand how                     religions wax and wane in importance.",
