 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will completely revise, and re-do, the                  Northern Arizona University secondary science teacher training                  program.  This will be done by teachers, educators, and                         scientists working cooperatively to further develop and                         implement already planned changes.  Nine semester hours of                      science courses designed specifically for the preservice                        teacher will be implemented.  The traditional pattern of                        professional preparation that requires a prescribed sequence of                 courses will be revised.  The professional training will be                     replaced by a sequence of experiences designed specifically for                 preservice science teachers, and taught by teams of education                   and science personnel.                                                                                                                                          The revisions in the science training are designed to provide                   the students with opportunities to:  investigate the                            interrelationships among science-society-technology; study the                  contributions of the southwestern cultures to science; formally                 consider how to appropriately translate the science content to                  the secondary classroom; become competent in laboratory skills                  performed in the secondary class; and, become familiar with                     literature in science content and education that will be of                     assistance in teaching.  The professional training will:                        continually emphasize the application of the professional                       theory to science teaching; provide numerous and immediate                      opportunities for the student to apply the professional                         theories in science classrooms; provide a planned student                       teaching experience with specific experiences and tasks in                      which all student teachers will engage; provide time for the                    student to analyze and begin to formulate his/her philosophy of                 science teaching; and, provide time for the students to work on                 curriculum development for his/her first teaching position.                                                                                                     The project has a number of innovative aspects that are                         designed to enhance the faculty of science concerning the                       problems of teaching and learning science.  The faculty will                    engage in an ongoing seminar with leading consultants in                        research in children's learning and in teachers' teaching of                    science.  In addition, they will be engaged in a faculty                        exchange program with experienced teachers in schools in                        Arizona.                                                                                                                                                        The University of Northern Arizona will cost share                              approximately 28% of the total budget for the project.",
