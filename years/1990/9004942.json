 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broad-scale goal of this research is to characterize the                 structure and function of a novel 82 kD protein which was                       recently identified in this laboratory as a component of adhesion               plaques and zonulae adherens of cultured cells.  The specific aim               of this project is to define the structural features of the 82 kD               protein.  The primary sequence will be determined by molecular                  cloning and sequencing techniques.  Secondary structure will be                 predicted and conserved structural motifs and functional domains                will be identified.  Sequences that are required to address the                 82 kD protein to adherens junctions will be defined in transient                transfection experiments.  Previous work from this laboratory has               suggested that multiple isoforms of the protein are present in                  smooth muscle.  The biochemical basis for differences among these               isoforms (e.g., post-translational modifications) will be                       investigated.  In addition, rotary shadowing will be used to                    characterize the molecular shape of the protein.                                                                                                                The adherens junctions represent a specialized class of cell-cell               and cell-matrix associations that are characterized by the                      presence of filamentous actin on the cytoplasmic face of the                    junctional membrane.  These include the focal contacts or                       adhesion plaques of cultured cells, the zonulae adherens (or                    \"belt desmosomes\") found in the apical junctional complexes of                  epithelial cells, the dense plaques of smooth muscle, the fascia                adherens of cardiac muscle, and the myotendinous junction.  These               junctions share in common a number of structural features, though               they also exhibit a degree of molecular heterogeneity.  The                     finding of a novel 82 kD protein which is localized specifically                to these junctions is particularly interesting.  The detailed                   studies to be performed with this award should lead to an                       understanding of how these junctions are organized and regulated                in living cells.",
