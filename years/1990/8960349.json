 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of sensor technology.  This activity focusses on the                   development of Fiber Optic Chemical Sensors (FOCS) as new                       instrumentation for the in-situ detection and monitoring of                     specific classes of chemical compounds.  In particular, a new                   method for the determination of volatile gem-polyhalogenated                    hydrocarbons (GPCHC) such as the trihalogenated methanes (THM), in              drinking and ground water, will be developed and evaluated.                     Candela Laser Corporation and Oregon State University will work                 collaboratively to implement specific chemical reactions in a                   miniature reactor secured to the distal end of a fiber optic                    excitation/collection system.  A diode pumped laser will be                     employed to excite fluorescence in a reaction product; the rate                 of fluorescence increase will be related to the concentration of                the volatile species in the sample.                                                                                                                             The instrumentation developed in this Phase I activity can be                   potentially employed in the over 3,000 facilities in the U.S. that              supply finished drinking water to over 10,000 people per facility.              In addition, ground water as well as specific waste sites could be              routinely tested using this approach to real time in-situ                       monitoring.",
