 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brookings Panel on Economic Activity aims to focus                          macroeconomic research on problems confronting the U.S. economy.                The Panel strives to fulfill this purpose by generating,                        discussing, and publishing high quality, relevant and timely                    research of macroeconomic significance.  Its first commitment is                to produce quality research, and the Panel's method of operation                is designed with that goal foremost in mind.  Its published                     research undergoes a much more intensive process of review,                     criticism, discussion and editing than conventional journals can                provide.  In this process and in the selection of topics and                    authors, the directors of the Panel are aided by the Panel                      Advisers, a group of experts spanning a broad range of                          philosophical views and methodological preferences.                                                                                                             The Panel does not pursue highly abstract and purely theoretical                modeling of economic relationships which cannot be treated                      against data and actual experience.  But subject to that                        constraint, its notion of relevance is broad.  It includes                      research to explore fundamental characteristics of the economy                  and how it responds to policy, as well as more applied research                 aimed at clarifying and quantifying economic relations.  In                     recent years, Panel research has increasingly explored topics                   related to trade, exchange rates, and financial markets as well                 as inflation, unemployment growth, interest rates, and the                      conduct of fiscal and monetary policies.  Panel topics have                     anticipated the recent interest in supply effects through papers                on investment, productivity, saving, labor supply, and the                      effects of taxes and other policy measures on them.                                                                                                             Funding for this conference series should be renewed because of                 the high quality, timely research it generates on macroeconomic                 policy.  One indicator of the success of the Brookings Panel is                 the impact of the journal that publishes the conference                         proceedings.  A recent study found that the Brookings Papers on                 Economic Activity ranked second out of 108 journals in impact                   adjusted citations per article.  Impact adjustment was done by                  counting a citation in a high-ranked journal more than a citation               in a low-ranked journal.  Controls were also employed for journal               size and age.",
