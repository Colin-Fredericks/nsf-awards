 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in the Study of the Role of Transition Metals in                 Biology.  The faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior and              junior investigators who come from a variety of disciplinary                    backgrounds, but share a common interest in the role of transition              metals in biological processes.  The funds will provide stipends                for graduate students and will support research participation by                undergraduate students.  Funds will also defray part of the cost                of the trainees' research, and will be used to purchase specialized             research equipment to be used by trainees.  Funds for an annual                 workshop that will bring investigators from other research and                  academic institutions to the Georgia campus.                                                                                                                    In recent years, the combination of new genetic techniques with                 powerful biophysical and biochemical approaches has led to                      significant new knowledge of the architecture and function of                   enzymes and other proteins.  An important aspect of this new                    knowledge is an increased appreciation of the central role played               by transition metal ions in a large variety of biological                       processes.  It is clear that continued progress in this area will               require the training of a new generation of researchers with an                 understanding of modern genetics, biochemistry, molecular                       biophysics and inorganic chemistry.",
