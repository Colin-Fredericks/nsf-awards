 "awd_abstract_narration": "The molecular mechanisms of early development in the sea urchin                 must be interpreted in terms of the embryonic cell lineage. The                 purpose of this investigation is to further explore the role of                 cell lineage relationships in the development of sea urchin                     embryos and larvae. A multiple approach is taken: 1) Building on                the existing, partially completed database, some studies will                   address unsolved problems in the lineage of the S. purpuratus                   embryo by further defining the lineage and specification within                 the definitive vegetal plate, by determining more completely the                fate of the eight small micromeres, and by describing the origins               of the neuroblasts; 2) To describe lineage changes in regulative                development, a group of experiments will compare normal lineage                 patterns with the lineage of cells in isolated animal caps                      treated with LiCl or fused with micromeres and will compare                     normal lineage patterns with those of meridional quarter embryos,               and 3) To provide descriptions of lineage and specification in                  the morphogenesis of the juvenile echinoderm, the expression of                 histospecific marker genes in the rudiment of S. purpuratus                     larvae will be investigated by in situ hybridization.                           %%%                                                                             A fundamental problem in developmental biology is how the various               cell types found in an adult are derived from a single fertilized               egg. This study will trace the cell fates of founder cells from                 very early divisions after fertilization to their ultimate form                 in a larvae. It will also explore the factors which determine the               fate of those cells.",
