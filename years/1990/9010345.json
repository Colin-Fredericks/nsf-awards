 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) is a versatile                   technique for depositing materials for microelectronics                         fabrication, including metals, semiconductors, and insulators,                  using a variety of organometallic precursors.  In a typical                     pyrolytic MOCVD process, a mixture of reactive gases is                         injected over a heated solid substrate and a thin solid film                    is deposited.  MOCVD is a promising technique for depositing                    thin epitaxial layers and heterostructures of III-V and IIV                     compound semi-conductors such as GaAs, AlGaAs, InP, InGaAs,                     InGaAsP, ZnSe, HgCdTe, etc.  The problems that are currently                    limiting commercial applications of MOCVD for growing thin                      films of compound semi-conductors and artificial                                microstructures (superlattices, quantum wells, and atomically                   abrupt compositional and doping interfaces) are:(1) lack of                     understanding of the underlying gas-phase and surface                           reactions, (2) lack of understanding of the coupling between                    chemical kinetics and complex transport phenomena that                          determines the growth and compositional uniformity of the                       material, and (3) safety issues arising from the high toxicity                  of commonly used precursor gases, especially of the group-V                     hydrides arsine and phosphine.                                                                                                                                  The objectives of this research is: (a) to study the                            decomposition kinetics of alternative (safer) arsenic                           precursors (trimethyl-arsine, tertiary-butyl-arsine) and                        common organo-metallic precursors (trimethyl- and triethyl-                     gallium and aluminum) used in MOCVD of GaAs and AlxGa1-xAs;                     (b) to develop reaction-transport models of GaAs growth from                    alternative arsenic precursors capable of predicting observed                   growth and carbon incorporation rates; (c) to grow GaAs                         epitaxial layers from the above precursors and study their                      properties.  The decomposition of the precursors will be                        performed in a counterflow diffusion reactor to obtain purely                   homogeneous reaction rates and in a hot-wall tubular reactor                    to obtain overall rates.  The ultimate goal of this research                    is to develop procedures for efficient scale-up of the MOCVD                    process for depositing thin epitaxial layers of GaAs from                       safer precursor gases and with controlled uniformity,                           composition, and morphology.",
