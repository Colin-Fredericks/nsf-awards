 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bixby will examine the molecular basis of neuronal                     process growth by addressing two questions: First, what cell                    surface and extracellular matrix molecules act as growth and                    guidance cues for axons?  Second, what are the intracellular                    (second messenger-related) events induced by these extracellular                molecules that influence axonal growth?  To answer the first                    question, a tissue culture system will be employed in which axons               grow on sections of embryonic limb.  Antibodies to extracellular                matrix and cell surface adhesion molecules will be added to the                 cultures to determine which molecules specifically affect axonal                growth.  To answer the second question, neurons will be grown on                artficial substrates consisting of certain purified substrate                   molecules.  Axon growth will be assayed in the presence and                     absence of pharmacological agents that specifically affect the                  function of particular intracellular message systems.  These                    experiments will provide evidence relating to the cascade of                    events stimulated by the binding of extracellular matrix and                    adhesion molecules to their neuronal receptors.  The results will               enhance knowledge of both the extrinsic regulatory molecules that               influence growth during development, and the intracellular                      signaling systems triggered by these regulatory molecules.",
