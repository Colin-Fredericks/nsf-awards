 "awd_abstract_narration": "To simultaneously handle syntactic and semantic ambiguity, we                   propose using the shared-packed parse forest of Seo and Simmons                 (1989) in conjunction with the logical form representation of a                 sentence developed by Harper (1990). If the packed parse forest                 is used alone, informed decisions about semantic ambiguities                    cannot be made while addressing syntactic ambiguities.  If                      logical form alone is used, all syntactic ambiguities must be                   resolved before providing the logical form for the sentence.                    Logical form can be specified precisely given a parse tree, but                 with a parser that provides one parse tree at a time, finding the               correct parse tree requires exponential time.                                   The algorithm resulting from the wedding of logical form to                     packed forests will produce a compact intermediate representation               for an ambiguous sentence in polynomial time.  As syntactic and                 semantic ambiguity are mutually constraining, maintaining both in               the intermediate representation should focilitate their inter-                  effectiveness.  As more information is processed this                           intermediate representation will be incrementally updated until                 the parse forest is reduced to a single tree containing one                     logical form.  In addition, the modularity of this approach will                reduce the conceptual complexity of the natural language problem.",
