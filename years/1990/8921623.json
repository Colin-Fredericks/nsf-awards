 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the collaboration of two cultural                         anthropologists who will interview a relatively small sample of                 North American \"persons-in-the-street\" about their perceptions                  and moral evaluations of the environmental problems of global                   climate change.  A \"folk model\" will be constructed that                        represents these beliefs, which will be compared with a similar                 set of interviews and model elicited from specialists whose jobs                affect the environment (utility analysts, environmental                         lobbyists, congressional staff, and others).  These data will                   contribute to an analysis of theoretical questions involving the                pattern and meaning of intracultural variation, such as how                     knowledge of the mechanisms and consequences of global warming                  are socially distributed, and whether this knowledge consists of                collections of unconnected facts or systems of propositions.                                                                                                    This research is important because concerns about the state of                  the environment are gaining more significance in society.                       Increased understanding of the structure of popular understanding               of these issues, and the moral evaluations that go along with                   opinions, will help policy makers understand public reactions.",
