This two-year project is reporting to the Center's             Industry Advisory Board.                                                             The research is studying the development of a design for                   assembly advisor, which is a rule-based expert advisory system that             identifies product design improvements and redesign tactics for                 assembly to product designers.                                                       A minority undergraduate student is also assisting these two-               year studies.                                                                       The Program Manager recommends Tennessee State University be               awarded $100,000 for two (2) years.  An additional $10,000 is                   recommended from the supplemental program on Women, Minorities and              Disabled Engineering Research Assistants.",
