 "awd_abstract_narration": "Isoprene emission from trees is a significant source of hydrocarbon             gases in the atmosphere.  In this project the conditions which promote          isoprene emission from oak trees will be investigated.  This will               contribute to our understanding of the atmosphere and our ability to            predict changes in the atmosphere.  Isoprene is released by plants to           the atmosphere at a rate of 2% or more of the rate photosynthesis.              This isoprene emission from plants is an important interface between            the biosphere and the atmosphere; it is estimated that 350 X 1012 g of          isoprene is released to the atmosphere each year.  The PI proposes to           determine what conditions accelerate the rate of isoprene emission from         intact leaves and to determine what effects, if any, isoprene has on            the physiology of plants.  Specifically, he will test (1) the proposed          relationship between isoprene emission and photorespiration, (2) the            relationship between isoprene emission and the light reactions of               photsynthesis, and (3) the relationship between isoprene emission and           photosynthetic carbon metabolism.  In addition experiments will be              undertaken to assist in generating hypotheses.  Experiments will be             conducted with intact leaves.  Isoprene formation is likely to involve          glycolytic metabolism inside chloroplasts, which is also required for           synthesis of tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine and valine,              amino acids essential for human nutrition.  Preliminary studies of how          to begin biochemical studies of isoprene synthesis and glycolytic               reactions inside chloroplasts will also be undertaken.",
