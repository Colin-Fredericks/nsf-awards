 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hempel and his graduate students are engaged in several                    related projects concerning the topology and geometry of                        manifolds of dimensions two and three.  The ultimate goals of                   this research are progress towards the classification and                       homeomorphism problems for 3-manifolds.  The techniques involve a               study of the (immersed and/or embedded) incompressible surfaces                 in a 3-manifold, a study of branched covering spaces, and a study               of the mapping class group of surfaces.  The projects include:                  (1) A study of the lattice of all (closed, oriented) 3-manifolds                as branched covers of the 3-sphere, branched over some fixed                    universal link, e.g., the figure-eight knot.  (2) The development               of a theory of complexity for normal subgroups of fundamental                   groups of surfaces directed towards questions of existence,                     reducibility, etc. for Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds.                           Three-dimensional manifolds are the next simplest geometric                objects after surfaces (two-dimensional manifolds), but while                   surfaces have long been classified up to topological equivalence,               the same problem for 3-manifolds is very much alive and obviously               far more complicated.",
