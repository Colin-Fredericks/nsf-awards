 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor                      Richard H. Smith at Western Maryland College will study                         \"Triazoline Hydrolysis:  The Chemistry of Cyclic Triazenes\".                    Triazenes are a family of organic compounds whose key                           structural feature is a chain of three consecutive nitrogen                     atoms. Triazenes and their related derivatives are of interest                  as important substrates for physical organic chemical and                       pharmacological studies.  The results of  these studies will                    afford a better understanding of the mechanisms of triazene                     metabolism and degradation in cellular systems.                                                                                                                 The hydrolysis of triazolines, a general model for cyclic                       triazenes, is being studied and compared mechanistically to the                 corresponding reaction of acyclic triazenes.  The mechanism of                  the hydrolytic decomposition of triazolines is being                            systematically explored through kinetic, product, and                           structure-reactivity experiments.  A new reaction, the                          cyclization of 2-haloethyltriazenes leading to the formation of                 triazolines, is also being explored through kinetic and product                 studies.  This reaction leads to new classes of compounds which                 include tetrahydro-1,2,3-triazines and                                          tetrahydro-1,2,3-triazepines.",
