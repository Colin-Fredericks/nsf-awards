 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                          Chemistry Program.  Dr. Hendrickson is developing a computer                    based system to aid in the complicated process of synthesizing                  the variety of structures that are found in nature or the new                   molecules needed to meet the demands of our society.  The                       computer provides an important tool in making choices among the                 myriad possible routes to synthesize new structures in an                       efficient and economic manner.                                                                                                                                  The first version of a computer program (SYNGEN) was developed                  which creates the shortest synthesis routes of construction                     reactions only by a protocol based on convergent assembly of                    the target molecule from real starting materials in a catalog.                  The program proceeds without resort to a database library of                    reactions and without operator intervention.  The program will                  be developed into a fully practical tool for organic chemists,                  refining the presentation to present the best routes foremost                   and to offer literature precedents on command.  Ancillary                       developments will include several new strategies for synthesis                  design and expanded capabilities into special chemistry.  The                   reaction and starting material bases available for synthesis                    will be organized and used to assess the nature of existing                     syntheses in the literature to gain more insight into the logic                 of design strategies in actual use.",
