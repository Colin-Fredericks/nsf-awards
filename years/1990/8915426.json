 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-month visit by Dr. Selman to Kyoto              University where he will collaborate with Professors Zenichi Takehara           of the Department of Industrial Chemistry), and Yasuhiko Ito of the             Department of Nuclear Engineering.  Their aim is to develop a                   nucleation model which can be applied to refractory metal deposition.           This is important because, whereas interest in refractory coatings              for commercial applications continues to increase, particularly for             high-temperature corrosion and wear resistance, attempts to improve             the process by which this may be attained (molten salt electrochemical          deposition) are doomed to failure without a better understanding of             the mechanism by which refractory coatings are started and the factor           which control how they stick to and grow on the base.  Nucleation is            an important aspect of this process.  The American and Japanese                 counterparts have previous experience in this process which should              make their joint efforts complementary and effective.",
