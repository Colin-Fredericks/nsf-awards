 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thermal conditions under which the evolution of Antarctic fish                  species occurred are unique among the the waters of the globe.                  Sea temperatures in the Antarctic are severely cold (near -l.0                  degrees C) and vary little seasonally).  This project will                      characterize adaptations to chronically cold body temperature in                metabolism and subcellular organization of muscle tissues from                  Antarctic fishes.  Major objectives are: (1) to assess the                      catabolic capacity of tissues for breakdown of abundant neutral                 lipid fuels; (2) to determine the relative roles of mitochondrial               and peroxismal beta-oxidation and the substrate preferenda of                   each; (3) to evaluate the possible adaptive significance of high                corporeal lipid content of Antarctic fishes in the movement of                  oxygen through muscle tissues, and; (4) to identify unique                      aspects of subcellular organization of tissues in Antarctic                     fishes.  Experiments will focus upon two red-blooded (Notothenia                gibberifrons, Trematomus newnesi) and one hemoglobinless                        (Chaenocephalus aceratus) fish species that are abundant in                     waters of the Antarctic Peninsula.  Results will better define                  the significance in Antarctic fishes of high corporeal fat                      content which represents an important caloric resource in the                   Antarctic ecosystem.  Findings may also apply to the physiology                 and biochemistry of less easily studied muscle systems which show               similar characteristics, for example, endurance training in                     mammalian species, including man.",
