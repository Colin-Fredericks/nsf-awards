 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study the effects of household environment and               parental care on child health and stress.  The research will take               place in the West Indies, where the anthropologist researcher and               his students will conduct ethnographic, survey, and laboratory                  fieldwork.  The project will try to measure child stress by                     hormonal assays, and other factors by quantitative observation                  techniques as well as standard ethnographic methods.                                                                                                            This research is important because it will provide a test of a                  methodology for measuring stress that could be useful in                        comparative research.  The information to be gained about the                   causes of child stress, including survey information, medical                   histories, in depth interviews and psychological tests have the                 potential to help explain stress in other situations of interest                to society.",
