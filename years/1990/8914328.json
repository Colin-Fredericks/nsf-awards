 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research contains three parts.  The first part concerns               the design of sequential experiments in which optimal,                          asymptotically optimal or approximately optimal rules for                       allocating subjects to treatments are sought.  Included are                     practical designs, in which external and possibly, opposing                     constraints affect the class of rules available.  Topics include                multi-stage rules, biased coin designs, repeated significance                   tests, bandit problems, and Bayesian designs which utilize                      historical controls. The second part involves problems of optimal               stopping with the main emphasis on derivations of simple-to-use                 procedures that are nearly optimal.  Optimal solutions to some                  generalized secretary problems are also considered.  The third                  part concerns methods of adjusting estimators of survival rates                 to account for effects of random censoring.  In locating                        acceptable correction terms, techniques of transforming                         parameters to have well-behaved likelihood functions are combined               with those of deriving integrable asymptotic expansions for                     posterior distributions.                                                             The work involves the study of the optimal assignment of                   subjects to treatment groups in a sequence of experiments to                    maximize the amount of information obtained. It includes the                    analysis of the question of when to stop the experiment by                      deciding that enough information has been obtained to reach a                   decision.  The work also involves the estimation of survival                    rates of subjects while accounting for the fact that observations               on some of the subjects are randomly censored.",
