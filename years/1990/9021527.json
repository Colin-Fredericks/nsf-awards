The goals of this comprehensive program                       will be achieved by establishing an alliance between                            institutions with a strong track record of producing                            hispanic scientists, engineers and science and engineering                      educators, and which have successful experience in                              implementing large scale science education and research                         programs in Puerto Rico.
