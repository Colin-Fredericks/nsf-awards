 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                   geometry of Professor Gerd Faltings of Princeton University. Dr.                Faltings's research will be centered on questions about p-adic                  analysis and Diophantine geometry. He has recently discovered p-                adic symmetric domains, and plans to study their cohomology and                 construct their Satake compactifications. In Diophantine                        geometry, he plans to use new methods, in particular the Product                Theorem that he has recently proved, to reformulate the classical               theory of Diophantine approximations.                                                This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
