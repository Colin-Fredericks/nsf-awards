 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project, the institution was able to acquire a                     Varian Gemini-300 FT-NMR spectrometer for improvement of                        undergraduate education in chemistry.  Introduction of                          multinuclear, high resolution NMR capabilities greatly enhanced                 the chemistry curriculum in five areas.  1)  In organic chemistry               NMR is bein utilized for structural and kinetic analyses and has                been essential for successful microscale conversion.  2)  The                   integrated Lab program applies NMR to a variety of physical,                    organic, and inorganic problems.  3)  In biochemistry, NMR is                   used for the real-time analysis of metabolism and for structural                analysis.  4)  A new course was introduced, which integrates                    theory, instrumental design, and applications of NMR at a level                 suitable for undergraduates.   5)  NMR enhanced the expanding                   undergraduate research program.  This project has overcome the                  major deficiency which existed in the chemistry and biochemistry                curriculum at the institution by training students in a                         spectroscopic technique that is widely used in all areas of                     chemistry.  It also elevated the level of research performed by                 undergraduates.                                                                                                                                                 The institution is contributing in an amount one and one-half                   times the NSF funds.",
