 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants suffer the vagaries of their environment while animals                   often have homeostatic mechanisms by which they regulate the                    conditions in which their metabolism occurs.  The molecular and                 evolutionary mechanisms by which plants respond to environmental                cues such as light, temperature, and CO2 level are studied in the               Department of Botany, University of Wisconsin-Madison.  It is                   necessary to grow plants under a range of environmental                         conditions for these studies.  Other studies conducted in the                   relatively low CO2 and high 02 level in normal air.  These mutant               plants grow well in environments enriched with CO2.  For these                  and many other studies undertaken in this department, we require                unaffected by the prevailing weather.  Growth rooms were                        originally installed in 1957 to fill this need, but these rooms                 were no longer meet the needs of the department for modern plant                growth facilities.",
