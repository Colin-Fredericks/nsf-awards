 "awd_abstract_narration": "The striped bass is an excellent aquaculture species.  It is               adaptable to controlled environments, exhibits rapid growth                     rates, accepts artificial feeds, has broad physiological                        tolerances and high market value.  Commercial striped bass                      farming has become a reality in the last three years, due in part               to ASI research funded by the NSF SBIR Program. In the firs two                 years of commercial production, ASI produced over one million                   pounds of hybrid striped bass, surpassing the entire U.S.                       commercial fishery harvest for 1987 and 1988.  Major commercial                 start-ups of large-scale striped bass farms are underway in                     several states at present.  The only significant remaining                      obstacles are the domestication of broodstock (to reduce the                    dependence on wild-caught adults from seasonal spawning runs),                  and the development of intensive fingerling culture techniques                  (to eliminate the need to use the undependable fertilized pond                  method of producing juveniles).  Both of these objectives have                  been achieved for trout and catfish, and have allowed these                     industries to flourish in hundreds of locations nationwide.  Upon               resolution of similar issues for striped bass, there is no reason               why striped bass aquaculture cannot grow quire rapidly, to become               a third major form of profitable fish culture for the U>S. in the               1990's.",
