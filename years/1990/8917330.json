 "awd_abstract_narration": "The medium of small pore zeolites exhibits shape -                              selectivity, which has been exploited commercially in                           processes such as the catalytic production of p-xylene, the                     dewaxing of fuel and lube oils, and the absorptive separation                                                                                                   of linear paraffins.  When the guest molecules are comparable                                                                                                   in diameters to the channels, diffusion takes place by                          configurational diffusion, which is poorly understood.  The                     diffusion of n-paraffins with carbon numbers in the range of                    30-100 is important in the lube and fuel oil dewaxing process                                                                                                   to lower pour point for cold weather uses.                                                                                                                      This project proposes an associated theoretical and                             experimental program to study the conformation of n-paraffin                    chains and their creeping diffusion in zeolite channels.  The                                                                                                   experiment concerns the diffusivity and cracking rates of n-5.                                                                                                                                                                                  The experiments will be compared with a new theoretical                         approach, \"reptation theory\" recommended by de Genne for                        diffusion in polymer melts.  The theoretical program                            (supported elsewhere) studies the conformation of paraffin                      chains by Monte Carlo methods, the energy changes associated                    with the creeping motion of chains and the temperature                          effects, and to proposes diffusion models that may be termed                    the \"Snake-in-Maze\" model.",
