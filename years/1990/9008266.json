This objective                                              will result in the first systematic                                             study of semi-insulating multiple                                               quantum wells and their application                                             to image processing.  Significant                                               resonant enhancement of                                                         photorefractive diffraction is                                                  possible.  Semiconductor already                                                have the advantage of fast device                                               speed.  The quantum wells must be                                               semi-insulting to allow spatial                                                 modulation of electric fields.  In                                              the proposed research, multiple                                                 quantum well structures will be                                                 grown by molecular beam epitaxy and                                             will be made semi-insulating by ion                                             implantation.  The differential                                                 transmission of wavelengths that are                                            near the fundamental absorption of                                              the quantum wells will be measured                                              as an alternating electric field is                                             applied across the quantum wells.                                               Holographic gratings will be imposed                                            on the wells using the interference                                             of two coherent, low-power, cw laser                                            beams that can be turned                                                        continuously through the fundamental                                            absorption.  The research has                                                   significance because it will yield                                              image processing devices that are                                               limited in resolution only by                                                   diffraction, are optically addressed                                            and controlled, and require very                                                small operation energies.",
