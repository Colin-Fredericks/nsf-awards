 "awd_abstract_narration": "This college is one of a select group of small, primarily                       undergraduate institutions that has been particularly successful                in preparing undergraduates for graduate work in chemistry.                     Success is attributed to a long tradition of strong undergraduate               research participation and to the department's ability to expose                undergraduates to modern instrumentation.  Through this project,                new instrumentation was acquired to enable the faculty to develop               innovative experiments involving temporal dependent measurements                in the upper level labs.  The instrumentation, which was a natural              extension of previous facilities, allowed the department to expose              students to equipment which can probe time scales from nanoseconds              to seconds and energetic processes from the UV/VIS to the                       radiofrequency range.  The equipment made a major impact on the                 Chemical Instrumentation, Physical Chemistry, Biochemistry and                  Senior Research courses.  The specific items acquired were a                    fluorescence lifetime instrument, a variable temperature probe for              the NMR, and components for the addition of an IR laser to their                flash photolysis apparatus.                                                                                                                                     The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
