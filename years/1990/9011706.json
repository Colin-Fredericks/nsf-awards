Liberian Settler English (LSE), the                     speech of those whose African-American ancestors immigrated to                  Liberia in the nineteenth century, lives as a vibrant source of                 information about BEV's earlier stages.  Within Liberia, the                    Settler communities with the strongest tie to the American Deep                 South are those in Sinoe County, Mississippi-in African having                  been founded there by Settlers from Natchez in 1838.  Further,                  throughout their history of the Sinoe Settlers have resisted                    integration with non-Settlers.  Thus, both the American roots and               the post-immigration history of the Sinoe Settlers make their                   speech the optimal choice for the study of LSE as an African-                   American linguistic enclave.  The present study draws on data                   from sociolinguistic interviews from Sinoe as the basis for                     grammatical analysis.  It also seeks to determine with as much                  detail as is possible the particulars of the American past of                   Sinoe's original Settlers and their LSE and, ultimately, to                     relate that speech variety to BEV, both past and present.",
