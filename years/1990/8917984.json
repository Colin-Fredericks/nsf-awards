 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project employs a combination of fractionation, protein                    labeling, and antibody techniques to identify and purify                        polypeptide components of pea Golgi and plasma membrane glucan                  synthase systems.  This work makes possible the identification                  and cloning of the responsible gene sequences so that molecular                 aspects of the regulation of plant cell wall synthesis and Golgi                function can be further investigated.                                                                                                                           Cell wall polysaccharides are generally the most abundant                       products of plant metabolism.  Their biosynthesis is as                         characteristic and central to plant growth as structural protein                synthesis is to the growth of animals.  Wall synthesis must be                  correlated with cell enlargement; in growing tissues it is up-                  regulated in response to growth-stimulating hormones and                        environmental signals.  Wall synthesis is also a prominent aspect               of plant cell differentiation.  Synthesis is conspicuously up-                  regulated during the development of thick-walled specialized                    cells such as epidermal cells, vascular elements, fibers and                    sclereids.  Thus, understanding the control of wall                             polysaccharide-synthesizing enzymes and the genes that encode                   them would bring us close to the heart of plant cell biology and                development.",
