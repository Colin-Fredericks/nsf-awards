 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves Westminister College, two local school                    districts, the Utah Mathematics/Science Network, and the University             of Utah.  The Network was formed by a group of women scientists                 from Utah schools, universities, and industry to increase awareness             of career opportunities in science, to encourage young women to                 enter those fields, and to provide a support structure for them.                Beginning in the fall of 1990, a group of high school teachers will             begin developing supplementary materials, for their classes based               on lectures in a seminar series conducted by the Utah Math/Science              Network.  The materials will be further developed, by selected                  University faculty and students, for a special summer course.  In               the spring of 1991, 12 female students who will be entering the                 University of Utah and who have expressed an interest in a career               in mathematics or physical science shall be selected for the                    program.   All participating students will take a course during the             summer on the dynamical processes of chemistry and physics.  After              15 months of special instruction and training, the 12 students will             become active research participants.  It is intended that 12 new                students and 3 new high school teachers will be selected in 1992                to begin a second cycle of the program.  Special two day strategy               sessions for teachers will be held on alternate Saturdays in                    September to discuss ways of neutralizing gender bias and to                    provide a forum for developing ad discussing effective methods of               outreach.  The foci of the program are recruitment and retention.",
