 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists                in a joint U.S.-Japan seminar on the topic of inorganic and                     organometallic polymers.  This field is of current interest and                 importance because of the potential utilization of these                        substances as electronic materials, biomedical polymers, and                    precursors to ceramics.  The seminar will emphasize preparation,                characterization, and applications of various polymers                          including polyphosphazenes, polysiloxanes, polysilanes,                         polysilazanes, and polyborazines.  Both traditional and novel                   synthetic methods will be covered, and a variety of instrumental                methods for determining the structures and other properties of                  these polymers will be discussed, as will structure-property                    relationships.  Though the emphasis of the meeting is to be on                  basic research, some attention will be given also to new                        applications of the research developments.                                                                                                                      The U.S. and Japan are two leading countries in the field of                    inorganic polymers.  There is complementary research in the                     two countries, with stronger emphasis on synthesis and                          applications in the U.S. and on characterization in Japan.                      Participating in the seminar will be U.S. and Japanese                          scientists active in polymer synthesis, polymer physics,                        instrumental methods of polymer characterization, solid state                   polymer properties, and various polymer applications.  The                      seminar will be held March 25-27, 1991, in Nagoya, Japan.  The                  organizers are Dr. Krzysztof Matyjaszewski, Department of                       Chemistry, Carnegie-Mellon University; Dr. Kenneth Wynne,                       Chemistry Division, Office of Naval Research; Dr. Kenkichi                      Murakami, Department of Material Science, Teikyo University,                    Utsunomiya, Japan; and Dr. Katzumichi Ono, Tohoku University,                   Sendai, Japan.",
