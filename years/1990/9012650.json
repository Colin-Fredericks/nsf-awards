 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pockmarks are errosive features found on the seabed that record                 the recent activity of fluid seepage --primarily gas -- through                 the sediments.  These craters-like features have been                           extensively documented on continental shelves throughout the                    world oceans and are thought to be primarily associated with                    the seepage of hydrocarbons from sediment reservoirs.  In spite                 of their common occurrence, active systems are essentially                      unstudied and the biogeochemical impacts of these systems on                    shelf sediments and coastal waters are almost completely                        unknown.  The gas released is primarily methane (both biogenic                  and thermogenic) and the significance of this source to the                     marine and atmospheric budgets is completely unknown.  It has                   recently been hypothesized that these systems may even plan an                  important role -- enhancing fisheries production on continental                 shelves.                                                                                                                                                        Following up on the pioneering studies of fluid venting along                   the shelf and slope of the Oregon convergent margin and                         upon the guidance of local fishermen, the existence of an                       extremely  active methane vent in a pock mark on the continental                shelf off Oregon has been verified water and sediment.  This                    research is an exploratory effort to demonstrate that samples can               be obtained without loss or alterations of the contained gases                  and analyses to identify the gases.",
