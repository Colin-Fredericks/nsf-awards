 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies directed at understanding those processes by which plants               control the level of the phytohormone, indole-3-acetic acid                     (IAA), are complicated by multiple problems associated with                     experimental designs using terrestrial plants as study organisms.               To avoid many of the difficulties, a system using the aquatic                   plant Lemna gibba has been developed for the selection of                       metabolic mutants and their subsequent biochemical evaluation.                  Studies of IAA metabolism will be continued using these                         techniques and a previously generated unique germplasm.                         Specifically, inbred lines of Lemna will be mutagenized to obtain               additional mutants.  Various screening procudures will be used on               the resulting mutant population to obtain lines altered in                      several different aspects of IAA metabolism.  Furthermore, the                  biochemical and genetic characteristics of mutants already in                   hand and those recently selected will be defined.                                                                                                               Indole-3-acetic acid occurs in minute amounts in higher plants                  where it is thought to function hormonally to control a variety                 of events during plant development.  By acting through hormone                  messengers, a plant is able to control its orderly growth and                   development.  It is implicit that if hormones are to regulate                   plant processes, then the concentration of the bioactive compound               must itself be requlated.  This research provides an in-depth                   study of the events that regulate the synthesis and activity of                 the enzymes or other regulators involved in the metabolism of                   IAA.",
