 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a renewal of an investigation into the large-scale              and mesoscale dynamics of the eastern Weddell Gyre, dealing with                the analysis of a data set obtained on an extensive cruise to the               Weddell Sea in the austral winter 1989 in a cooperative program                 with the West German Polar Institute, and the USSR Arctic and                   Antarctic Research Institute.  The cruise generated a substantial               body of data on the structure of the upper ocean in winter to                   complement the existing body of data on summer conditions.                                                                                                      Oceanographically the Weddell Gyre acts as a primary area of deep               water mass formation and ocean ventilation.  Maud Rise, a seamount              in the eastern Weddell Sea, introduces topographically determined               dynamics which appear to control the occasional formation of the                Weddell Polynya, a large area of open water where normally winter               sea ice is found.  An understanding of these effects is necessary               to determine the nature of such important phenomena as water mass               modification, maintenance of fronts, deep ocean ventilation, sea                ice distribution, and climate modification.                                                                                                                     This renewal phase of the project includes the completion of data               processing, and the synthesis of the data set which will provide                a basic description of the Southern Ocean thermohaline and chemical             stratification under the sea ice cover from its outer fringes to                the coast of Antarctica.                                                                                                                                        Several tasks will be undertaken: the mapping and description of                the full water column winter stratification of the Weddell Gyre,                the study of the entrainment of deep water into the winter mixed                layer in various sub-regions of the gyre, and the study of the                  oceanography associated with Maud Rise, specifically the initiating             of strong upwelling and its effect in producing the periodically                forming Weddell Polynya.",
