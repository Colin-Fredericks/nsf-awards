Denise Caldwell of the                     University of Central Florida in a research collaboration with                  Professor J. Jimenez-Mier of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de               Mexico (UNAM).  The investigators intend to measure the alignment               of photoions as determined through the angular distribution of                  decay fluorescence.  The experiments will be performed at the                   University of Wisconsin Synchrotron Radiation Center with an                    apparatus that has been specifically constructed for performing                 this type of experiment.  The experimental effort will be joined                by the investigator from Mexico, who will be responsible for all                data analysis and analytic interpretation.                                                                                                                      Measurement of alignment of photoions by fluorescence analysis is               a relative newcomer to the group of techniques that are available               for study of electron-electron correlation.  Due to its sensitivity             to effects of this interaction, it has the potential of becoming a              powerful tool, especially for analysis at thresholds.  In addition              to the application of this technique to the study of various                    systems, the investigators will try to interpret its measurements               in terms of existing theories.",
