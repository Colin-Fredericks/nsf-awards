 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prospect of significant changes in global climatic patterns            has encouraged scientists to evaluate the character of past changes.            Not only have different climatic regimes produced significant shifts in         temperature and precipitation, they also have altered the timing and            location of storms and other major meteorologic events.  If the world's         climate is changing again, we can expect the patterns of cataclysmic            events to change; retrospectively, we should be able to trace past              climatic changes in the historical and paleoecological records of major         storms.  This project will analyze stratigraphic records from a                 freshwater lake along the Alabama coast of the Gulf of Mexico.                  Radiographic methods will be used to date sediments and pollen will be          analyzed to identify the impacts of Hurricane Frederick in 1979 on lake         sediments; the resultant patterns then will be used to identify the             timing and impacts of earlier hurricanes affecting the area.                         This project will serve as a pilot effort to refine and calibrate          a new technique for determining the timing and nature of calamitous             storms.  Development of this technique will clarify the potential for           the use of limnological and sedimentological data in the reconstruction         of environmental records, which are crucial for effective testing of            models of global climatic change.  The project also will provide                significant new data on the environmental history of this climatically          active region of the U.S.",
