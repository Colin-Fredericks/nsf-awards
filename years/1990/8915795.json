 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research into the kinetics of electronically excited species                    of importance to a variety of plasma processes is proposed in                   a continuation of a previous Thermal Systems Program award.                     The areas to be investigated are the chemical properties of                     excimers produced by photoassociation, and the application of                   excited state interatomic potentials to quenching.                              Specifically, photoassociation will be utilized to investigate                  the structure of shallow or predissociating excimer states or                   the chemical reactivity of more strongly bound electronically                   excited molecules having dissociative ground states.  Such an                   approach allows one to access species from the vacuum uv that                   are otherwise difficult to study experimentally.  Laser inter-                  Rydberg spectroscopy of heteronuclear diatomic rare gas                         systems will be conducted in order to investigate the impact                    of atomic interaction potentials on the collisional                             deactivation of atomic excited states.                                                                                                                          It is expected that the experimental program will provide                       fundamental chemical and optical data concerning difficult to                   observe atomic and excimer species, and that the results will                   improve our understanding and performance of devices and                        processes of engineering significance.",
