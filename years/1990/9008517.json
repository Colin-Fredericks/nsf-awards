This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Nathan                      Rank to both Belgium and Switzerland, to work with Dr.                          Jacques Pasteels, Universit\u001a Libre de Bruxelles, and Dr.                        Martine Rowell-Rahier, Zoologisches Institut der Universitaet                   Basel, on \"Evolutionary Genetics of Host Plant Choice in a                      Willow Leaf Beetle.\"  In order better to understand the                         evolutionary consequences of host shifts in insects, the                        principal investigator proposes to complete a study of the                      relationship between regional variation in host use and                         genetic divergence in a willow leaf beetle, Phratora vitellinae                 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), common throughout Eurasia, which                   is known to vary hosts regionally.  Willow beetles in general                   have a highly subdivided population structure, with measurable                  genetic differentiation at even small spatial scales.  Since                    P. vitellinae has the regional variation in preference and a                    subdivision population structure, it will provide an excellent                  model for this study.  Building on his previous work on the                     population structure of a North American willow leaf beetle                     and Prof. Rowell-Rahier's research on regional variation in                     P. vitellinae's host plant use, the principal investigator                      will ask: 1) How do insects evolve preferences for new host                     plant species?, and 2) Do insects form genetically differen-                    tiated host races when they accomplish a host shift?  To                        answer these, he will: 1) Use electrophoretic markers to                        measure P. vitellinae's population structure and to determine                   whether populations are differentiated along host species                       lines; and 2) Conduct a genetic analysis of host plant                          preferences.  The experimental protocol will include 1)                         quantification of genetic variation within populations in                       preference and 2) determination of the mode of inheritance of                   preference by crossing populations which show regional                          variation in preference.  Because the principal investigator                    will use the same P. vitellinae populations for the electrop-                   horetic study and the genetic analysis, he will be able to                      relate variations in host use directly with patterns of                         genetic differentiation.",
