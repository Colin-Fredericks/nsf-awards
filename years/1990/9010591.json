 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze enterprise                level data-sets in Bulgaria.  The data sets will be collected in                collaboration with a team of Bulgarian scientists.  One data set                will be used to analyze the effect of different forms of                        ownership structure on productivity, labor demand, and investment               decisions.  In particular, divers hypotheses will be tested on                  the broad area of the economic effects of alternative                           organizational structures, especially provisions for worker                     participation in decision-making and in ownership.  The second                  data set is on the entry of new firms and will be used to analyze               the formation and entry of new enterprises.  This research is                   important because a detailed analysis of the transition processes               in Bulgaria will not only provide useful information to                         facilitate reform in that country, but it will also have broader                applicability to the reform efforts in other Eastern European                   countries.",
