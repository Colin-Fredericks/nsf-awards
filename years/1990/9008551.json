 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eric Chronister is supported by a grant from the                            Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study fast dynamical                 processes which occur in molecular solids at extreme pressures.                 These experiments will provide important information on how                     chemical reactions are influenced by conditions of extreme                      pressure at very low temperatures.                                                                                                                              In this project Chronister will utilize high pressure and                       time-resolved coherent spectroscopies to study details of solid                 state intermolecular interactions which cannot be obtained by                   other means.  Although temperature provides the energy for a                    system to move on a potential energy surface, the effect of                     increased density is very different since it influences the                     shape of the potential energy surface.  Chronister's research                   will be useful in developing dynamic theories of optical                        dephasing, vibronic relaxation and inhomogeneous coherence                      loss, all of which are controlled by the shape of the                           intermolecular potential energy function.  Since no high                        pressure studies of relaxation dynamics of molecular solids at                  low temperature have yet been done, Chronister will begin with                  detailed studies of pure and mixed crystal systems as well as                   some novel molecular solids.",
