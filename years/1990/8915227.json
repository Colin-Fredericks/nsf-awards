 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the participation of six U.S. scientists                in a joint seminar entitled \"Advanced Materials Based on                        Macromolecules,\" to be held under the auspices of the U.S.-                     Japan Cooperative Science Program.  The focus of the meeting                    will be on recent advances in polymer synthesis that provide                    new levels of control of polymer structure and that underlie                    future developments in optical, electronic, biomedical, and                     high-strength materials.  Previous U.S.-Japan seminars in                       areas of polymer synthesis served as opportunities for                          research groups in the two countries to share ideas and                         information, and in several cases led to cooperative research                   projects and exchange visits.  Similar results are expected                     from the present meeting.  Specific topics to be discussed at                   the seminar include recent advances in the control of polymer                   chain structure, advances in optical properties of polymeric                    materials and in conducting polymers, liquid crystalline                        polymers, radiation-sensitive polymers, polymers in biology                     and medicine, and polymers in composite materials.  The seminar                 will be held October 29 - November 2, 1990, in Tokyo, Japan.                    The co-organizers are Professor David A. Tirrell, Department of                 Polymer Science and Engineering, University of Massachusetts                    at Amherst, and Professor Eishun Tsuchida, Department of Polymer                Chemistry, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan.                                                                                                                     Advanced materials underlie current and projected developments                  in electronics, communications, aerospace, automotive, and                      health care industries, among others.  Considerable research                    on advanced materials based on macromolecules is being carried                  out in the United States and Japan.  This seminar will                          highlight recent advances in polymer synthesis in the two                       countries that point the way to future materials development.",
