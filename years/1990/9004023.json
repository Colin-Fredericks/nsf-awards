 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides one-half of the funding needed to                      upgrade an X-ray diffractometer used by the Department of Geology               at the University of Illinois. The University is committed to                   providing the remaining funds needed.                                                The improved x-ray diffraction system will be used by                      several research programs that need to identify the mineralogy of               sedimentary rocks, which typically exhibit X-ray diffraction                    patterns with numerous and broad overlapping peaks. The                         instrument upgrade includes incident beam slits for better                      resolution and the automation hardware and software for                         diffraction profile fitting procedures (Rietveld refinement) that               will allow  accurate determination of diffraction peak                          intensities, positions and shapes. Current projects that will                   make immediate use of the improved capabilities include research                on the origin of coal, carbonate diagenesis, paleoceanography,                  and the mechanism of mineral-water interactions.",
