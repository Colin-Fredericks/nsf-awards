 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purposes of the models to be studied are to explain cognitive               phenomena and to contribute to efforts in artificial intelligence               to build machines that learn.  The research will compare                        computational models developed in the classical information-                    processing framework with adaptive network models.  Three kinds                 of phenomena will be of special interest.                                                                                                                       (1)  Classification and category learning:  An example is                       learning to classify parts of speech, an essential component of                 the ability to parse sentences during language processing.  The                 learner must cope with fuzzy sets, that is, sets defined only in                terms of combinations of properties that are probabilistically                  related to categories.  A central question is why this kind of                  learning is particularly difficult.  In the models to be tested,                the answer appears to lie in limitations on people's capacity for               selective attention to the most relevant of a large number of                   properties and in the hazards of partial success, that is, the                  tendency to accept a partial solution to a classification problem               when better ones are available.                                                                                                                                 (2) Recognition:  The frequency of false recognitions is a major                problem in many domains: In the health area, false diagnoses of                 diseases are apparently unavoidable; in navigation, actually new                locations or scenes are falsely recognized as having been                       previously encountered; eyewitnesses to crimes claim to recognize               actually innocent suspects. Research in this project will                       evaluate the hypothesis that the explanation of false                           recognitions has the same locus as that of difficulty of                        classification.                                                                                                                                                 (3) Decision:  When selecting among alternatives, as in                         investment, vocational choice, or games of strategy, people often               suffer the consequences of choosing an alternative with a high                  short-term payoff when others would yield much larger long-term                 payoffs.  In the theoretical analysis, decision making of this                  kind will be interpreted as a combination of processes of                       recognition and classification.",
