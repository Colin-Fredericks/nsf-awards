 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to continue prior                     University of Washington studies on mixed-mode concrete fracture                aspects of diagonal tension failure in reinforced concrete members.             Specifically, the shear transfer mechanism, which is thought to                 resist stable crack growth, will be studied using crack-line wedge-             loaded, double cantilever beam specimens with short starter cracks              and various loading histories which are crack-length dependent.                 Moire interferometry will be used to measure simultaneously two                 orthogonal displacement fields from which the crack opening                     displacement and the slip of stably growing diagonal tension cracks             will be determined.  Moire data together with the loading data will             be used interactively with a finite element code to deduce the                  crack closure and shear forces in the fracture process zone under               mixed mode loading.  Mixed mode stable crack growth criterion will              be deduced from this hybrid experimental-numerical analysis.  The               results will be correlated with fractography and profilometer                   analyses of the fractured surfaces in order to assess the relative              micromechanic contributions of the various constituents (hardened               cement paste, coarse aggregate and fine aggregate, etc.) to mixed               mode concrete fracture.",
