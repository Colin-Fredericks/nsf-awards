 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry has recently completed an extensive                 review and revision of the curriculum.  A central and novel                     feature of the new curriculum is fourth-semester course called                  Synthesis that supports a number of new curriculum goals,                       including independence, involvement, and early experiences in                   research.  To be fully successful, Synthesis should be taught in                an environment where there is easy access to the tools required                 for purification and characterization of compounds and further                  structural studies,  The equipment obtained through this project.               allows the department to fully realize this goal.  A graphics                   package updated the IBM nmr spectrometer, dramatically enhancing                accessibility for less experienced operators.  A preparative,                   radically accelerated chromatograph affords separations that are                rapid enough for routine use.  Finally, computers and software                  allow in-lab molecular mechanics modeling routinely during the                  course of more traditional lab work.  With these and other                      available tools and labs that are designed around chemistry that                is conceptually accessible at the second-year -level, student are               able to formulate their own questions and propose and execute                   experiments to explore those questions.                                                                                                                         The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
