 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of the preparation protocol on the physical and                     chemical properties of binary and ternary mixed-metal-oxide                     catalysts are investigated.  Both bulk and supported catalyst                   systems are studied using laser Raman spectroscopy and                          Mossbauer spectroscopy (iron-57 and antimony-121) as well as                    other instrumental methods.  Preparation variables include pH                   of precipitation, ratio of catalyst precursors, order of                        precipitation and lengths and temperatures of drying and                        calcination.  Effects to be monitored include the phase                         composition of the catalysts, the oxidation states of the                       constituent metals, and the catalytic properties (activity and                  selectivity) of the solid catalysts.  The latter will be                        represented by using the catalyst to affect the partial                         oxidation of propylene to acrolein in a flow reactor.                                                                                                           Mixed metal oxides are used as catalysts in many chemical                       processes. They are attractive because of their high                            selectivities toward particular products, including many high-                  value-added products.  However, the factors influencing                         selectivity are poorly understood, the extant processes having                  been developed empirically.  This study is intended to                          elucidate these factors.",
