 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until the development of the ideas of inclusive fitness and parent-             offspring conflict among avian populations, infanticide has been                viewed inimical to the theory of natural selection.  Several                    hypotheses about the circumstances by which siblicide, cannibalism,             and adoption of foreign chicks should occur have been suggested                 recently and studies on the reproductive strategies of birds                    commonly consider the trade-offs facing parents that are trying to              raise chicks.  The purpose of the proposed research will be to test             hypotheses concerning the role of food availability and parental                feeding as a cause of sibling aggression leading to siblicide and               nestling starvation in the South Polar Skua, Catharacta                         maccormicki, on Ross Island, Antarctica.  The South Polar Skua                  represents one of the few examples where sibling aggression is                  mediated by hunger.  The Food Amount Hypothesis predicts less                   aggression between chicks in provisioned nest (food supplement),                resulting in fewer cases of siblicide, higher growth rates, and                 increased reproductive success.  The causes and timing of egg and               chick mortality will also be determined and how skuas adjust their              reproductive strategies from one year to the next.  The proposed                research will be devoted to developing a quantitative description               (mechanism) of siblicide or the importance of siblicide to the                  reproductive success of the South Polar Skua.",
