Five laboratory modules were completed with the financial support               of five industrial sponsors and NSF Undergraduate Curriculum                    Development Grant.  The materials (computer programs, videotapes,               written problem descriptions and instructors' manuals) are being                distributed, at cost, to all interested Chemical Engineering                    departments.                                                                                                                                                    Thirty selected faculty are participating in a three day workshop,              where all five modules are being presented and the participants are             being given hands-on experience with the materials.",
