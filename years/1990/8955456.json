This program is designed to introduce students to engineering as a              career option, and is geared toward identifying students of high                potential who have had limited prior exposure to engineering or science         as a career.  The summer program consists of a series of hands-on               engineering experiments, an engineering research project, computer              workshops to introduce the students to the uses of computers in                 engineering, field trips to area industries to see and talk to engineers        at work, and workshops on engineering ethics.  Several follow-up                sessions occur during the academic year, during which students spend a          Saturday on the UT campus in workshops on engineering problems.",
