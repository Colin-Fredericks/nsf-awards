 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of a cultural anthropologist                   studying the historical background and political consequences of                change in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.  The project will                  compare two areas differing in their experience with economic                   development: Mount Hagen and Lake Kopiago.  The study will                      examine the impact on group violence of the recent introduction                 of guns (replacing spears and bows and arrows), as well as the                  recent emergence of young group leaders called \"hero-criminals\".                Police records will be examined for patterns of disputes and                    violence, and intensive interviews will document the growing                    uncertainty about expectations of other people's actions.                                                                                                       This research will add a valuable example to the roster of cases                on the violent effects of economic development on tribal people.                It is important to understand the local causes of violence in                   order to understand the patterns of violent reaction to                         development occurring in the world, so that political leaders can               design programs to ameliorate these troubles.",
