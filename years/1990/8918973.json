 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project combines new molecular biological approaches with                  biochemical approaches in the analysis of the regulation in the                 ascomycetes.  Aspergillus nidulans, of the synthesis of two L-                  asparaginase.  The L-asparaginase (encoded by ahrA) is under                    nitrogen metabolite repression (ammonium repression), as well as                oxygen repression, both mediated by the positive-acting areA gene               product which regulates approximately 100 different genes.  The                 second L-asparaginase (encoded by apnA) appears not to be under                 this type of regulation.  This three year project involves: 1)                  The isolation and sequencing of the two L-asparaginases genes.                  2) Defining the size of the L-asparaginase genes by subcloning                  and complementation or hybridization and the sequencing of these                genes, verifying the genes by gene disruption.  3) Analysis of                  mRNA produce by each of these under repressed and derepressed                   conditions and sizing of the mature mRNA.  This will include                    measurement of transcript prevalence and rates of synthesis.  4)                Overexpression of these genes in E. coli for further                            characterization and collaboration with Dr. D.G. Poplack, M.D.,                 Head, Leukemia Biology Section, Pediatric Branch, NCI.  The                     significance of this project lies in its contribution to the                    theory of gene regulation, enzyme multiplicity and possible                     divergent evolution in lower eukaryotes.  From and educational                  point of view, the project itself can benefit undergraduate                     student because it can be divided into a series of separate small               projects suitable for students working in pairs or individually.                Each student would learn basic biochemical and molecular                        biological techniques.",
