This award recommendation is made under the Program for Long                    & Medium-Term Research at Foreign Centers of Excellence.  The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award for a proposal sponsored by Dr. Richard M. Swanson                   will support a twelve-month postdoctoral research visit by                      Dr. Richard R. King of Indiana University with Professors                       Martin A. Green and Stuart Wenham of the Electrical Engineering                 Department of the University of New South Wales, Kensington,                    Australia.  The researchers plan to focus on the area of                        silicon concentrator solar cells, primarily of the type                         contacted on both sides, and designed for concentration                         ratios between 20 and 100.  Because this concentration range                    is relatively low, and the required cell area for a given                       power output is correspondingly high, this research will                        emphasize simplified fabrication procedures in order to                         reduce the cost per unit cell area as much as possible.  For                    instance, they will explore the use of electrochemically                        deposited metallization as an alternative to vacuum deposition                  of metal, and investigate designs which do not require                          alignment of one photolithographic level to another, and                        cells which are fabricated by printing patterns directly on                     the cell, thus eliminating the need for photosensitive                          resists.  The goal of this research is to find the ways in                      which such high-throughput processes can be used while                          maintaining the cell efficiency at a level greater than about                   90% of the value obtained when complex, microelectronics                        fabrication techniques are used.  The researchers also will                     fabricate cells designed for concentration ratios of about 5.                   Since the cost of the silicon substrate becomes a very                          significant fraction of the total system cost in this                           concentration ratio, the use of monocrystalline, thin-film                      silicon for this type of cell will be explored.                                                                                                                 The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
