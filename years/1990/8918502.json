In particular, methods for computation of stationary           distributions of Markov processes will be examined.  The researchers            hope that their collaborative study of properties of pseudo-primitive           and pseudo-irreducible operators will yield proof of a theorem                  similar to \"THEOREM A.  An operator is convergent and irreducible               if and only if it is primitive.\"                                                                                                                                This project in applied mathematics fulfills the program objective              of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                the United States and Eastern Europe to combine complementary                   talents and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                   interest and competence.",
