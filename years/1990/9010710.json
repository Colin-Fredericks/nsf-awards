 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that plays a very                      important role in the communication between nerve and muscle, by                breaking down acetylcholine, the chemical neurotransmitter                      released by the motor nerve, and terminating its action.                        Butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) is a very closely related enzyme                  whose function is still unknown.  Both of these enzymes are                     present in higher chordates (vertebrates).  The principal                       investigator found that the cholinesterase (ChE) of amphioxus, a                primitive chordate, has properties intermediate to AChE and                     BuChE.  The principal investigator suggests that this                           ChE resembles the ancestral esterase and that AChE and BuChE have               appeared as a result of a gene duplication event early in                       chordate evolution, with subsequent structural and functional                   divergence of the two enzymes.  The principal investigator plans                to investigate this hypothesis by using biochemical and                         pharmacological techniques to study the ChE activity of three                   primitive organisms -- the agnathan vertebrate Petromyzon,                      the cephalochordate amphioxus, and the urochordate Ciona, and by                using the techniques of recombinant DNA technology to investigate               the genes coding for these enzymes, and their sequence                          similarities to the genes for AChE and BuChE from higher                        organisms.  These studies will provide a detailed picture of the                cholinesterases from these organisms at the protein and nucleic                 acid levels, and should provide information about the evolution,                structure/function relationships, and genetic regulation of the                 enzyme.",
