 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intent of this research is to develop explicit formal                  models for control of flexible manufacturing cells.  The models                 will add considerably to the development of a science base for                  manufacturing, and towards addressing the generic issues in                     control of manufacturing systems.  A direct application of these                models would be in the development of automatic software                        generators for cell control.  This research presents a novel                    approach to control a flexible manufacturing cell, where the                    control actions are executed as a by product of grammar                         recognition.  Each controller will be modeled as a layered parser               capable of recognizing a \"manufacturing language\", with the                     control actions embedded as semantic actions within each control                grammar.  Specific activities include:  development of formal                   models of the physical and logical views of the manufacturing                   cell, establishing equivalence of properties of the FMS cell to                 context free grammars, defining the various semantic actions, and               developing the control grammars for various controllers in the                  system.",
