 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines two important aspects of the theory of                    income taxation that are likely to have empirical or policy                     implications: voting over income taxes and equity in optimal                    income taxes. First, the project develops a model of income                     taxation in which a finite samples of consumers is drawn from a                 continuum population that differs in abilities. Work                            disincentives are present as are adverse selection and moral                    hazard problems. Income taxes can be non-linear. The project                    explores existence, uniqueness and characterizations of the                     majority rule equilibrium, as well as multi-stage voting games in               this framework. Comparative statics are also studied. Second,                   the project examines optimal income taxes when a publicly                       available equity index of post-tax income enters each of a                      continuum of consumers' utility function. The first order                       necessary conditions and the shape of the optimal schedules are                 examined and compared with those resulting from the standard                    model of income taxation.                                                                                                                                       The theory of taxation is an important area of study in                         economics. There is a large normative literature on tax policy                  prescriptions. Most of this research abstracts from political                   considerations. Past work also is either restricted to                          considerations of only linear taxes, or does not consider                       problems due to information such as adverse selection and moral                 hazard. The contribution of this project comes from developing a                theory with both political and economic content. The new theory                 is not restricted to linear taxes, explicitly treats imperfect                  information and incorporates political theory into models of                    optimal income taxes. This is important because it permits the                  derivation of testable hypotheses and eventually the use of this                theory to explain the types of income taxes adopted by voters in                the real political world.",
