 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Silicon Graphics Iris computer system will be acquired for                    research in computational biology.  With this computer system,                  Professor Levitt will bring computer simulation of protein                      molecular dynamics to the point where it is sufficiently reliable               and realistic to allow prediction of energetic, structural and                  dynamic properties of these complicated systems.  This will be                  accomplished by asking specific questions and answering them by                 simulation and detailed analysis of specific applications as                    follows:                                                                                                                                                        1.  Are simulations of proteins in solution sufficiently stable                 to allow the extended simulation needed to sample rare events and               accumulate accurate averages?  Extending simulations of bovine                  pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) in solution beyond 100                      picoseconds (ps) will confirm their methodological advances (use                of all-atom energy functions, a flexible water molecule and a                   smoothly truncated nonbonded potential together with strict                     insistence on energy conservation).                                                                                                                             2. How does the solution structure of a protein differ from the                 crystal structure?  Analysis of the extended BPTI trajectory by                 calculating the spectral densities of each inter-proton vector                  will make it possible to derive a more accurate solution                        structure from nuclear magnetic resonance experiments.                          Comparisons to inelastic neutron scattering data will also be                   made.                                                                                                                                                           3. Can simple energy functions and classical dynamics reproduce                 the details of protein x-ray structures?  They will simulate the                dynamics of two well-refined, high-resolution protein structures,               BPTI and crambin in their native crystal lattices.  Systematic                  differences between the calculated time-averaged structure and                  the x-ray structure will be used to modify the energy parameters.                                                                                               4. How does water penetrate into and disrupt native protein                     structure in the first stages of unfolding?  Which interactions                 are weakened first, the polar hydrogen bonds or the non-polar van               der Waals' interactions?   How rapidly do such \"unfolding\"                      fluctuations occur under normal and denaturing conditions?  They                will investigate the stability of native BPTI in solution as                    temperature, density (equivalent to pressure) and patterns of                   disulphide bonding are changed. These methods will also be used                 on simpler systems such as alpha-helices and beta-hairpins in                   solution.                                                                                                                                                       5.  By what path and at what rate are water molecules expelled                  from protein binding sites?  They will apply these methods to                   larger proteins, ribonuclease and the trypsin/BPTI complex, which               are also being studied experimentally.",
