This equipment is                    maintained for use on or in association with the four                           research vessels operated by the institution.  A substantial                    part of the ships' operating schedules during 1990 is in                        support of NSF-sponsored research projects.  The instrumenta-                   tion will also increase the capabilities of the ships and of                    the institution to support research and engineering                             activities.  The instrumentation includes:                                                                                                                      -Shipboard data management systems and components for real-                      time acquisition, management, analysis, and display of large                    environmental data sets,                                                       -Echosounder system for collecting data on seafloor                              bathymetry and sedimentary profiles,                                           -CTD enhancements for obtaining detailed profiles of seawater                    conductivity and temperature as a function of depth,                           -Seagoing analytical laboratory upgrades for improving                           dissolved oxygen and salinity measurements,                                    -Portable fume hoods for removing chemical fumes from the                        ship's laboratories, and                                                       -Shipping containers for safely transporting delicate                            scientific equipment to and from the ships.                                                                                                                    The University of California is cost sharing in the                             acquisition of this equipment.  The instrumentation described                   above will increase the capability of the organization to                       support NSF-sponsored research and engineering projects.",
