 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cheilostome bryozoans are colonial marine invertebrates that               are a common constituent of post-Paleozoic seas.  The individual                polyps that comprise the colony are capable of differentiating                  into several different \"heteromorphs\", each of which serves a                   distinct function that benefits the colony (e.g., protection from               encrusting competitors).  Biologists have tended to rely on the                 characteristics of individual zooids (within which polyps                       reside) in distinguishing species and constructing                              classifications.  Dr. Scott Lidgard proposes a study of both                    zooid- and colony-level features, for the purpose of establishing               their relative value in unravelling evolutionary relationships in               a genus of fossil cheilostomes.  Dr. Lidgard will use the most                  current techniques of computer-based image analysis and                         phylogenetic reconstruction.                                                         The proposed research has implications beyond                              paleontologists interested in bryozoan classification.  The focus               on colony-level organization is relevant to botanists and                       invertebrate zoologists interested in corals, sponges, and other                colonial groups.  The results of this study will suggest whether                or not the colony-level of integration has a significant effect                 on the evolutionary history of these groups, and on the way                     research is conducted on them.",
