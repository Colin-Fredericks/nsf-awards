 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the Science Communications Project is to have the                    undergraduate students experience how to approach a scientific problem          while learning how information is communicated in science. Students are         required to write a research proposal, design and perform an                    independent team project, write a research report, and conduct a poster         session at the end of the semester. Also required are peer reviews of           other teams' proposals and reports. The purchase of a dual-beam                 spectrophotometer with a computer linkage is expanding the research             capabilities of the students and accelerating their progress. The               instrument is used primarily for enzyme activity assays and protein             determinations. This program is more akin to real biological science            than the standard cookbook laboratory experience in which the results           are known ahead of time. The college is contributing an amount equal            to the award.",
