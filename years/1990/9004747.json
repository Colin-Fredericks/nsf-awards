 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study addresses the role of mafic and intermediate-                        composition magmas in the genesis of rhyolites at the Tomochic                  volcanic center (TVC), where the stratigraphic section is the                   most complete and where the history of volcanism is best                        documented among known eruptive centers in the Sierra Madre                     Occidental.  Recent field and chronologic work at the TVC has                   indicated that two distinct lithologies, porphyritic two-pyroxene               andesite and crystal-poor basaltic andesite, were important                     components of the magma systems that fed large-volume rhyolite                  ash-flow eruptions.  A genetic relationship between these                       lithologies and the rhyolites is allowed, but is poorly                         constrained, by available data.  The principal goal of this study               will be to evaluate that relationship further, via:                             (a)comparison and modeling of mineralogic, isotopic (Sr, Nd), and               geochemical variations among all rock types, and                                (b) petrologic study of hybrid post-collapse lavas, to                          characterize the deep, mafic parts of the reservoir beneath the                 Las Varas caldera, for comparison with extruded basaltic                        andesite.                                                                       Results will constrain model pertaining to the genesis of                       rhyolites, and of associated, more mafic magmas, in what is                     considered the world's largest \"rhyolite-dominated\"volcanic                     field.  Results will also be important to models linking style of               volcanism with tectonic regime, and to our understanding of                     processes associated with the evolution of large-volume                         subcaldera reservoirs.",
