 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for a Research Planning Grant examines adaptation in              the training and development within organizations.  Changes in the              demographic composition and the skill/knowledge base of the labor               force suggest that organizaitons will need to focus more of their               management activities on training and development.  These changes               also suggest that organizations will need to take an interactionist             approach to training, i.e., adapting the training method or content             to meet the needs and aptitutes of individduals in the workforce.               Little research has been done in organizational training                        environments on how to adapt training in this fashion.                                                                                                          Research in cognitive psychology and education provides a                       foundation for theoretical work in this area.  This research                    suggests that aptitudes andmethods do interact and can enhance                  performacne both for individuals and for organizations.  The                    planned research involves building on the research in cognitive                 psychology and education, developing theoretically-based                        hypotheses, and proposing a series of studies to test these                     research hypotheses.  In the long run, this investigation will lead             to insights into adaptive approaches to training and development.",
