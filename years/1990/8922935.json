 "awd_abstract_narration": "A bio-optical model was developed to predict phytoplankton                      production from field measurements of spectral irrdiance and                    pigmentation combined with testable assumptions regarding cell                  absorption and spectral quantum yield (0y). Laboratory testing of               the model will probe the spectral relationships between                         photosynthetically absorbed radiation (Qphar), quantum yield )0,                production/Qphar) and rates of primary produtivity for different                size classes and spectral groups of phytoplankton. The model                    derives cell absorption from spectral reconstructions based on                  chlorophyll and accessory pigment concentrations. Spectral                      comparisons of reconstructed versus direct measurements of                      absorbance provide means of distinguishing the wavelength-                      dependent contribution of photosynthetic and/or photoprotective                 pigments to algal absorption from those of cell packaging effects               and non-algal matter in the surrounding water. Errors in                        estimations of in vivo maximum (0max) and spectral (0y) quantum                 yield are of greatest significant to accurate bio-optical                       predictions of primary production. Dr. Prezelin will identify the               sources and magnitude of variability in phytoplankton spectral                  properties which determine quantum yield. Results would provide                 insights into how different sized and spectrally diverse                        phytoplankton utilize radiant energy, influence the spectral                    characteristics of water-column optical properties, and regulate                rates of photosynthesis and photoinhibition. Results would                      improve current and future field applications for this and                      similar bio-optical models intended to examine and predict                      temporal/spatial variability in primary productivity in marine                  environments.",
