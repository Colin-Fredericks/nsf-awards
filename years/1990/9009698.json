The Soviet Union is experiencing unprecedented political reform.                These reforms are producing corresponding changes in the relations              between political institutions and the public.  Because the                     individual citizen is playing an expanded civic role, survey                    research is essential for understanding the new politics emerging in            the Soviet Union.  This project entails research on political                   attitudes and political participation among the citizens in three               Soviet republics:  the Russian Federation, Estonia and the Ukraine.             The study involves interviews with 1600 Soviet citizens and is                  conducted in cooperation with scholars from the Center for Political            and International Studies in Moscow.                                                                                                                            It is critical that this research be done as soon as possible.                  Scholars have never before had an opportunity to study the                      democratization of a communist political system.  Researchers must              act quickly to establish a baseline measure of public opinion before            too much change occurs.  Moreover, if this project is delayed, future           events, such as political turmoil, might make it impossible to                  conduct systematic rigorous surveys.  All materials will be                     catalogued and archived for use by other social scientists interested           in studying political change in the Soviet Union.                                                                                                               The project should add considerably to our understanding of the                 democratization process in a communist political system.",
