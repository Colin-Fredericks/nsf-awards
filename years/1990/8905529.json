 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supernovae are the most energetic stellar explosions known,                     capable of ejecting matter at thousands of kilometers per second                into their environment.  The ejected matter expands with                        supersonic speed, compresses interstellar gas, and enriches it                  with heavy elements that was synthesized by the parent star.                                                                                                    The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with his                   observational research, previously funded by NSF, on supernovae                 and supernova remnants.   He will be using the new generation of                solid-state imagers and spectrometers available at the National                 Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) and at other observatories.                In particular, the PI will study the events in the evolution of                 massive stars that lead up to supernova explosions and the                      effects such explosions have on the interstellar medium in our                  and other nearby galaxies.  Answers will be sought to such issues               as the frequency of and energy released by supernovae, the rate                 of expansion of supernova ejecta, the chemical evolution of                     galaxies, and the frequency of star formation.  Special attention               will be accorded to Supernova 1987A, whose explosion was observed               in February 1987 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  Model                          atmospheres and brightness observations of supernovae will be                   used to measure distances to nearby galaxies.",
