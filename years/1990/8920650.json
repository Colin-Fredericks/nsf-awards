 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many commercially important chemicals are produced by the                       reaction of a volatile and a nonvolatile component on a                         supported catalyst.  A large fraction of these actions are                      oxidations and hydrogenations of organic compounds over                         precious metal and nickel catalysts.  Such reactions are an                     important step in the production of specialty chemicals (for                    example aniline and crotonaldehyde) and biochemicals (for                       example hydrogenated vegetable oils and xylose).  In addition                   to being multiphase in nature, these reactions are typically                    fast (mass transport limited) and quite exothermic.  The                        reaction heat can lead to liquid-phase vaporization both                        within the catalyst pellet pores and on the external surface.                   The gas-phase catalytic reaction occurring in the gas-filled                    pores can result in a large rise in the intraparticle                           temperature and pressure.  The overall rate may also increase                   substantially as a result of the phase change and gas-phase                     catalytic reaction.  Undesirable high temperature excursions                    (hot spots) within a catalytic reactor may result.  These                       single pellet phenomena complicate the design and control of                    multiphase catalytic reactors.  With a better understanding of                  these systems new types of multiphase reactor operations and                    designs can be developed in which the beneficial influence of                   the nonisothermal phenomena is exploited or the detrimental                     impact is avoided.                                                                                                                                              The PI is planning a fundamental experimental and modelling                     study of the behavior of a single supported catalytic pellet                    in an exothermic multiphase reaction system.  The single                        pellet or even single pore level often dictates the overall                     reactor behavior.  Two experiments involving cyclohexene                        hydrogenation on a supported palladium pellet are planned.  In                  the first experiment the pellet is suspended in a tube and                      contacted by a flowing liquid film and annular gas flow.  The                   overall, rate, degree of external wetting, pellet mass, and                     the pellet temperature will be monitored as various bulk                        conditions are changed.  The dependence of the overall rate,                    temperature rise, and the degree of internal and external                       wetting on the bulk conditions will be determined as phase                      change occurs.  In the second experiment a novel  multiphase                    diffusion and reaction cell will be developed to study in more                  detail the intraparticle temperature profile.  The single                       pellet is wetted on one face by the liquid and on the other by                  the gas.  The large differences of temperature rise in gas-                     and liquid-filled catalyst pellets provides a means of probing                  the location of gas- or liquid-fill pores.  Development and                     numerical solution of several pertinent models of the single,                   partially wetted and filled catalytic pellet will be carried                    out.  The research should provide fundamental data to be                        ultimately used in multiphase reactor design.",
