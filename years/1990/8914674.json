 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in developmental                 biology between Dr. Marcia Ontell, University of Pittsburgh and Dr.             Margaret Buckingham, Pasteur Institute, Paris, France.  The                     objective of the project is to investigate the influence of                     innervation on the pattern of expression of contractile protein in              developing skeletal muscles of mice.  Fetal muscle organogenesis is             characterized by successive waves of myogenesis, resulting in a                 heterogenous population of myotubes.  Effective analysis of muscle              differentiation, including the sequential expression of genes                   coding for the mRNAs for sarcomeric proteins, must be carried out               with the collaborative efforts of laboratories skilled in molecular             biology and in morphological analysis.                                                                                                                          In this project Dr. Buckingham will prepare nuclear extracts to study           nuclear protein binding to muscle gene regulatory sequences and                 will study in vitro transcription of mRNAs coding for actin and                 myosin in normal murine muscle and in fetally denervated muscle,                obtained from Dr. Ontell, as well as in muscle from transgenic                  mice.  Dr. Ontell has developed new techniques, permitting transient            or permanent denervation of developing mouse muscle.  She will                  evaluate these muscles and when appropriate, the muscles of                     transgenic mice provided by Dr. Buckingham, with electron microscopy            and quantitative morphometery.  She will also investigate, with in              situ hybridization, the actin and myosin mRNAs (at the single myotube           level, with light and electron microscopic correlation) in normal               developing murine muscles, in fetally deneverated muscles, and in               transgenic mouse muscles using cRNA probes developed immunocyto-                chemical and gel electrophoretic techniques.   This project may                 lead to new information, regarding the genetic control of muscle                development and maturation and the effect that innervation may have             on the developmental program.",
