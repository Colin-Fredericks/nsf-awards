 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing use of modern household fuels in developing countries           undergoing rapid urbanization poses serious economic and environmental          problems.  Theoretical frameworks and practical tools to assist                 planners in addressing these problems have been limited and                     contradictory.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine two            factors that are particularly relevant to the use of fuels in Third             World urban households but that have not been addressed adequately in           previous research:  commercial activity in the home and the value of            women's time.  It will also identify potential policy measures to               influence household demand through the quality of appliance technology,         instead of through the more conventional price approaches.  The                 project will use survey questionnaires administered to randomly                 selected households in three cities in Thailand.  Socio-economic and            energy-use data from the surveys will be supplemented by measurements           of individual appliance electricity use in representative homes.  Semi-         structured interviews with appliance industry representatives and               government authorities will provide background for a qualitative                assessment of the market, the structure of the industry, and the                potential for technological changes to increase energy efficiency.              Statistical tests will be used to isolate the influence of specific             factors of interest while controlling for others.                                                                                                                    This research will identify socio-economic, behavioral, and                physical characteristics of urban households that are related to the            choice and quantity of fuels used in households.  These data will be            used to identify the factors driving the rapid changes in the household         use of energy resources that are taking place in Third World cities and         to pinpoint the ways in which those factors are amenable to policy              influence.  The theoretically grounded answers to these questions of            household energy use are of enormous practical significance for                 planners and policy makers concerned with urban growth, environmental           quality, and economic planning in developing countries.  The project            also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young                scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
