 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do people know whether they can give an answer before                       actually searching memory for it?  This research will explore the               role of \"feeling of knowing\" in strategy selection:  Do humans                  have a feeling of knowing process that operates fast enough to                  indicate whether desired information is likely to be stored in                  memory?  Does this process affect whether people search memory                  for a specific fact, resort to reasoning processes, or simply                   give up with an \"I don't know\" response?   In order to understand               how the feeling of knowing process works, this research will also               investigate whether activation and priming of memory affect                     feeling of knowing judgments and whether activation enhances                    memory retrieval itself, or merely biases search processes.                     Finally, the research will address how plausible reasoning is                   done when search for a fact is not the strategy of choice.                                                                                                      The research will develop in three stages: (a) five experiments                 will ask what factors affect feeling of knowing and whether                     priming enhances memory retrieval, (b) five experiments will ask                how feeling of knowing affects question-answering strategy                      selection, and (c) six experiments will ask what affects                        plausible reasoning and whether it is done automatically during                 reading.  To answer these questions, the research will use a                    number of methodologies.  These will include a gameshow paradigm,               in which people must determine rapidly whether they can answer a                question prior to attempting to answer it, a deadline experiment,               in which people must select rapidly the type of question-                       answering strategy preferred to answer a specific question, a                   variable deadline paradigm, in which people are trained to                      respond immediately after a signal that can come at any time                    after the presentation of the stimulus (and the dependent measure               is thus accuracy), plausibility ratings, and simple two-                        alternative, choice-reaction-time studies.                                                                                                                      A complete model of question answering and strategy choice may                  suggest important improvements in data base search and query                    systems for very large artificial data bases.  Work that attempts               to understand feeling of knowing processes will be important for                understanding clinical cases of memory impairment that include                  impaired feeling of knowing processes and those that do not.",
