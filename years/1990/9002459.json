The lifeline systems gaslines, sewer lines                                      electric transmission and power systems etc.                                    in the San Francisco area sustained                                             considerable damage and service disruption                                      during the October 17, 1989 earthquake.  As a                                   result it provides excellent opportunity to                                     assess the safety and service operation of                                      such vital systems, which service the city and                                  community.  this project is to collect and                                      evaluate data resulting from this particular                                    earthquake or endurance and damage of water                                     and sewage facilities.
