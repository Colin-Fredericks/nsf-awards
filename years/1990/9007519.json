 "awd_abstract_narration": "Simultaneous, instantaneous images of the fuel, air, and                        reaction intermediates will be made with an intensified                         charge-coupled digital camera in a turbulent diffusion flame                    by Raman scattering and fluorescence induced with an                            ultraviolet(UV) excimer laser.  The imaging technique is based                  on recent advances in Raman scattering and laser-induced                        predissociative fluorescence (LIPF) using UV excimer lasers.                    The images can assess finite rate chemistry effects - the                       effect of gradients of fuel and air on the chemistry of the                     turbulent flame.  These finite-rate chemistry effects                           determine combustion efficiency and pollution formation in                      flames.  From the images, the finite-rate chemistry in                          turbulent diffusion flames can be quantified so that computer                   models of turbulence-chemistry interactions can be improved.                                                                                                    This proposal is to acquire the imaging equipment necessary to                  measure the gradients of temperature, mixture fraction, and                     minor species (OH) in a turbulent diffusion flame by imaging                    Raman and fluorescence signals from a narrowband excimer                        laser.  The photomultiplier tubes used in the point                             measurements would be replaced by a gated intensified (ICCD)                    camera.",
