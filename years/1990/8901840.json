 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is concerned with the evaluation of the size of the                  repertoire of monoclonal antibodies to a (1-6) dextran.  The                    contribution to antibody diversity and specificity in this system               of individual complementarty defe mining regions (CDRs will be                  explored by site-directed mutagenesis replacing individualCDRs by               glycines and then restoring the original CDR residues, one or two               at a time.  Fine structures of sites will be characterized by                   parameters such as size and shape, cavity vs. groove-type sites,                association constants, relative contribution of each sugar in the               epitope to binding including the use of fluorinated mono-and                    oligosaccharides.  The repertoire of anti-idiotypic and anti-                   antiidiotypic antibodies inluding internal image antibodies will                be defined.  All these parameters will be correlated with                       derived amino acid sequences.  Molecular modeling of other                      hybridomas established by immunochemical data to have cavity and                groove-type sites will be continued.                                                                                                                            A human antibody repertoire of an individual who has been studies               over forty-five years with respect to antibodies to various                     antigens, will be transferred to severe combined immuno deficient               (SCID) mice to evaluate various responses to renewed                            immunization.                                                                                                                                                   An attempt will be made to synthesize the VH and VL expressed                   germ-line nucleotide chains of the human antibody to the group B                meningococcal polysaccharide and attach them to human C 4 or C 1                and CL constant regions and evaluate the protective and other                   properties of this synthetic human antibody as a therapeutic                    agent since no effective group B vaccine is available.                                                                                                          Further structural studies on the antibody and lectin                           specificities of large fragments of Smith and Carlson degrades                  blood group A,B,H substances, and on comparisons of the                         repertoire of anti-blood group A,B,and H substances in humans and               mice will be carried out.",
