 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of General Science at               Oregon State University to purchase nine microcomputers and                     essential peripheral equipment for developing and implementing                  new, inquiry-based investigations for use in a large, non-majors                biology course.  Over 2,000 students will use the computers each                academic year.  Using computers to simulate experiments has                     several advantages over traditional laboratory exercises:                       experiments can be designed, conducted, and interpreted in less                 time; complex research problems can be brought into the                         classroom; opportunities for students to participate as                         \"scientists\" are enhanced; and many limitations related to space,               equipment, and finances can be overcome.  The Department has                    already created two new, highly successful programs that have                   allowed students to design and conduct experiments and manipulate               variables. Additional new programs will be developed.  At                       present, only one computer is linked to four monitors.  This                    requires the entire class to work in a lockstep process:                        consequently, independence and opportunities for student                        creativity are severely restricted.  The grantee is matching the                award from non-Federal sources.",
