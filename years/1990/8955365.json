 "awd_abstract_narration": "National surveys of college and university                                 undergraduates indicated that student interest in majoring in                   scientific fields and in pursuing careers in science is at or                   near its all-time low (Astin et al, 1989; Green, 1989).                         Despite these declines, a number of earlier studies suggest                     that undergraduate institutions and programs may differ                         substantially in their capacity to develop students'                            scientific interests and talents.  The principal purpose of                     the study described in this proposal is to examine a wide                       range of factors in the college environment that may affect                     students' interest in science, choice of a scientific career,                   and level of mathematical-quantitative competence.                                   The study represents a major elaboration and expansion                     of a national study of the outcomes of general education                        programs funded recently by a $366,800 grant from the Exxon                     Educational Foundation to the Higher Education Research                         Institute at UCLA.  The Exxon project involves a four-year                      longitudinal follow-up of the 1985 entering freshmen classes                    at a sample of 53 colleges and universities and a Fall 1989                     survey of all faculty of these same institutions.  The                          proposed expansion would add 100 institutions to the Exxon                      sample in order to achieve greater representativeness, to                       increase the reliability of results using the institution as                    the unit of analysis, and to generate larger samples of                         minorities, students in scientific subfields, highly able                       students, and other subpopulations of interest.                                      Various multivariate techniques will be used in applying                   an \"input-environment-output\" model to the analyses of how                      various environmental variables affect the students' interest                   in science majors and careers, retention, attitudes toward                      science, aspirations for graduate study and mathematical-                       quantitative competence.  In addition to institutional                          characteristics, the independent variables will include                         measures of curricular characteristics, peer climate, student                   involvement, faculty climate (teaching techniques, commitment                   to undergraduate education, involvement in research etc.),                      and student-faculty interaction.",
