 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues will continue                their investigations directed at understanding the physical                     processes involved in the formation, structural characteristics,                and intensity of tropical cyclones.  In particular, Dr. Gray will               attempt to answer the question why some tropical disturbances                   develop into tropical cyclones, or hurricanes, while others do                  not and the role of the environmental flow in that process.  Much               of the research involves the use of composite data sets developed               by Dr. Gray and associates over the last several decades as well                as data from an upcoming field experiment, the Tropical Cyclone                 Motion Experiment, sponsored by the Office of Naval Research.  In               addition, Dr. Gray plans to collaborate with colleagues at                      Colorado State University on a numerical modeling project to test               some of his hypotheses on the role of low level wind surges in                  the development of tropical cyclones.                                                This research is important, not only for improving our basic               understanding of a key feature of the atmosphere, but also as a                 contribution to improving prediction of these potentially very                  destructive storms.",
