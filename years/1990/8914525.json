 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in physical                      oceanography between Dr. Silvia Garzoli, Lamont-Doherty Geological              Observatory of Columbia University and Dr. Christine Provost,                   Laboratory of Oceanography and Climate, University of Pierre and                Marie Curie, Paris, France.  The objective of the project is to                 analyze data from an international high resolution study of the                 confluence zones of the Brazil and Malvinas currents.                                                                                                           A large international effort by the US, France and Argentina to                 study the dynamics of the Southwestern Atlantic will be completed               by early 1990.  The program consists of intensive field work based              primarily on the deployment of a large array of instruments                     (inverted echo sounders and current meter moorings) for a period                of 18 months, the collection of infrared satellite images for a                 period of two years, and the realization of three hydro-                        graphic/nutrients extensive surveys.  The study will result in a                jointly-collected, valuable and extensive set of oceanographic data             available for calibration, reduction, and analysis.  This award will            provide funds for Dr. Garzoli to visit France for the purpose of                establishing standards for common data calibration.  This will                  facilitate the joint data analysis and consequent joint scientific              interpretation of the whole system of circulation and thermohaline              variability in the Southwestern Atlantic.",
