 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Turgay Uzer is supported by a grant from The                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 studies of energy transfer processes in isolated molecules and                  on surfaces.  This research is important in helping chemists to                 understand the physical processes involved in laser                             photodissociation, and laser photodesorption from surfaces.                                                                                                     Uzer's theoretical and computational work concerns the                          fundamentals of intramolecular energy flow, the dynamics and                    quantization of nonseparable oscillator systems, modeling of                    intramolecular dynamics and unimolecular reactions, and                         microscopic dynamics at the surface-adsorbate interface.  Uzer                  has developed a novel \"asymmetric top mapping\" procedure which                  he will use to investigate the mechanism of localization and to                 infer the structure and systematics of quantum states near                      intramolecular bottlenecks.  He will apply this type of                         analysis to the study of the photodissociation of hydrogen                      peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides.  The dynamics and                            feasibility of molecule specific photodesorption will be                        investigated for hydrogen on aluminum oxide.  Finally, he will                  also investigate the microscopic mechanisms by which coverage                   influences adsorbate relaxation on surfaces.",
