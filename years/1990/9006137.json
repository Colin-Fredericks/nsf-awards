 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental goal of this research is the development of the                 science base necessary to reduce the time and effort required to                assemble and use computer tools for simulation and analysis of                  physical systems.  Most existing simulators solve a limited range of            problems, are difficult to modify, and are difficult to integrate               because each uses its own representation scheme.  The research will             address these issues and build an environment that automates many of            the steps in creating a simulator.                                              Defining a simulator requires; choosing equations to model the                  behavior of the physical systems, choosing and implementing                     computational methods for solving the equations defining mechanisms             to handle the complex control flow of simulations, and choosing                 representation schemes for physical objects, their properties,                  equations, etc.                                                                 Currently, these steps are carried out implicitly, without computer             aid.  The researchers will design a software architecture that                  allows simulators to be described in terms of equations and                     mathematical properties naturally suited to the problem.  The                   research will develop: a model representation system for                        representing the quantities and laws that describe the physical                 behavior in a given analysis model; and analysis specification                  system, a language for defining the behavior of a simulation in                 terms of the laws and quantities; a scene editor; and a low level               interface for integrating existing modules such a numerical packages            or finite element codes.",
