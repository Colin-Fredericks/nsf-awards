 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on econometrics                   and mathematical economics to be held in Rio de Janeiro,                        Brazil from July 16-20, 1990.  The U.S. organizer is Arnold                     Zellner of the University of Chicago and his Brazilian                          counterpart is Ruben Klein of the National Laboratory for                       Scientific Computing in Rio.  The participants will consist                     of statisticians and econometricians from the U.S., Brazil                      and other countries.  Thirteen will attend from the U.S.                        while nine or more will come from Brazil, three from Mexico                     and one from Venezuela.  This workshop will be held just                        before the annual meeting of the Brazilian National Symposium                   on Probability and Statistics and some of the attendees at that                 meeting are expected to participate in the workshop.                                                                                                            The main topic of the workshop will be Bayesian inference and                   decision analysis techniques.  Research papers will be                          presented, affording the participants an excellent opportunity                  to learn about current applied and theoretical research in                      such topics as: Bayesian decision theory and applications,                      time series analysis, spatial statistics, learning models                       and model selection techniques, computer programs and                           comparisons of Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches.                            Applications to be covered include analysis of spatial and                      time series data, forecasting problems, financial economic                      analysis and firm decision problems.  Some research contacts                    have already been established among North, Central and South                    American Bayesian researchers.  This workshop will strengthen                   these contacts and promote further joint research in this                       timely area.",
