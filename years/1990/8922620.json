 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of long time-series studies for examining temporal               variation in marine communities is widely accepted. Although                    seasonal sampling and measurements have shed much light on the                  temporal variability of biological processes in the deep sea, it                has been difficult to understand many aspects of the functioning                of these communities without a \"continuous\" record of certain                   biologically significant processes over longer time periods. This               project will conduct a long time-series monitoring program                      (>2yrs) of a benthic boundary layer community using time-lapse                  photography to monitor sea floor processes and particulate flux                 measurements as an estimate of food supply entering the benthic                 boundary layer. Such monitoring will provide a temporal framework               for more intensive seasonal measurements of benthic processes at                a single deep bottom station in the California Current upwelling                system where strong seasonality in primary production at the                    surface and in particulate organic matter (POM) flux at deep                    bottom depths is well established.  Dr. Smith will address two                  major questions: 1) Is there a temporal relationship (that is a                 coupling) between the flux of particulate organic matter (POM)                  entering the benthic boundary layer (BBL) and the arrival and                   residence of detritus at the sediment water interface? 2) Is                    there a temporal relationship between the distribution,                         abundance, movements, and nutritional state of large bottom                     dwelling organisms and the flux of POM entering the BBL and/or                  the arrival and residence of detritus at the sediment-water                     interface? This study will improve our understanding of the                     functioning of deep-sea benthic boundary layer communities and                  their importance in biogeochemical cycling over interannual time                scales.",
