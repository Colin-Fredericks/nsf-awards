It is a cooperative venture among 3 Florida                     Universities designed to recruit undergraduate students to engage               in research projects at these institutions.  In all,                            12 students, including a large percentage of women and                          minorities, will be selected to work with 3 principal                           investigators from the University of Central Florida, the                       University of South Florida and Stetson University.  The focus of               the research will be on computer vision.  After a general                       introduction to material on computer vision, students will be                   asked to select an individual research project from those                       proposed by the faculty.  Specific areas of research include                    dynamic scene analysis, recognition systems, and motion                         trajectories.",
