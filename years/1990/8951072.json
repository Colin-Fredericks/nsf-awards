 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to enhance the training in molecular                  biology provided for undergraduates in the Department of                        Biological Sciences at the University of Denver.  The Department                has developed a junior/senior laboratory course that will afford                students both theoretical and practical \"hands-on\" experience                   with many of the important genetic engineering techniques                       currently employed in biotechnology.  The focus is on                           laboratories which introduce the following techniques:                          preparation and fractionation of DNA, in vitro labeling and                     manipulation of genomic libraries.  The uniqueness of the course                is that it will allow students to isolate and study a previously                unidentified gene from a free-living nematode.  Instrumentation                 for the course includes centrifugation equipment, a                             spectrophotometer, and the electrophoresis and blotting units                   necessary for nucleic acid separation and identification.  Most                 equipment will be used in several different laboratory exercises,               reflecting the integrated and research-oriented nature of the                   course.  The laboratory should materially improve the preparation               of undergraduates for work in all phases of molecular biology and               clearly extend their ability to design research projects and                    carry them out.  The laboratory will also result in a published                 set of laboratory sequences that could be used at other                         universities.  The grantee is match the award with non-Federal                  sources.",
