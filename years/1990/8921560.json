 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Andrew F.                            Seybert, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University                       of Kentucky, and Dr. Benjamin Soenarko, Engineering Physics                     Department, Bandung Institute of Technology, Indonesia, to                      pursue, for a period of 24 months, cooperative research on                      boundary element methods (BEM) in acoustics (also known as                      integral equation methods).  The PI's will utilize BEM to                       formulate and solve several types of multi-domain and                           thin-body problems in acoustics.  For the multi-domain                          problem, the acoustic domain of interest is interior to a                       closed surface of arbitrary shape, exterior to a closed                         body, or coupled to another domain.  For the thin-body                          problem, the acoustic domain is exterior to a body whose                        smallest dimension is of the same order or less than some                       numerical parameter such as element length.  By using BEM,                      three dimensional problems are solved on the two                                dimensional boundary of the domain, thus, simplifying                           computations.  The collaborators also will attempt to                           determine how to utilize special matrix techniques to                           increase the computational speed of the BEM.                                                                                                                    The development of methods for the solution of multi-domain                     and thin-body acoustic problems will be beneficial to a                         wide range of specific engineering problems.  These include                     the prediction of sound pressure and power radiated by                          industrial products such as engines, pumps, and compressors                     when partially shrouded by an enclosure for noise control;                      design of quiet interiors of vehicles and aircraft;                             understanding how multiple sources may be used in active                        vibration/active noise control; and the design and                              optimization of complex networks of acoustic passageways                        such as those that occur in the interior of mufflers,                           induction systems of engines, and silencers for fans.  The                      researchers are highly respected engineers who have                             successfully collaborated in the past.  Dr. Soenarko is a                       skilled experimentalist who has worked closely with the                         aircraft industry and understands the practical nature of                       the research.  Dr. Seybert's team will have the benefit of                      Dr. Soenarko's experience in experimental methods and                           validation.  This project adds an international cooperative                     dimension to ongoing research under NSF Grant No.                               MSM-8810909.   This project is relevant to the objectives                       of the Science in Developing Countries Program which seeks                      to increase the level of cooperation between U.S.                               scientists and engineers and their counterparts in                              developing countries through the exchange of scientific                         information, ideas, skills, and techniques and through                          collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
