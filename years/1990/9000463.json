 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium will operate the                   research vessel PELICAN, a 105' general oceanographic vessel                    constructed in 1985 and the R/V ACADIANA, a 57' research vessel                 constructed in 1986. Both ships will operate in the Mississippi                 River and delta region.  The R/V PELICAN will also operate in the               Gulf of Mexico.                                                                                                                                                 These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science                  Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.",
