 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complex analytical problems of separating the                               intermediates and products from the oxidation of fuel-like                      hydrocarbons require sophisticated chromatographic techniques.                  Two complementary methodologies to provide these capabilities                   are capillary columns and computer controlled, programmed                       valve switching, also called multi-dimensional or \"heart                        cutting\" analysis.  While capillary columns by themselves                       provide increased resolution over packed columns, they have                     not been sufficient to separate very complicated mixtures of                    alkanes, olefins, and oxygenates.  Therefore to achieve                         separation, it is often necessary to use multiple columns                       which are switched into and out of the carrier flow during an                   analysis.  Further separation is often achieved by holding                      selected fractions of the gas sample in a column and                            backflushing this partial sample into a second analytical                       column.  This technique is called \"multi-dimensional\" gas                       chromatography.  The system specified will allow                                implementation of sophisticated separation techniques, which                    are required for several ongoing research projects of the                       Combustion and Fuels Research Group.                                                                                                                            An enhanced gas chromatography identification/analysis system                   is requested to replace and upgrade existing capabilities for                   conducting research in the combustion processes and engine and                  fuels technology areas.  The proposed system allows multi-                      dimensional analysis capabilities, which are essential in the                   analysis of more fuel-like hydrocarbons which have carbon                       numbers greater than or equal to five.",
