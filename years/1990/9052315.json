 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment is being purchased to integrate concepts of                           environmental sciences throughout the curriculum and develop                    students' analytical skills.  Beginning and advanced students                   conduct experiments that integrate field and laboratory                         experiences.  They measure responses of plants and animals to                   their environment and manipulate variables to test hypotheses.                  Students use a light sensor, leaf area/image analyzer, balances,                portable water quality lab, and portable hygrometer/thermometer                 to measure important environmental parameters.  Environmental                   chambers and a refrigerated incubator allow students to control                 temperature, light, and humidity to learn how environmental                     conditions affect essential physiological and ecological                        processes.  Approximately 200 students per year benefit during                  lab experiences in the first two biology courses.  Another 50-60                majors use the equipment in upper level courses, and will have                  the opportunity to use the modern equipment for independent                     research in environmental science.  The university will                         contribute an amount equal to the award.",
