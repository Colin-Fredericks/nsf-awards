 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continued destruction of the coastal and tropical forest               in South and Central America threatens the survival of natural                  animal populations, including the callitrichid primates (tamarins               and marmosets).  While the golden lion tamarins are considered an               endangered species, through a highly successful breeding program                at the University of Nebraska under the auspices of the National                Zoological Park, these primates are being bred in captivity and a               small group of six have recently been reintroduced into forests                 of Brazil.  Their survival as a species, however, depends                       extensively on understanding how their reproduction is                          synchronized to lead to a greater likelihood of fertilization.                                                                                                       Dr. French will investigate the complex interplay between                  internal physiological factors and external social and                          environmental factors in gold lion tamarins.  Unlike Old World                  primates and apes, the callitrichid primates are monogamous and                 thus, develop a close and long-lasting association, or pair-                    bond, between a breeding male and female.  Dr. French will use                  noninvasive data collection techniques for both hormone samples                 and behavioral measurements to compare the degree to which social               factors influence hormonal regulation of reproduction.  His                     findings will be compared with the results obtained in similarly                conducted studies in which Old World non-monogamous primate                     species have been used.  This work will contribute to our                       understanding of the role of hormonal and social influences on                  reproductive behavior in golden lion tamarins as well as other                  New World primates of which many are considered threatened or                   endangered species.  Furthermore, the results will significantly                enhance the captive breeding programs of endangered species and                 thus, contribute to the preservation of these small South                       American primates.",
