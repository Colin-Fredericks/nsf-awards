 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study pictorial priming by                         using a task previously investigated and published by him.                      In general, the subject under study will be offered primes                      in a series of whole pictures and they will be tested using                     a series of degraded pictures as target items.  The subject                     will receive three identical primes, three similar primes                       and three pictures that have not been presented during the                      priming portion of the task.  Male and female subjects and                      the picture feature types contour will be used in the study.                    The pictures a subject receives during the target series                        will be either identical in spatial orientation to the                          prime offered in the first portion of the task or will be a                     mirror-image in terms of spatial orientation.  The subjects                     performance will be recorded in terms of time to solve the                      degraded form and the number of keystrokes to solve the                         degraded form.  The investigator hopes to determine if                          performance is affected by the slowing of the visual system                     that might occur with aging.",
