 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactions between the immune and endocrine systems were first                postulated nearly a century ago.  Investigations of the interactions            between these two important biological systems were sporadic over the           next nine decades; however, within the last few years, scientist have           begun to realize the importance of these two systems, and their                 interactions, in maintaining normal body functions and combating                disease states.  Dr. Kasson has recently identified a new protein               produced by white blood cells of the immune system which communicates           important stimulatory information to the reproduction endocrine                 system.  He thinks that this protein may represent an important factor          in immune-endocrine communication and have proposed studies to                  investigate the nature and functions of this protein.  Initially he             will define the nature and structure of the protein and identify any            similarities between this protein and other known proteins.  Latter             studies will investigate how this protein interacts with cells of the           reproductive system and how it elicits responses in reproductive cells.         These studies will provide new information on how the immune endocrine          systems communicate and may uncover new insights into how defects in            these pathways produce disease states.  A better understanding of the           interactions between these two important biological regulatory systems          may lead to new therapies to treat disease states involving deficits            in immune-endocrine regulation (i.e. autoimmune diseases, diabetes,             hyperthyroidism, infertility, etc.)",
