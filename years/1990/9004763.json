 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to identify factors involved in            blue-light induced transcription of proteins in higher plants.  There           are two basic classes of transcription factors, core factors and                regulatory factors.  Core factors allow for low level, constitutive             expression.  Their presence or activity is not regulated and they               function for many genes.  Regulatory factors are not always active and          affect the rate of Pisum sativum (pea) and Arabidopsis thaliani to              identify the regulatory factors that effect blue-light transcription of         a pigment-binding protein found in plants.                                                                                                                      Blue light represents a regulatory signal for many events in growth and         development.  Examples of these events are found in all the kingdoms            and range from bacterial motion to alleviation of winter depression in          humans.  The basic biochemical mechanism by which blue light is                 perceived and transduced into a signal useful for the cell is probably          very ancient.  Indeed, as light represents one of the oldest                    environmental cues, it may be that blue-light regulation is the oldest          signal.  Understanding this ancient mechanism will provide insight into         how cells interpret many extracellular signals.",
