 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a protocol for the              cryopreservation of Drosophila melanogaster embryos.  In our                    studies to date, we have taken a mechanistic approach in                        investigating three strategies of cryopreservation; supercooling,               conventional cryopreservation, and vitrification.  Of the three,                only vitrification is appropriate because it allows for ultra-rapid             cooling rates to minimize injury associated with the extreme                    subzero chilling sensitivity of the embryos.  With this approach,               we have attained 20.0 \u001a 10.3% hatching of eggs following recovery               from liquid nitrogen.  More important, in recent studies 3% of the              surviving larvae developed into fertile adults.  For this proposal,             studies will first focus on modifications of the culture conditions             to increase the number of larvae that develop into adults by                    minimizing larval desiccation, adding ecdysteroids that control                 sclerotization and pupariation, varying temperature, and modifying              the culture medium.  A systematic analysis will then be conducted               on the effects of each step of the vitrification procedure on                   larval development, pupariation, and adult eclosion, including                  cryoprotectants used for loading, loading time, dehydration time,               different vitrification solutions, and cryogenic treatment.  The                results of this analysis will be used to optimize the vitrification             procedure with respect to larval development, pupariation, and                  adult eclosion following recovery from liquid nitrogen.  For this               work, a multidisciplinary team of cryobiologists, a biophysicist,               an engineer, and a Drosophila geneticist has been assembled.                                                                                                    A successful increase in the number of fertile adults produced by               this cryopreservation technique will significantly reduce the costs             of maintaining Drosophila stocks.  Drosophila now have to be                    maintained as living cultures in order to keep the myriads of                   genetic types available.",
