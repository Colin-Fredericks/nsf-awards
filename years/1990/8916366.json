 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a multienzyme complex, formed in T4 phage-               infected Escherichia coli, which carries out the synthesis of                   deoxyribonucleoside tripgisohates (dNTPs).  This T4 dNTP                        synthesis complex will be investigated by both biochemical and                  genetic means, with the goals of learning how it functions and                  how it integrates dNTP synthesis with DNA replication.                          First, through analysis of complexes isolated from T4-infected                  cells and through partial reconstitution of the complex from                    purified proteins, we hope to define the protein composition,                   stoichiometry, and protein-protein interactions within the                      complex.                                                                        Second, through assays for multi-step reaction pathways                         catalayzed by the purified complex, and through study of the                    allosteric properties of its constituent enzymes, we hope to                    learn how regulation of individual enzymes contributes toward                   control of the complex, and in turn helps to explain how dNTP                   synthesis is controlled in vitro.                                               Third, through enzyme kinetic analysis, studies with bifunctional               protein crosslinkers, and investigations of dNTP pool dynamics                  and DNA synthesis in vitro, we hope to learn whether the dNTP                   synthetase complex is physically or functionally linked to the                  DNA replication apparatus in vivo.                                              Fourth, through reversion analysis at defined loci in the T4 rII                cistrons, we will investigate mechanisms of mutagenesis induced                 by DNA precursor pool imbalances, with some of the data possibly                generating insight into the nature of the microenvironment at DNA               replication sites.",
