 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is a truism that science changes our view of our place in                    the universe.  The rise of modern science which came with the                   Copernican Revolution of the 16th century moved the earth and                   mankind from the center to the periphery of creation.  The                      Darwinian Revolution of the 19th century made mankind itself                    just one more of the animals which evolved from the primordial                  ooze.  The quantum revolution of this century called into                       doubt our most trusted theories of causation.  The project                      that Professor Roe is undertaking aims to examine another                       scientific theory, one which has hardly been studied at all,                    but which, she argues, radically altered man's view of God and                  the State in the 18th century.  Her study focuses on the role                   biological ideas played in the mid 18th century, when                           traditional concepts of nature, morality, and society were                      being challenged.  During the High Enlightenment (1750s to                      1770s) the notion of a divinely ordered, unchanging, and                        hierarchical universe (including both the natural and social                    worlds) clashed with a new view of nature and society without                   God, in which processes of change and development replaced                      those of stable harmony.  Biological ideas, especially on the                   generation of life, were taken up into this controversy and                     in turn were charged with new significance by it.  Professor                    Roe's study focuses on a number of individuals (Buffon,                         Needham, Bonnet, Haller, Voltaire, Helvetius, Diderot,                          d'Holbach, and other contemporaries), and recreates the                         intellectual and political world of mid-century Paris and                       Geneva.  She aims for a contextual history that demonstrates                    how the biological controversy arose within these intellectual                  and social crises and why materialist views of nature seemed                    so threatening to some and so provocative to others.",
