 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in physical                            oceanography to be conducted by Bjorn Kjerfve of the University                 of South Carolina in collaboration with Bastiaan Knoppers of                    the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Niteroi, Brazil.  The                    work will consist of the measurement of the dynamic                             characteristics of the largest coastal lagoon along the                         Fluminense coastline.  It is vital to establish a base line                     for lagoon dynamics before planned intense development                          begins.  This lagoon is hypersaline, being choked off from                      the ocean (unlike estuaries where there is a mixing zone).                      Characteristics to be measured include salinity structure,                      sedimentation rates (runoff), wind effects, nutrient                            concentration, temperatures and evaporation rates and tidal                     dynamics.  These data will be compared to those taken in                        other fresh and brackish water lagoons in which previous                        oceanographic and ecological studies have been carried out.                                                                                                     There are coastal lagoons around the world, notably in New                      England and the Gulf coast of the U.S. Not all of them are in                   arid climates but climatic variability affects hydrological                     and ecological processes and the study of this hypersaline                      example will extend the range of such effects.  It will also                    add to the extensive biological, chemical, geological and                       geographical work in progress as well as investigations in                      health, sociology and economics studies underway on these                       lagoons.  Modelling and the use of this data will help                          develop predictive capability for linear and nonlinear                          processes in lagoon systems.  Kjerfve's experience in                           hydrology and ecology will complement those of the Brazilian                    multidisciplinary team and in particular the biogeochemical                     work of Knoppers. Students will participate in the work in                      Brazil and some will follow this field work with Ph.D.                          studies in the U.S.",
