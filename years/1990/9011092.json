 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal hopes to accomplish two major goals:  The                         first is to identify the relationship between chronic                           violence at the subsocietal level and variations in                             children's social/developmental well-being.  The second                         goal is to identify a subset of \"invulnerable\" or                               \"resilient\" children, i.e., those who experience the same                       difficulties as their peers, but who somehow weather the                        storm.  These resilient children will be investigated in a                      prospective way to determine what factors in their lives                        seem to protect them against succumbing to the maladaptive                      effects of violence on their development.  This study will                      use across-sectional design to address its specific aims.                       Children (4th-6th grade) from school districts with high and                    low incidence of homocide will be selected.  Children will                      complete measures of their perceptions of environmental                         violence and social support.  Their parents and teachers                        will provide ratings of their social and emotional                              behavior.",
