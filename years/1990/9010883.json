The project will evaluate this hypothesis by                      comparing the early semantic categorization of topological                      spatial actions (e.g., PUT IN/ON) by children learning English,                 Korean, and Dutch.  These languages classify spatial actions in                 strikingly different ways for purposes of linguistic expression.                However, to the extent that children rely on nonlinguistic                      concepts rather than analysis of the linguistic input for the                   meanings of words, their spatial semantic categories should be                  similar, or at least should not differ systematically according                 to language.  Two cross-sectional studies will be carried out                   with 80 children in each language (age range 1;0-3;6).  In the                  production experiment, children are encouraged to tell the                      experimenter how to spatially arrange objects.  The comprehension               study assesses sensitivity to language-specific semantic                        distinctions with the \"preferential looking paradigm\".  The data                will be analyzed (1) to determine how early children learning                   each language develop language-specific principles of                           categorizing spatial actions, and (2) to aassess, through                       analysis of correct and incorrect patterns of generalizations,                  the relative difficulty for children of alternative principles of               spatial classification.  Our conclusions should enable us to                    characterize more precisely than is now possible the nature of                  the interaction in early language acquisition between                           nonlinguistic categorization predispositions and children's                     sensitivity to the semantic categories of the input language.",
