 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compared with a standard photographic/optical tachistoscope, a                  video tachistoscope would have more flexibility in image                        creation, storage, and presentation.  However, standard video                   frame rates do not give sufficient temporal resolution in                       experimental displays.  Dr. Thomas will build and test a video                  tachistoscope capable of 500 frames per second, 512 x 512 pixels                per frame, and 8-bits per pixel.  At 500 frames per second, the                 temporal resolution is one frame interval or 2 milliseconds which               is necessary for perceptual experiments using tachistoscopic                    presentations in the study of spatiotemporal response                           characteristics or motion.  The fast display system will consist                of a specially designed monitor with P167 phosphor, a controller                with image memory, and an interface to a microcomputer.  The                    controller memory module will store from 1 to 1238 images which                 could be generated by the computer or selected from a library of                stimulus images.  The display sequence will be programmable so                  that each of the stored images can be displayed for a specified                 number of video frames.  In Phase I, Dr. Thomas will build the                  first instrument and test its electronic and optical                            characteristics.  In Phase II, he plans to conduct experiments                  using both the currently-standard tachistoscope and the new                     instrument, then proceed to use the video tachistoscope in                      various experiments in visual perception and aging, as well as                  develop software for efficient use of the highly flexible and                   powerful instrument.  After the first unit, the new instrument                  should be relatively inexpensive and affordable by many research                labs, academic departments, and vision testing labs.",
