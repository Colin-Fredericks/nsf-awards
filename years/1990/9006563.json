Preliminary findings of NSF (1987-1990) supported research                      on Kentucky State administrators has suggested that state                       government sponsored management training programs                               constitute an important correlate of the professional                           development of the state administrators in Kentucky.                            Considering the diverse program variations in the                               management training programs sponsored by various state                         governments, these preliminary findings on a single-state                       study suggest the need for a comprehensive national                             study.  A theorical model was proposed in the earlier                           study which has been refined in this proposed national                          study.                                                                                                                                                          A new construct \"state administrative culture\" has been                         posited in the proposed model.  The proposed fifty state                        study will focus on the relationships between public                            service education/state agency sponsored management                             training programs and the orientations of a representative                      sample of 25,000 state managers in the fifty states toward                      public service professionalism.  The methodology of data                        collection will be mail surveys aiming at 50% response                          rate generating about 12,500 valid questionnaires for data                      analyses.  Four specific hypotheses will be tested about                        the relationships between the orientations toward public                        service professionalism and public service                                      education/management training.                                                                                                                                  The proposed project will involve Kentucky State                                University graduate students, faculty, and professional                         staff of the Governmental Services Center.                                      Consultants from the Council of State Governments, and                          research faculty from the universities of Kentucky and                          Louisville will assist the research team.                                                                                                                       One of the goals of the project is to strengthen the                            social science research capability of Kentucky State                            University, an historically black higher education                              institution.  This will be the first national level                             empirical study of the professional socialization of                            state administrators with a comprehensive sample.                               It is anticipated that the findings of this study will                          generate new knowledge about the role of management                             training programs as agents of professional                                     socialization of state public administrators.",
