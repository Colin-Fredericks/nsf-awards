 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of his advisors Drs. Kathleen Deagan and                    Elizabeth Wing, Mr. James Cusick will analyze material from the                 archaeological site of St. Augustine.  The resulting data will                  provide the basis for his doctoral dissertation.  St. Augustine,                located in Florida, is one of the oldest European settlements in                the New World.  It was founded by the Spanish but also occupied                 by Minorcans as well as other ethnic groups.  Because of its age                and cultural complexity, the site has been extensively excavated.               Its importance rests not only on the amount of archaeological                   material which has been recovered but also on the detailed                      archival records which contain information on individual                        families.  Mr. Cusick will focus his attention on a sample of                   nine households of both Spanish and of Minorcan origin.  Not only               is archival information available for all but the living sites of               each have been carefully excavated.  Mr. Cusick will integrate                  the documentary evidence with information derived from analysis                 of material objects, floral, and faunal remains.  He will examine               how the economic and social strategies of these families changed                over time and how these shifts are related to ethnic, economic,                 and status factors.                                                                                                                                             The goal of this project is to examine the role which ethnicity                 plays in shaping household adaptation strategies.  Minorcans were               a minority group in St. Augustine, and with joint archaeological                and archival data it will be possible to determine how such                     groups reacted, in comparison with the dominant Spanish majority,               to changing economic and political conditions.  One major                       theoretical question debated in the sociological literature                     concerns the extent to which response follows ethnic lines.  Some               argue it is more closely correlated with cross cutting economic                 distinctions.                                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons.  First, it                      provides a unique insight into mechanisms for ethnic adaptation                 and assimilation and, thus, is directly relevant to social issues               faced by the United States today.  Secondly, it will assist in                  the training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
