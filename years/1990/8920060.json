 "awd_abstract_narration": "I recommend that this proposal be funded as a SGER award at                                                                                                $50,000 for a one-year period.  A starting date of 11/01/89 is                  desirable.  Dr. Reed originally submitted this proposal (much                   too early) for the December 1 deadline date for the NCR program.                                                                                                He claims to have a critical need for funding before we could                   possibly make an award in that review cycle.  It seemed to me                   that this proposal was an excellent candidate for a SGER award,                 and Dr. Reed said he wanted to apply for it.  The proposal                      qualifies for the SGER under two of the award conditions:  (1)                  preliminary work on novel and untested ideas.  (2) application of                                                                                               new expertise and new approaches to \"old research topics.  If the                                                                                               work is successful, it could have an enormous impact upon                       subsequent research and development in coding theory and design                 of communication systems.  This is because algebraic decoding                   techniques, in contrast to search techniques, are typically                     capable of implementation with appreciably lower circuit                        complexity.  This allows the use of longer, more effective codes                                                                                                in communication systems within the constraints of                                                                                                              receiver/decoder costs.  Dr. Reed's preliminary results yielded                                                                                                 the first algebraic decoder for a certain Golay code, and further                                                                                               results could do the same for the entire class of quadratic                                                                                                     residue codes, and possibly other classes of codes.  Dr. Reed has                                                                                               an outstanding reputation as an innovative researcher.  He is the                                                                                               developer of the famous Reed-Solomon codes which are extensively                                                                                                used in communication and recording systems.",
