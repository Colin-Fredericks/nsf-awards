 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six problems are posed about hyperplane arrangements A                     defined by a product Q of linear forms in a vector space V.  (1)                The polynomial map Q has a non-isolated singularity at the                      origin.  Let F be its Milnor fiber.  Compute the cohomology of F                for a generic arrangement.  (2)  It has been conjectured that if                A is free, then the restriction of A to a subspace in its lattice               is again free.  Investigate this conjecture for Coxeter                         arrangements.  (3)  Known results on Hessians and discriminants                 of Shephard groups will be combined with ideas of Saito to give a               case-free proof of the existence of flat basic invariants for                   Shephard groups, and to explain why the complements of their                    reflection arrangements are K(G,1)-spaces.  (4)  Let S be the                   algebra of polynomial functions on V and let J be the Jacobian                  ideal generated by the partial derivatives of Q.  If A is                       generic, then the homological dimension of S/J is equal to dimV.                Study the homological dimension of S/J for all arrangements.  (5)               Given H in A let B denote the restriction of A to H.  There is a                natural restriction of the derivations tangent to A to the                      derivations tangent to B.  This map is surjective in some cases                 and not surjective in others.  Find precise conditions for                      surjectivity.  (6)  Subspace arrangements will be studied with                  respect to the question of additivity of the Poincare polynomial                under deletion and restriction.  The use of computers, to furnish               experimental material, is implicit in the work.                                      These six problems show that in high dimensions the ways in                which a finite number of linear spaces can be imbedded in a                     linear space of one greater dimension exhibits a surprisingly                   rich structure.  Standard tools of topology are well adapted to                 elucidating this structure and will be further exploited.",
