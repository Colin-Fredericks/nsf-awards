 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of coating is of very high economic importance to                 this country and the need to increase the scientific knowledge base             through research in this field is well known.  Although coatings                technology is evolving from an art to a science, much of today's                coatings development is still done by empirical methods.  The                   coating technologist relies less on firmly based scientific                     principles and more on his/her own judgement and/or data base of                information of actual performance of coatings in the field.  The                data base may be large and sophisticated, but it is empirical.                  Empirical methods have yielded slow, steady progress but                        breakthroughs and innovations have been rare.  Given the                        competitiveness of the world market, and the pressures to find                  pollution free coatings, a center directed toward scientific                    studies of coating is highly desirable.  The establishment of a                 Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for                    Coatings Research is an ideal part of the solution of the problem.              Eastern Michigan University proposes to form an I/UCRC for Coatings             Research to attack the limits of coating technology.                                 This award initiates an I/UCRC on Coatings Research at Eastern             Michigan University.  The initial research will focus in the areas              of VOC reduction, corrosion protection, cross-linking, film                     mechanical properties and water-borne coatings.  The Coatings                   Research Center has excellent research instrumentation and                      facilities, provided by grants from the State of Michigan of almost             $1,000,000.                                                                          Eight companies and the State of Michigan have agreed to                   provide $30,000 per year to support this research.                                   The Program Manager recommends that Eastern Michigan be                    awarded $50,000 per year for a five year continuing grant.                           Near the end of each 12 month period the program manager                   and/or the Director of the Engineering Centers Division will review             the progress of the center on a number of criteria, including the               following:  (1) the extent to which the university-industry                     interaction and collaboration is developing; (2)  The extent to                 which the support base is expanding; (3) the extent to which a                  robust research program is developing.  If the review is                        satisfactory, the program manager will recommend support of the                 next period of this continuing grant.",
