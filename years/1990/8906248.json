 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research concerns the development and analysis of                      algorithms for computing the stationary probabilities of large                  scale Markov chains on modern multiprocessor computers. The                     computation of stationary probabilities for large scale problems                is a fundamental concern in a wide variety of applications such                 as computer modeling, computer performance evaluation, queueing                 networks, and more generally, in applications where discrete                    mathematical models are used to understand the dynamics of very                 large systems comprised of a collection of loosely coupled                      subsystems. Parallel and vector implementations on a variety of                 multiprocessor computers will be emphasized and specific                        techniques under investigation include subspace iteration                       methods; hybrid iterative-direct algorithms; overlapping block                  iterative schemes; parallel aggregation and iteration methods;                  and block elimination algorithms. The architectural aspect of the               work involves the identification of those features of                           contemporary vector and parallel computers which are best suited                for implementing these techniques, and in this regard, a variety                of machines, including the Alliant FX/series, the Sequent                       Balance, and the CRAY Y-MP will continue to be used.",
