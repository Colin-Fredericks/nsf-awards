 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will take a two-pronged approach to give greater                 insight into how signals are perceived and transduced into responses            in plant cells.  (1) Rhizobium bacteria induce the formation of                 nitrogen fixing nodules in plants and together they provide the major           input of biologically fixed nitrogen in agriculture.  Cellular and              molecular biological methods will be brought to bear on the analysis            of early events of nodulation (nod gene mechanisms) of root hairs in            the Rhizobium meliloti-alfalfa system (with Sharon Long).  A newly              developed method will allow bacterial cells and purified \"nod factors\"          to be applied to or injected into single root hair cells.  Video-               enhanced (including confocal laser scanning) light microscopic images           will permit the in vivo observations of induced responses in                    nodulating root hair cells, and these images will be correlated with            in vitro electron microscopic images.  Transient and longer response            changes in internal calcium ion levels, cytoskeletal elements,                  calmodulin and the endoplasmic reticulum will be examined.  A clearer           understanding of the cellular, genetic and molecular aspects of                 nodulation should result.  (2) The photoreceptor phytochrome mediates           a host of light-activated developmental processes in plants.                    Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against phytochrome will be used           to detect and localize (video microscopically) the distribution of the          membrane-associated fractions of phytochrome in pea stem vesicles, and          if that is successful, in cells (with Winslow Briggs).                            Interactive activities will consist of a course entitled Gender and           Science, taught to undergraduate and graduate students from different           disciplines in the sciences and humanities; lectures in a \"Microscopy           for Biologists\" course on video-enhanced, computer-based microscopic            methods; several seminars; and organization of informal panel                   discussions on several topics pertinent to women (and men) in science.            This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
