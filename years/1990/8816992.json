 "awd_abstract_narration": "Soybean calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) is the first                    Ca2+-dependent protein kinase from plants to be purified to                     homogeneity.  This enzyme represents a new class of protein                     kinases that are dependent on micromolar calcium for activity                   but do not require phospholipids or calmodulin for activity.                    Preliminary immunocytochemical localization of the enzyme                       shows that CDPK is associated with actin filaments in soybean                   and onion root tip cells.  This association suggests that                       CDPK may play a role in the regulation of plant actin.  The                     purification and characterization of CDPK allows the study of                   both the role of calcium and protein phosphorylation in                         plants.  This research investigates these roles by (1) fully                    characterizing the calcium-binding properties of CDPK, (2)                      determining the immunological properties of CDPK, (3)                           determining how CDPK binds to actin, and (4) identifying                        actin-associated proteins that are substrates of CDPK.%%%                                                                                                       Many metabolic activities in plants and animals are regulated                   by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanisms.  Protein                       kinases play a major role in this type of regulation.                           Recently, a new class of protein kinases which directly bind                    calcium have been discovered.  The experiments defined here                     will provide for investigation of the potential role of these                   calcium-dependent protein kinases in the regulation of the                      plant cytoskeleton and to better define its role in the                         regulation of plant cell function and in plant growth and                       development.***//",
