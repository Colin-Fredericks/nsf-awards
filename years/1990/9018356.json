 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports travel for U.S. scientists to attend a                    symposium and field trip related to the Xianshuihe fault in                     Chengdu, China.  The symposium and field trip are a part of the                 Protocol for Earthquake Studies between the PRC and the USGS/NSF.               The symposium was motivated by the importance of the Xianshuihe                 fault both as a hazard and as the best analog in the world to the               most active coterminous US fault, the San Andreas.  Because slip                rates on the Xianshuihe may be up to 4 times those on the San                   Andreas, research results could be available in a much shorter                  time for fulfilling goals of the National Earthquake Hazard                     Reduction Program (NEHRP) of which NSF is a lead agency.  The                   Xianshuihe would serve as a highly desirable testing ground for                 theories developed in San Andreas studies.  One of the objectives               of the trip is to develop joint US/PRC investigations of the                    Xianshuihe under the Protocol.  This research is a component of                 the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.",
