 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iowa State University will initiate a 4-week residential                        Young Scholars project for 20 students in grades 8-9 in                         molecular biology.  This four-week enrichment program in                        molecular biology stresses both content instruction and                         science practice through laboratory experimentation utilizing                   research techniques and equipment.  Twenty 8th and 9th                          graders will spend a minimum of 20 hours a week in the                          laboratory, carrying out experiments and developing research                    skills.  Lectures covering relevant topics in chemistry,                        biochemistry, cellular and molecular biology, and                               biotechnology provide the background for the laboratory                         sessions.  Participants design, execute, and present the                        results of an independent project in a public forum.  Career                    exploration is emphasized through interactions with                             scientists, visits to industrial laboratories, and career                       planning exercises.  Participants are encouraged to continue                    independent study through a quarterly newsletter.  Research                     incentive grants are available and assistance is given in                       presenting papers at science fairs and symposia.",
