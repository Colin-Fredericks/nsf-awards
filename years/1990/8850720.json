 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations in Mathematics:  Alternatives to Traditional Assessment          will develop assessment techniques and tools that help teachers and             eighth grade students focus on students' understanding of and ability to        communicate about essential mathematical ideas in a wide range of               realistic and imaginative situations.  The Lawrence Hall of Science will        assemble a group of mathematicians, mathematics educators, and                  mathematics teachers to create a collection of tools, called                    \"investigations\", and a process for using them which integrates                 assessment and instruction.  In each investigation, students will be            required to read, understand, conceptualize, and represent a problem            situation; to use mathematical skills and knowledge to make sense of the        situation; and to communicate their thinking in a form that can be              understood and evaluated.  Investigations will give students the                opportunity to consolidate and apply their mathematical understandings          to the solution of complex problems.  Included in the package will be           teaching suggestions for the introduction of investigations, ways to            assist students as they work on investigations, sample scoring schemes,         and ideas for giving students feedback on their work.  The                      investigations will focus on the most important mathematical ideas of           the curriculum.",
