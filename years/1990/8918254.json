 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the mechanisms by                   which insects (in particular, leaf-chewing caterpillars) cope                   with the potential toxins (termed \"allelochemicals\") that occur                 naturally in their foodplants.  Insects produce certain enzymes                 that can detoxify may allelochemicals; they can also choose to                  feed on or avoid certain plants, based on taste and/or smell of                 the allelochemicals present.  But how do insects respond to                     variation in levels of nutrients and allelochemicals in their                   foodplants?  And do these responses to nutritional variation                    affect the insects' ability to detoxify or otherwise cope with                  the allelochemicals?  We know that many insect species respond to               reduced nutritional quality of their food by eating more, but we                don't know the consequences to the insects of this increased                    feeding, in terms of consuming more of a toxin.  Also, we don't                 know whether insects can balance their intake of beneficial                     nutrients and deleterious allelochemicals to achieve their best                 growth and survival under the circumstances.  Within this                       context, the proposed research addresses the interactions between               nutrients, allelochemicals, detoxication enzymes and insect                     feeding behavior.                                                                    This research will provide important basic information                     necessary for understanding the ecological and evolutionary                     aspects of insect feeding behavior.  The research will also                     concentrate on important crop pests, and thus the results will                  lead to better understanding of their feeding behavior, which in                turn will contribute to developing more effective methods to                    manage these pests.",
