 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide new insight into auditory, phonetic                  and attention requirements necessary for speech perception. The                 research will study children's unique responses to speech                       perception tasks in order to uncover basic processing abilities                 of humans and in order to test theories of speech perception.  In               the first phase of study, ten children aged five to six and ten                 adults will participate in discrimination testing, labeling, and                selective adaptation tasks.  The selective adaptation task                      typically results in a shift in the location of listeners'                      phonetic category boundary after exposure to repeated                           presentations of one stimulus (the adaptor).  The boundary change               reflects the differing contributions of peripheral auditory, more               central auditory, and linguistic/phonetic influences on speech                  perception.  These contributing factors can be addressed by                     manipulation of characteristics of the adaptor stimulus used                    during selective adaptation trials.  Because Sussman and Carney                 (1989) showed that school-aged children, in sharp contrast to                   adults, did not demonstrate a selective adaptation effect, this                 research should clarify whether results with children were due to               children's poorer discrimination ability, different choice of                   best phonetic category exemplar, or attention factors.  By                      administering different adaptor conditions to children compared                 to adults and comparing performance to measures of auditory                     discrimination, phase one will reveal the importance of acoustic,               phonetic, and attention factors for speech perception.  Results                 from the first phase of research will be expanded into a multi-                 year project including three sets of investigations.  1) Older                  children will be studied to determine if and when the                           relationship between lower-level auditory abilities and selective               adaptation becomes adult-like.  2) Adult selective adaptation                   ability will be studied with a spectral match variable to further               examine the necessity of attention factors.  3) Psychoacoustic                  and speech perception abilities of children with language                       impairment will be studied.  Preliminary research has shown that                language-impaired children have poorer discrimination abilities                 for speech perception than their age-matched peers, and                         investigation should clarify the contribution of auditory                       perceptual vs. linguistic factors for speech perception.",
