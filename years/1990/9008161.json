 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Golden Lion Tamarin Conservation Project is an                         international collaborative effort to study the behavior ecology                and sociobiology of Leontopithecus rosalia, to conserve a                       significant portion of the biodiversity remaining tin the                       Atlantic Forest of Brazil.  The Atlantic Coastal Forest has the                 highest level of endemism of any part of South America.  Among                  primates there are, in addition to several endemic species, tow                 genera that occur naturally no where else on earth.  The golden                 lion tamarin is one of these.  \u0131The muriqui, or woolly spider                   monkey (Brachyteles) is the other.!  They only survive because of               Reserves such as Poco da Antas where Dietz is doing his study.                  The project is unique among primate studies because not just a                  few, but a large number of groups are being monitored.  Knowledge               of their social behavior will allow an improved capability of                   keeping the remaining few individuals successfully in captivity.                The mating system of tamarins, generally, is among the most                     complex of any group of primates.  The detailed study of many                   groups, using marked individually identified animals, whose                     genetic structure will be known through DNA fingerprinting, will                continue to be the best and most thorough study of the variable                 social system of any tamarin.  Keeping these rare animals alive                 in the wild depends on (1) maintaining their habitat, (2) knowing               their social structure, behavior, and ecology (3) genetic                       management of remaining individuals, and (4) successful                         reintroduction of captive species into the wild.  Already this                  project has increased the number of tamarins in the wild by 25-                 30%|  The infrastructure of the proposed research includes                      training Brazilian students, construction of facilities, training               of Brazilian administrators and guards in the Reserve, and                      improvement of the conservation ethic of local communities.",
