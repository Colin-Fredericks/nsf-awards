 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of U.S. scholars in an                    international workshop on ethical and value issues that arise in                the interactions of business and the environment.  The workshop                 is to be held in Mendoza, Argentina, from November 9-11, 1989.                  The project is jointly supported by NSF and the Argentinian                     National Research Council (CONICET).  U.S. and Argentine scholars               and entrepreneurs will discuss issues of ethics and values as                   they relate to attitudes and behaviors of businesspeople towards                society and the physical environment.  Argentine participants                   will identify an agenda, issues and priorities for encouraging                  more harmonious interactions between economic and ecological                    concerns.  U.S. participants will share their experiences in                    examining and reconciling conflicting environmental and                         developmental priorities.  This sharing will help in the search                 for and emergence of (1) unique results in each country, with its               specific economic, social and ecological constraints and                        opportunities, and (2) better policies in both countries with                   respect to these constraints and opportunities.",
