 "awd_abstract_narration": "The state-of-the-art in the boring bar industry is to use                  carbide bars to achieve a high degree of stiffness. But many                    machining jobs call for a small diameter hole of great length.                  Current boring bars are limited by this length-to-diameter ratio                with ratios of 10 to 1 or greater resulting in intolerable chatter.             Attempts have been made by manufacturers to insert passive damping              devices into a cavity near the workpiece of the bar to increase                 this length-to-diameter ratio. Although this measure has met with               limited success, the improvement is sufficiently encouraging to try             other damping methods.                                                          %%%                                                                                  The purpose of this research project is to investigate the                 problem of controlling chatter on a boring bar.",
