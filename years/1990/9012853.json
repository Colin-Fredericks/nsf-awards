 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project consists of three parts: (1) the study of perfect                  competition in the context of large assignment models; (2) the                  development of a general equilibrium model of bankruptcy and                    collateral with applications to financial markets; and (3) the                  development of an extended notion of equilibrium in extensive form              games with continuous action spaces.  This research contributes a               powerful new theory of competition, general insights into the                   impact of bankruptcy on financial markets and new insights into                 ways of solving a class of bargaining problems found frequently in              economics.                                                                                                                                                      The work on characterizing competition in large assignment problems             is especially exciting because it could lead to a new way of                    conceptualizing competition that would capture as special cases                 such widely used criteria as non manipulability of prices and the               appropriation of agents' marginal contributions.  The assignment                model has a rich history as a laboratory for the development of                 important new theories such as linear programming and core theory.              Past work by the investigator and his collaborators suggests that               their study of the uniqueness of equilibrium prices in large                    assignment models could provide another new, powerful analytical                tool for economic theory.",
