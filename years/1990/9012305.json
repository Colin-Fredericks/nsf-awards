 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society (SSTS) supports research             about the intellectual and value contexts that govern the                       development and use of science and technology.  Ethics and Values               Studies, in SSTS, supports research on ethical and value aspects                of the interaction between science, technology and society.  This               research project uses the techniques of historical research to                  study a particular episode of this interaction--the nuclear winter              phenomenon.  Controversy existed from the moment of its                         announcement in the fall of 1983.  Some scientists and policymakers             criticized the initial study as being inexact and its publication               premature.  Others reacted against the way it was \"marketed\" to the             public and was the vehicle for a call for changes in national                   defense policy.  Subsequent research modified the original                      conclusions of cold and darkness, but it is widely believed that                the climatic effect would still bring disaster on a global scale.               Nuclear winter is an excellent example of the way in which many                 branches of science contribute to a discovery; of the way in which              science advances by building on earlier work; of the interaction                between science, institutions supporting science, the media, and                the public; and of the impact of science upon public policy.  In                this project, the investigator will examine the published                       literature and use interviews to craft the story of nuclear                     winter's discovery, evolution, popularization, and scientific and               public controversies.  It will highlight different normative views              of the way science and scientists should appear before the public,              and when it is appropirate to urge action by the government based               on scientific knowledge.                                                                                                                                        This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional               support is good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is highly              recommended.",
