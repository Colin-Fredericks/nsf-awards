 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thyroid gland produces several hormones which, like all hormones,           are released into the blood in which they are carried to their sites of         action in other parts of the body.  The rate of secretion of these              hormones is regulated primarily by another hormone secreted by the              anterior pituitary gland.  In addition, it has very recently been               recognized that thyroid nerves may also play some role in regulating            several aspects of thyroid hormones.  Recent preliminary studies in the         PIs' laboratory and elsewhere indicate that these neuropeptides have            dramatic effects on thyroid blood flow and thyroid hormone secretion.                                                                                           The present experiments are designed to determine the physiological             significance and the endogenous neuropeptides occurring in the thyroid          nerves.  One part of this project consists of experiments in which the          effectiveness of endogenous pools of neuropeptides play a physiological         role in regulating normal thyroid function.  In the second part of this         project, changes in thyroid blood flow and/or thyroid hormone secretion         will be induced followed by the determination of whether there are              associated changes in the size or the rate of turnover of the                   endogenous neuropeptide pools.  Such changes would also support the             notion that these peptides are important in the normal regulation of            thyroid function.  The neuropeptides studied in this  project are known         to occur in many normal tissues and numerous tumors, but very little is         yet known of their functional importance.",
