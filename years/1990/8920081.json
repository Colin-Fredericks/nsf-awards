 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is interest in developing a comprehensive                                 control theory for the class of linear time-varying                             singular systems.  To date, all existing results                                relating to the control of linear systems described                             by differential equations apply exclusively to regular                          systems, both time-invariant and time-varying and to                            time-invariant singular systems.  The stage is now                              set for bringing together the various methodologies                             popular in the control literature for the purpose of                            investigating control problems associated with time-                            varying singular systems.                                                       There is intention to exploit the available body of                             work pertaining to fundamental issues such as                                   existence and uniqueness of solutions, canonical                                forms, controllability, observability, stabilization,                           state feedback, state estimation, and dynamic                                   feedback, extending these notions to the time-                                  varying singular setting.  There are many important                             instances where the most natural way to view a                                  real-world control problem is in the time-varying                               singular context.  Hence, a rigorous theoretical                                framework for handling such situations will be                                  investigated.",
