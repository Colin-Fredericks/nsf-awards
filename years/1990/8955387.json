 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct three interrelated R & D studies on                   understanding and teaching the mathematical concepts of functions and           their graphs in the Cartesian plane.  These studies (1) elaborate the           role of concrete materials and intuitive notions in students'developing         conceptual understandings of functions and graphs' (2) develop and              examine computer-based softare and curricula for developing deep                understandings of these concepts' and (3) elaborate the role of                 interactions in learning, characterizing some limitations of learning           via the narrow bandwidth of computer-based tutorizl systems.  The               studies are as follows.                                                                                                                                         (1)  A comparison of \"apparatus-based\" learning with learning in a              purely symbolic environment.  These investigators plan to elaborate (a)         the role of intuitions about pysical objects in helping studends come to        grips with their mathematical representations, (b) the conceptual               underpinnings of robust understanding in this domain, and (c) the               mechanisms of concept acquisition.                                                                                                                              (2)  The examination of innovative curricula (a) in schools chosen for          the diversity of their student populations, with an emphasis on                 including at risk and minority students, and (b) in the project                 laboratory with a sample of students from the same schools.  These              investigations will explore the effects of each setting on the kinds of         learning that take place in it, and to see what kinds of extrapolations         can be made from the laboratory to the classroom.  This work is in              collaboration with the Interactive Mathematics Project (IMP).  IMP is           chartered with the development of pilot curricula consistent with the           new California Mathematics \"Framework\".  The units have the potential           for wide distribution.                                                                                                                                          (3)  A comparison of human and computer-based tutoring strategis.  Using        a computer-based interface named OZ, the project staff will simulate            computer-based tutoring on functions and graphs, when the tutoring is in        fact done by a person at a distance.  Comparisons of \"live\" and \"at a           distance\" tutoring will provide insights into (a) the strategies used by        human tutors that depend on personal interactions, and (b) the kinds of         constaints that need to be overcome for effective machine tutoring.",
