 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archbold Biological Station (ABS) is an independent                        ecological research facility located in south-central Florida.                  ABS conducts and promotes long-term ecological research.  In                    1988 ABS became proprietor of the 10,200 acre Buck Island Ranch,                8 miles east of the main ABS property on the Istokpoga Prairie,                 and established the John D. MacArthur Agro-ecology Research                     Center.  Dr. John Fitzpatrick, Executive Director of ABS,                       proposes installation of a Geographic Information System (GIS),                 which is a combined database manager and mapping computer system.               ABS has hired a full-time GIS technician to computerize a variety               of maps and geographically-referenced datasets (including the                   history of fires on the property) and to help resident and                      visiting scientists utilize this new facility in their research.                                                                                                     The proposed GIS installation will have an important impact                on research activities at the Archbold Biological Station.  Many                new investigators will establish research programs at ABS because               of this new computing capability, and the current group of                      resident and visiting investigators will be able to explore their               data and design new studies at new levels of sophistication.                    For example, distribution maps of plant and animal species will                 be digitized and analyzed relative to soil type and the recency                 of fires in each habitat.  Biological data will be integrated                   with hydrologic, topographic, geochemical, and historical data,                 yielding many new insights into ecological processes.",
