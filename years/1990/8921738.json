 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Henry Bunn, Mr. James Oliver will                     analyze archaeological materials to collect data for his doctoral               dissertation.  He will focus on faunal remains from the FLK site                which is located in Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania.  He will examine                   patterns of bone fracture, looking especially at details of edge                shape and conformation and, on this basis, attempt to determine                 causation.  To aid in this analysis, he will analyze bone broken                by carnivores and will also examine fracture confirmations of                   bone broken with lithic tools.  Through comparison of                           archaeological material with control samples, he should be able                 to determine the relative roles which each agency played in                     shaping the FLK assemblage.                                                                                                                                     The Olduvai FLK site dates to approximately 1.7 million years                   ago, and the archaeological materials it contains provide some of               the first evidence on early human behavior.  The faunal materials               from sites such as FLK have been the subject of intense                         archaeological disagreement.  Some researchers argue that these                 remains were brought to the site by early hominids, were broken                 open by them, and represent the results of hunting, butchering,                 and consumption.  Others argue that the bones result from                       carnivore kills and are only associated by chance with stone                    tools.  Mr. Oliver's research should help to resolve this                       question.                                                                                                                                                       This project is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  provide insight into the cultural adaptations of early hominids.                Secondly, it will help to develop general methods which can be                  applied to many archaeological sites.  Finally, it will assist in               the training of a promising young scientist.",
