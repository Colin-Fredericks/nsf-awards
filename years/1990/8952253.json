 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this program is to improve the data acquisition and                  analysis skills of undergraduate students.   This issue is                      addressed on two levels.  On the more general level data                        acquisition hardware, data storage devices, and powerful packages               for the mathematical manipulation of data will enhance the                      laboratory skills of the students.  These skills are particularly               important in problems which require real-time responses.  A                     specific subset of this problem is the acquisition and                          manipulation of images.  Students are prepared to design and build              hardware and software for interpreting biomedical images,                       including those obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),                 computerized axial tomography (CAT scan), as well as X-RAY.  The                enhancement of the undergraduate computational facility with state-             of-the-art scanning and  recording devices is needed to increase                student practical skills in this domain.                                                                                                                        Biomedical signal analysis, especially as it applies to medical                 imaging, is one of the fastest growing technologies of health                   care.  It is vital that the undergraduate engineering programs                  keep up  with the demand for well-trained, knowledgeable engineers for          this industry.",
