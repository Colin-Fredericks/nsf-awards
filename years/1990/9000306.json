 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions made by animals are affected by numerous factors.  For                example, a bird's choice among different food items can be shown                to be affected by how hungry the bird is, the relative abundance                of food types, the sequence of previous encounters with different               food items, and the amount of fat reserves the bird has stored.                 Until now, it has proved difficult, both theoretically and                      experimentally, to study the combined effects of these factors in               a meaningful way.  As a result, only a small fraction of the rich               diversity of responses that animals exhibit have been studied.                                                                                                  The current pilot project is designed to test techniques that                   will allow a more synoptic view of animal decision-making.                      Specifically, Dr. Lucas plans to test several predictions of                    caching behavior by Carolina chickadees under laboratory                        conditions.  Chickadees store food items singly in hundreds of                  different sites and retrieve this food within a period of days.                 The predictions, derived from a dynamic-programming model, will                 be tested by continuously monitoring body mass, cache size and                  caching decisions throughout the day.  Monitoring will be                       accomplished using computer-driven electronic balances and remote               sensors in potential cache sites.                                                                                                                               This work is important because it provides a methodology for                    understanding behavior in a broad context.  Decisions should                    reflect a balance of costs and benefits associated with                         alternative behaviors available to the animal.  The costs and                   benefits, in turn, are affected by current conditions and                       expected changes in these conditions.  This is as relevant to                   human behavior as it is to the behavior of non-human animals.                   Caching behavior is particularly revealing because, by caching                  food, the animal is providing for future nutritional requirements               (when the food is retrieved) to the detriment of current                        requirements (which could be satisfied by eating discovered food                immediately).  Thus, caching decisions should reflect current                   conditions and expected changes in those conditions when the food               is finally retrieved.",
