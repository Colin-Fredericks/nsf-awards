 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work on nonlinear approximation and its applications to                    numerical problems will be undertaken in this project. This type                of approximation has become increasingly important since it may                 give much smaller errors than traditional approximation methods.                Emphasis will be placed on nonlinear methods in the general                     setting of wavelet decompositions with particular attention paid                to applications to rational and spline approximations. Underlying               this work is the role played by nonlinear approximations in the                 theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and in                       problems of image and surface compression.                                         In nonlinear approximation, one replaces a linear space of                   approximating functions by a nonlinear manifold. Splines with                   free knots, rational functions and certain types of adaptive                    approximation are among the most studied examples. The advantage                of nonlinear approximation, recognized for years, is that it                    allows for better approximation of functions with singularities.                The point of view taken by researchers in this area is not to                   determine whether or not a given function can be approximated by                functions taken from some class. Rather, one begins with the                    class and asks for a characterization of all functions which may                be approximated within a prescribed error. Recent work shows that               it is possible to identify these sets with known, identifiable,                 families of functions (characterized, for example, by their                     average oscillation). Much of the best work has been confined to                one-dimesional approximation. This project will consider a                      relatively new approach to multivariate approximation. The                      traditional approach is one of breaking up the domain into                      suitable smaller domains on which approximation can be                          established. A more promising approach, using the wavelet                       concept, considers the partitioning function into more manageable               parts which lend themselves to good approximation.",
