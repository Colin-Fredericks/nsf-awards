 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Northern Hemisphere winter, most of the synoptic                    scale storm activity is observed in two widely-separated                        midlatitude stormtracks, along the east coasts of Asia and the                  United States.  There is evidence that the variability in wave                  (or storm) activity and the position of the stormtrack are                      related to low frequency variability of the basic flow in which                 they are embedded.  Further, it appears that the waves influence                the evolution of the basic flow pattern.  While much evidence has               been gathered in an averaged sense, there is still a need to                    understand the time evolution of the interactions.                                   The purpose of this research is to investigate the time                    evolution of synoptic scale waves and along the major stormtracks               and to relate it to low-frequency changes in the basic flow,                    specifically the structure of the jetstream.  The study employs a               30-year data set.  This research has important implications for                 improving medium and long range weather forecasting.                            If time permits, the PIs will also examine the relationship                     between the low-level easterly jet over Africa and the so-called                easterly or African waves.",
