 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifteen microcomputers and related hardware are being used to effect            changes in the curriculum and scientific orientation of the Department          of Psychology. The department is in the process of improving its                laboratory facilities so that major and non-major students have greater         exposure to the empirical techniques used to examine behavior. To this          end, the computers are used to allow students to perform a wide range           of experiments in a laboratory setting. The first priority is                   development of a laboratory component for the introductory level                course. The experiments conducted in this laboratory replicate                  experiments that serve as the basis for the principles being discussed          in lecture. The emphases of these labs is the analysis of specific              phenomena, the use of systematic empiricism to acquire information, and         the means for analyzing and reporting the results of an experiment. The         laboratory is also used for advanced-level classes in which students            perform a series of experiments specific to that field. The computer            facility is also available to students conducting independent research          projects. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
