 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a formal and implementable theory of               the communicative interactions that can occur within a man-                     machine dialog.  It will develop a plan-based model of the                      interaction - explicity representing the differing beliefs of the               system and the user, as well as their mutually shared beliefs                   arising from the dialog, and representing the sentences in the                  dialog explicitly as actions - both as speech acts reflecting                   immediate intentions, and as discourse acts, signalling the                     structure of the dialog.  The goal is to develop a domain-                      independent model of dialog interaction, focusing on those                      aspects that allow the system and user to monitor how well the                  dialog is understood.  In particular, the intent is to account                  for the prevalent acknowledgement behavior in dialog, and to                    provide a general account of clarifications and correction                      subdialogs.  The work also will examine how the planning model                  affects the actual interpretation of the sentences in the dialog,               concentrating on the effects the model has on speech act                        interpretation, and the interpretation of tense and aspect, and                 the generic/specific distinction.  As a result, the plan-based                  approach to language will be brought into much closer                           correspondence to the actual linguistic behavior apparent in                    natural dialogs.",
