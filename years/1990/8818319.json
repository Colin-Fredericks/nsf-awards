 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many recent advances in biological sciences have resulted                  from biochemical studies focused at the molecular level.  The                   source of these molecules is frozen tissue.  The Frozen Tissue                  Collection at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural                  Science is the largest of its kind.  It contains tissue samples                 of over 30,000 vertebrate animals, each preserved at -70 C.                     Ultracold preservation insures that proteins and the hereditary                 information itself, DNA, remain in a physiologically active                     (viable) state.  The collection is used for studies of                          comparative biochemistry, physiology, genetics, forensics and                   evolution.  Researchers throughout the United States and Canada                 regularly use the collection, which clearly constitutes a                       national resource, one not replicated in the U.S. or elsewhere.                      Frozen tissue collections are costly to maintain and                       operate.  Expensive freezers are required for ultracold                         preservation.  Manipulation of samples is very labor intensive,                 because each specimen must remain frozen (specimens must be                     sorted on dry ice).  LSU currently supplies a Ph.D. level                       curator, a graduate curatorial assistant (50% time), and utility                costs for freezers.  This project provides funds for needed                     equipment and labor to manage and computerize the collection and                make it a fully functional national resource, one capable of                    accepting and dispersing tissue samples to the research                         community.  The project will ensure that these irreplaceable                    research materials are well maintained and made readily available               to the research community.",
