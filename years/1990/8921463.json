 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an international workshop on molecular                  approaches to development in the amoebal organism Dictyostelium to              be held in Turin, Italy from September 9 to September 15, 1990.                 The meeting, organized by Prof. William F. Loomis of the University             of California-San Diego and Prof. Salvatore R. Bozzaro of the                   University of Turin, will focus on three topics:  (1) Signals and               signal transduction mechanisms that affect gene expression; (2)                 Transcriptional and post-transcriptional control mechanisms; (3)                Modifications of specific proteins and their relations to cellular              functions.                                                                                                                                                      The various applications of advanced techniques to diverse aspects              of the differentiations that occur in Dictyostelium discoideum have             been fruitful in gaining a global understanding of the mechanisms               by which a group of genetically and physiologically identical cells             can interact and diverge into specialized cell types.  The advent               of powerful molecular genetic techniques applicable to this system              has opened up many new avenues that are leading to insights                     relevant not only to Dictyostelium development but also to                      related processes that occur in all multicellular organisms,                    especially during embryogenesis.  Advances in the understanding of              complex processes in Dictyostelium have benefitted significantly                from the periodic exchange of techniques, results and points of                 view between laboratories at international meetings.  Hosting this              meeting in Italy ensures the participation of the most active                   Italian and Western Europe laboratories and will facilitate the                 rapid dissemination of new data and foster international collabora-             tions.",
