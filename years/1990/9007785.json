 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to carry out                           fundamental studies to characterize intrinsic kinetics and                      adsorption parameters for proteins in ion exchange and                          affinity chromatography systems.  The PI also proposes to                       establish the methodology for designing large-scale                             chromatography for proteins.  Several model proteins which                      have well characterized molecular weights, isoelectric                          points, amino acid sequences, and three dimensional                             structures will be studied.  Computer simulations which                         have been previously developed for isocratic operations                         will be extended to gradient elution systems.  Nonlinear                        isotherms, size exclusion, mass transfer resistances, slow                      adsorption-desorption kinetics, and other time-dependent                        adsorption phenomena such as protein aggregation and                            conformational changes will be considered in the model.                         The model and simulations will be validated with column                         experiments on ion exchange and affinity chromatography.                        After validation, the simulations can be used for designing                     more efficient and cost-effective processes by choosing                         appropriate design and operating parameters, such as buffer                     pH, types of buffer, salt concentration, feed size,                             particle size, and flow rate.",
