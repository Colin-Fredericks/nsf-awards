 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this program, the feasibility and analysis of a novel Fabry-                 Perot resonator which consists of a multiplexed volume                          hologram in the resonant cavity will be investigated for                        applications in optical communications and optical signal                       processing.  The proposed Fabry-Perot resonator has two                         unique structures.  First, the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot                       resonators are holographically fabricated in a coherently-                      coupled manner.  Thus, the stringent alignment problems                         between the two mirrors are eliminated.  Long cavity lengths                    (> 1 cm) and large aperture size (> 5 x 5 square inch) are                      also made possible by this coherently-coupled effect.  Second                   a multiplexed volume hologram (containing many                                  superimposed phase gratings) is placed in the cavity.                           Therefore, many multiplexed operations can be performed at                      the same time (i.e. high parallelism).  For example, a                          multiple-channel narrow band wavelength division multiplexer                    is realizable in a single Fabry-Perot resonator.  In addition,                  the storage capacity of the volume hologram in the resonator                    is dramatically increased due to the resonance effect.  The                     Bragg selectivity of the volume hologram in the resonator is                    also enhanced.  The proposed concept can be further                             extended to a number of potential devices, such as                              reconfigurable optical interconnects, programmable optical                      limiters, and multiple-channel optical logic elements.",
