 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model undergraduate laboratory course is developed to teach the               principles of air quality.  The interdisciplinary course will                   integrate fundamental concepts with numerical simulations and                   experimental measurements.  Students in the course will be                      provided with rigorous classroom instruction, participate in the                design and operation of experiments, and develop an appreciation                for the comparison of modeled and experimental results.                                                                                                         The sizes, properties, and removal mechanisms of particles                      suspended in the atmosphere will be investigated with aerosol                   particle sizing, filter sampling, and aerosol generation systems.               Gaseous pollutants will be measured by gas monitors.  Students                  will explore the link between pollutant concentrations and                      meteorology by coupling pollutant data with measurements from                   meteorological instruments.  A computer workstation will be used                to collect, store, analyze, and graph data.  The computer will                  also be used for numerical simulation and graphical illustrations               of pollutant emission, dispersion, transformations, and transport.              This state-of-the-art air quality principles course will also be a              model for interdisciplinary teaching.  Undergraduates participating in          the course will receive a unique education in air quality                       principles, numerical simulations, and laboratory techniques that               will provide them with the skills needed in graduate school and in              their future careers.",
