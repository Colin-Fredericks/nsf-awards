 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine snow is a generic term for all aggregated particles in the               water column which are 500um or larger in diameter. Aggregates in               this size range are abundant throughout the world's oceans. They                are composed of algae, bacteria protozoa, detritus organic and                  inorganic debris often embedded in a mucus matrix. Much of the                  surface derived matter in the ocean fluxes to the ocean interior                and sea floor as large particles of marine snow. Dr. Alldredge                  will continue her work on marine snow formation. The topic is of                significant interest in terms of nutrient regeneration in the                   ocean and the role of these particles as a potential as a food                  source. There are two areas of work which she will pursue. The                  first is to characterize the nutrient regeneration in the                       microenvironments and the second is to investigate the role of                  diatoms (phytoplankton) in flocculation. This research is a                     continuation of a very successful research project which has been               funded for the last three years.",
