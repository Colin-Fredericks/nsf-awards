Challenge grants in the range of $500-$1,000 will be awarded to                 successful applicants (to be selected by the Principal                          Investigator in consultation with the U.S. invited speakers and                 U.S. members of the organizing committee for the Symposium).                    The selection process will emphasize efforts to invite and                      assist the participation of women, underrepresented minorities,                 and younger chemists.  The IUPAC Photochemistry Symposium                       traditionally has a broad scope, fostering the fruitful                         exchange of ideas and information among scientists from the                     diverse areas that comprise the field of photochemistry.  Many                  strong international collaborations have resulted from                          interactions that were initiated at previous Symposia, and this                 benefit is anticipated to continue.",
