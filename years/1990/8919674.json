 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the goals of modern evolutionary biology is to                      understand the forces that determine the distribution and                       maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations.  Two of                the primary evolutionary forces are 1) genetic drift, the change                in gene frequency due to random processes associated with small                 population size, and 2) natural selection, the differential                     survival and reproduction of individuals.  The purpose of the                   proposed research is to quantify the relative importance of these               forces in populations of the desert plant, Linanthus parryae.                   This species flowers after winter rains, and individuals produce                either white or blue flowers.  Previous research by Dr. Sewall                  Wright, one of the founders of the field of population genetics,                suggested that the population size of this species was quite                    small, and that the two flower colors were maintained in natural                populations by random genetic drift.  The alternative hypothesis                is that different colored plants are adapted to different local                 conditions, perhaps due to contrasting  abilities to attract                    pollinators and produce seed.  Because flower color is an                       inherited trait, this selective process will cause a change in                  the genetic make-up of the population.  The  proposed research                  will identify  how random events and selective differences                      between individuals can contribute to evolutionary changes in                   plant populations.  Such information is vital to our                            understanding of biological diversity.",
