 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two year collaborative project between Walter                         D. Pilkey of the University of Virginia and Jin Dewen of                        Qinghua University, Beijing.  It is sponsored by NSF and                        the Chinese State Education Commission.                                                                                                                         In this project the concept of \"configurationless\"                              optimization will be developed and applied to the design                        of mechanical systems, with emphasis on rotating shaft                          systems.  The work will be based on the concept of the                          limiting performance of dynamic systems.  For limiting                          performance studies the optimization is conducted on a                          model for which generic (time dependent) forces represent                       those portions of the system being designed.  Four types                        of problems will be studies:  (1) extreme-disturbance                           analysis, (2) optimum system performance, (3) optimum                           system design, and (4) optimum identification of                                disturbances and values of parameters.  The goal of the                         project is to improve understanding of the optimal                              design of mechanical systems, especially rotor systems.                                                                                                         Theoretical work will be pursued while Professor Jin is                         a visiting scientist in Professor Pilkey's laboratory.                          Subsequently, Professor Pilkey will participate in                              testing and verification of the theories during his                             visit to Profesor Jin's applications laboratory at                              Qinghua.",
