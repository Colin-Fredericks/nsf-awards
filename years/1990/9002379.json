 "awd_abstract_narration": "Single crystal x-ray crystallography is the most powerful                       analytical method for structure determination of solids.  In                    synthetic inorganic, organic, bioinorganic and organometallic                   chemistry, single crystal x-ray diffraction is an invaluable                    tool for the characterization of molecular structure. Knowledge                 of molecular composition and structure helps in the development                 of new reactions of potentially general interest in catalysis                   or synthesis.                                                                                                                                                   This award from the Chemical Instrumentation Program will help                  the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Utah State                      University purchase a Four-Circle Automated Single Crystal                      X-ray Diffractometer.  The instrument is needed by members of                   the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department for research in the                   following areas of chemistry:                                                                                                                                   1.
