 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will facilitate collaboration between Professor Robert W.            Field, Department of Chemistry, Massachusetts Institute of Technology,          and Professor Soji Tsuchiya, University of Tokyo, Japan, and members            of their respective research groups.  The scientists will utilize               experimental and theoretical approaches to obtain information about             unimolecular (single molecule) chemical reactions from rotation-                vibration spectra of highly excited small polyatomic molecules                  (molecules containing more than two atoms) such as hydrogen cyanide,            sulfur dioxide, and acetylene.  Such spectra are intrinsically                  uninterpretable in the traditional spectroscopic sense.  This                   collaboration will explore new experimental ways to generate large              quantities of high-quality, interpretable spectra as well as new,               statistically based ways to obtain information from these spectra.              If successful, the effort will permit, for the first time, the                  extraction of detailed information about certain chemical processes,            such as unimolecular isomerization, from high resolution spectra of             highly energized molecules.  Knowledge of the factors controlling               intramolecular energy flow will lead to opportunities to diagnose,              design, and effect excitations localized in specific parts of a                 molecule.                                                                                                                                                       The purpose of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of           intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution in isolated, small             polyatomic molecules that are energized with chemically interesting             amounts of internal rotation-vibration excitation.  These molecules             are simple enough that they can be examined in detail by state-of-              the-art experimental and supercomputer-based theoretical techniques.            For example, the isomerization of HCN to HNC following excitation of            the molecule may be studied in this way.  Complementary experimental            and theoretical approaches in the two research groups will be                   utilized.  As a significant part of this project, graduate students             in Professor Field's group will make approximately one-month working            visits to the University of Tokyo laboratory, and associates of                 Professor Tsuchiya will make similar visits to MIT.",
