The joint conferences will attract world                                        experts in the field to discuss state-of-                                       the-art results both in analytical tool                                         development and in the nanometer-scale                                          science and technology made possible by                                         these new tools.  This is a field which is                                      rapidly producing major advances in                                             materials understanding and new device                                          technologies.  By taking advantages of the                                      presence of these experts, the proposed                                         workshop will review progress in these                                          areas; identify research opportunities,                                         assess the potential impact of nanometer                                        scale research; assess government, academic                                     and industrial research plans; and                                              recommend resource allocation strategies.                                       The results of the workshop will be                                             published in the Journal of Vacuum Science                                      and Technology in order to widely                                               disseminate the information to the                                              community.",
