 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objectives of this project are to understand how                  genes interact to specify the body plan during development.                     Several tissue specific mammalian positive transcriptional                      activators share an approximately 150 amino acid region, the POU                domain. This proposal focuses on three newly isolated POU domain                genes from Drosophila: what are their structures, what are the                  natures of their protein products, when and where in development                are they expressed, and what are the effects of perturbing their                normal expression. The DNA sequences of cDNA clones originating                 from each of the genes will show the expected structure of the                  protein products and will allow their comparison with the                       mammalian POU domain genes. Determination of the expression                     patterns of each gene by in situ hybridization and by                           immunohistochemical staining with antibodies will help indicate                 what their roles in regulating development may be. Fly strains                  containing each of the three genes under heat inducible control                 will be made. The effects of disrupting the normal expression of                the genes will also show the roles each may play in development.                %%%                                                                             A central question in developmental biology is how genes act to                 produce a complex structure. This project is to investigate that                question by examining the regulation of genes involved in early                 patterning events in the Drosophila embryo.",
