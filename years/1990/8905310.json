 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homologous chromosomes exchange segments with each other via                    \"generalized genetic recombination.\"  This process is especially                accessible in the bacterial virus lambda because of its physical                simplicity and our intimate knowledge of that virus.  Our work                  has established that each of the four identified enzymatic                      pathways that effect recombination in lambda is stimulated by DNA               double-chain breaks and suggests the view that all spontaneous                  generalized recombination is dependent upon such breaks.  The                   role played by these is not the same in all the pathways.  In                   three of the pathways (\"Red-like pathways\") the breaks                          participate directly in the recombination event while in the                    other pathway (RecBCD) the break acts as an entry site for an                   enzyme that moves along the DNA effecting recombination after it                is activated by a specific nucleotide sequence (Chi) at an                      arbitrary distance from the break.  For both types of pathway                   highly defined models have been offered.  This grant seeks to                   test those models and alternate versions of them.  A unifying                   model supposes that in both types of pathway homologous pairing                 is established between duplexes at arbitrary distance from the                  double chain-break.  In Red-like pathways, these regions of                     pairing are committed to recombination by degradation of one                    chain of the cut molecule from the cut to the region of pairing.                In the RecBCD pathway, the RecBCD enzyme, which enters at the                   cut, resolves these regions without recombination, unless the                   enzyme has lost the D subunit as a result of passing Chi or a                   Chi-like sequence.",
