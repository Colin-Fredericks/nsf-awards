 "awd_abstract_narration": "Duke University will operate the R/V CAPE HATTERAS during 1990 as               a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research                projects.  The R/V POINT SUR is a 135' general research vessel                  constructed in 1981 and owned by the National Science Foundation.               Duke operates the CAPE HATTERAS under a charter agreement with                  NSF.  The ship operates primarily off the U.S. east coast from                  Maine to Florida.                                                                                                                                               This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.",
