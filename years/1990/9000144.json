 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long.term goal of the project is to identify and describe key               processes which govern the abundance, composition and                           distribution of zooplankton in the ocean. Recent results on the                 relationship of copepod perception to clearance rate pointed to                 the significance of perception, and led to the main hypothesis,                 underlying the research proposed for the next three years.  Both,               signal perception performance, and the ability to respond to it,                determines whether prey organisms avoid, escape from, or are                    captured by predators. This project will examine the behavior of                various abundant prey (ciliates, copepod nauplii) and predators                 (nauplii, copepodites and adult copepods) found off the                         southeastern continental shelf of the U.S.A.  The results will be               used to taxonomically classify behaviors, and to calculate                      mortality rates for early juveniles of abundant species of                      copepods.  Estimates of in situ mortality rates for early                       juveniles even of the most abundant copepod species are scarce                  and very difficult to obtain. The approach of quantifying                       species.specific, and stage.specific behaviors of motion,                       feeding, etc., in relation to sensor performance and morphology,                will ultimately lead to an understanding of copepod existence and               co.existence in the ocean.  In combination with ecologically                    oriented efforts and parallel studies on the physiology of                      mechanosensors  and chemosensors the proposed studies will aid in               an understanding of what governs zooplankton behavior in the                    ocean.",
