 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to test several ideas                     concerning the dynamic processes responsible for cresting                       spatial and temporal variation in ridge geometry on the slow-                   intermediate spreading rate ridge system in the South Atlantic                  from 31 to 36 South.  Program involves two ship board legs to                   conduct geophysical studies including gravity, magnetics, and                   seismic refraction, along with Seabeam and dredging.  Shipboard                 program is to be followed by lab based geochemical analysis and                 3 dimensional numerical modeling of results.                                    %%%                                                                                  This is an exciting project from a first rate team of                      investigators who are attempting a very thorough study of                       fundamental processes at ridge crests.  The multi-disciplinary                  approach is a positive step forward, as is the idea of studying                 deep seated process such as mantle upwelling in conjunction                     with their surface expression in gravity, and geochemistry.",
