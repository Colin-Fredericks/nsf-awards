 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because the composition of bone collagen is affected by diet,                   paleoanthropologists have used analyses of both trace elements                  and isotopic ratios in skeletal remains in an attempt to                        reconstruct patterns of subsistence.  In particular, this                       approach has been employed to study the adoption of maize                       agriculture among North American Indians.  Changes in                           hypothesized diets have then been correlated with changes in                    social organization.  Because maize has a slightly different                    ratio of carbon isotopes from most native North American                        vegetation, paleoanthropologists have used variation in carbon                  12/13 ratios as an indicator of the amount of maize in the diet.                While, from an empirical perspective, the results appear                        reasonable, many details of the system are not fully understood.                Dr. Margaret Schoeninger's work is directed to filling in the                   blanks.                                                                                                                                                         Dr. Schoeninger will carry out a number of related activities.                  She will study modern samples of prehistoric strains and                        determine isotope ratios.  She will then subject such samples to                burning and other diagenetic factors to see if they affect the                  ratio.  She will also analyze a series of materials recovered                   from archaeological sites which also contain maize remains.  Bone               collagen stable isotope ratios will be determined.  Maize kernels               will then be analyzed for overall isotopic composition, as well                 as the isotopic composition of individual biochemical components                and individual amino acids.                                                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 help to develop techniques which may be used to investigate a                   number of archaeological situations.  Secondly, it will increase                our understanding of U.S. prehistory.  Finally, because the                     project includes students, it will assist in the training of                    young scientists.",
