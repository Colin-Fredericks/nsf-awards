 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development and investigation of high strength reinforced                   concrete applications comprises a major advance in building                     planning and design because of its increased capacities.  The                   present state of high strength reinforced concrete design                       needs in-depth study to accurately predict the anticipated                      performance of its many component parts under dynaic lateral                    loading such as earthquake loads.  High strength reinforced                     concrete is also a sophisticated and complex building material                  due to the large number of design and construction constraints                  which influence its quality, long term behavior, and final                      stress values.  In order to more accurately model its                           structural response, it is necessary to develop a fundamental                   data-base of performance standards.                                                                                                                             The proposed project is concerned with the development of                       design and detailing criteria for transverse reinforcement in                   high rectangular columns with compressive strengths exceeding                   15,000 psi.  Its objectives are to determine methods to                         provide sufficient ductility for earthquake-resistant                           structures.  The research plan includes both experimental and                   analytical studies.  At least twelve large-scale column                         specimens will be tested and be subjected to axial and                          repeated lateral loads at increasing displacements.  From                       these tests, data will be collected for the analytical                          documentation of the effects of concrete compressive strength,                  axial load, and types of transverse reinforcement on the                        ductility of high strength concrete columns.",
