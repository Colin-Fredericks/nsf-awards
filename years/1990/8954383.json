 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop on Computational Chemistry and Molecular Design for twelve         undergraduate faculty provides hands-on experience with a number of             computer programs in computational chemistry and molecular design               suitable for use at the undergraduate level.  It is intended as an              introduction to molecular structure drawing, energy minimization using          the molecular mechanics approach, molecular orbital calculations using          semiempirical methods, dynamical calculations on small biomolecules, and        graphical manipulation of molecular structures and data.  The workshop          is being held at the Molecular Design Laboratory at California State            University, Fullerton and includes a five-day session in June, 1990,            with a two-day follow-up session in January 1991 for presentation of            interim project results.  Participants from throughout the United States        work with IBM and Macintosh personal computers, a Sun graphics                  workstation and DEC and Prime supermini-computers.  Participants take           back to their home institutions extensive written material and examples         for direct implementation, reference or for future development and              customization.  Curricular implementation of computational chemistry and        molecular design projects is described and discussed throughout the             workshop.                                                                                                                                                       The home institutions of the participants are contributing the costs of         travel for the faculty who are participating in the workshop.",
