 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish at Hampton University a multi-year                  Research Experience and Enrichment program for engineering,                     mathematics, and science students.  The aim is to attract                       students into research, train them, and channel them into graduate              programs at major research institutions upon graduating from college.           Within a period of five years, 40 students selected from the                    discipline areas of biological sciences, chemistry, engineering,                marine science, mathematics, and physics will participate in this               project.  Ongoing research programs at Hampton University will form             the framework upon which research activities for participating                  students will be based. The students who participate in this project            are provided financial support not only as incentive for pursuing               scientific research, but also to help reduce their financial burdens            and make graduate school a competitive career option after graduation.",
