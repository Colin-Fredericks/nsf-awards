 "awd_abstract_narration": "How and why school systems grow have received considerable                 attention in sociology within the last two decades.  Generally,                 research shows that factors often thought to be determining -                   such as population growth or industrialization - actually have                  little effect.  Social and cultural factors such as national                    independence and a search for a national identity are often                     directly related to growth in education.  These effects became                  visible as the result of theoretical work identifying the causal                factors, and new techniques in historical sociological analysis.                This proposal is to examine how the social definition of                        'delinquent' and 'exceptional' populations of children affect                   growth of school systems through a desire to 'contain' those                    populations.  The theory proposes that the two populations                      initially will be thought quite distinct, but will come to occupy               a similar place in schools through the containment function.  A                 parallel analysis applies, with slight modifications, to the                    education of females and non-whites.  The theory will be tested                 using archival data from eight states, four in which compulsory                 education developed recently, and four older school systems.                    Outcomes will include testing the theory and establishing a large               data set of school, legal, and political records available to                   other investigators.",
