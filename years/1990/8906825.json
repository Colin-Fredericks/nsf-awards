 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beetles of the Family Staphylinidae comprise one of the most               diverse insect families known.  Among the staphylinids, members                 of the genus Platydracus are large and conspicuous predators on                 fly larvae and a variety of forest-dwelling invertebrates.  As                  such, they play an important role in the ecology of tropical                    forests.  Dr. Alfred Newton proposes completion of a taxonomic                  monograph of the New World representatives of the genus,                        including description of 70 new species and production of an                    identification key.  Evolutionary relationships will be                         reconstructed using cladistic analysis, and the geographic                      distribution of species will be compared to their evolutionary                  relatedness.                                                                         The proposed monograph will find a wide and keenly                         interested audience among forest ecologists, systematic and                     economic entomologists, biogeographers, and evolutionary                        biologists.  Specifically, ecologists will use the monograph as                 an identification guide in their studies of community structure;                entomologists may want to pursue possible natural control                       mechanisms within the genus, biogeographers will use the group as               a further test of the Pleistocene refugium hypothesis, and                      evolutionary biologists will use the monograph as a platform on                 which to study the evolution of ecological specializations.",
