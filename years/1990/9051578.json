 "awd_abstract_narration": "The computer controlled coordinate measuring machine (CMM) represents           a final phase in the development of a computer integrated                       manufacturing (CIM) system.  It is an addition to the current                   facilities that includes a 30 station PC based computer aided design            drafting laboratory using AutoCad software; a Harris mini computer              using CAD/CAM software; an 18 station PC manufacturing management               laboratory featuring manufacturing resource planning and simulation             software, and a three machine computer numerical control (CNC)                  laboratory scheduled for upgrade.  All are integrated via Novel                 software and an IBM Token-Ring computing network.                                                                                                               The CIM has become a part of the CIM network and, using the CMM                 software, is able to inspect parts from projects developed in the               CAD and CAM Laboratories.  The CMM is used primarily by the Materials           Testing and Measurements Class, but has impact on Statistical Quality           Control and other courses using the CAD and CAM facilities.  The                award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                    investigator's institution.",
