 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support research on several problems in                  the areas of nonlinear harmonic analysis and partial differential               equations.  Among the topics to be studied are the method of                    layer potentials for the heat equation in time-varying domains,                 Hardy spaces and boundary value problems for operators of Dirac                 type on Lipschitz domains, the characterization of the spaces of                uniform holomorphy for partial sum operators for classical                      expansions, the calculation of the spectral radius of the trace                 of the double-layer potential for harmonic functions in certain                 domains, and applications of nonlinear harmonic analysis to                     problems in nonlinear partial differential equations.                                Nonlinear harmonic analysis emerged and developed in                       response to the challenges posed by difficult problems in                       classical analysis, particularly, but not exclusively, those                    arising from the study of partial differential equations.  It is                anticipated that applications of this work will lead to a better                understanding of potential theory and the parabolic partial                     differential equations of heat flow.",
