 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project utilizes recent developments in dynamical systems                  theory in the analysis of engineering dynamics problems.                        Specifically, local and global bifurcation techniques are used to               predict dynamics behavior as a function of system parameters, as                well as to describe them.  The research focuses on four classes                 of systems, including the use of input waveform for the                         suppression of chaos in periodically forced oscillators, the                    stability of modes at rest in systems which have active modes                   undergoing chaotic dynamics, nonlinear dynamic interactions in                  rotating mechanical systems, and simple models for the dynamic                  response of mechanisms with flexible linkages.  A widening gap                  between theoretical developments and applications in the field of               nonlinear dynamics has occurred in recent years.  This research                 is a direct attempt to bridge that gap by employing modern                      analytical and numerical tools in the investigation of specific                 mechanical systems.",
