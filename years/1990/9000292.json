 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Dr. Josef Michl at the University of Texas at                Austin.  This work will provide new insights into the nature of                 short-lived intermediates that are formed in the course of                      chemical reactions and will also develop new approaches to                      chemical measurements using a \"molecular-size construction set\".                                                                                                The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Michl fall into                 two categories.  The first is focused on biradical                              intermediates, which will be generated by photolytic or                         pyrolytic processes and then be trapped in a low-temperature,                   inert-gas matrix.  Electronic and vibrational spectroscopic                     studies will afford an improved understanding of the structure                  and reactivity of these unstable species.  The second category                  is centered on Michl's staffane hydrocarbons, which are                         rod-like molecules made up of recurring bicyclo\u01311.1.1!pentane                   subunits.  These \"molecular Tinkertoys\" provide a unique                        opportunity for studying the transmission of electronic effects                 through a molecular framework.  Professor Michl will also take                  advantage of the linear shape of these molecules to link these                  molecules together and form supramolecular assemblies with                      well-defined molecular structures.",
