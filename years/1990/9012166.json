 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have long used overlapping generations and                           neoclassical growth models to explore important empirical and                   theoretical issues in public finance, development, international                trade, savings and monetary policy. Recently, some researchers                  have attacked the way these models characterize the long run                    tendency of the economy. This project will study the                            mathematical equations which economists use to codify and apply                 these models and investigate the relationship between the                       empirically determined parameters and the corresponding long run                properties of the models. Since the equations which codify the                  assumptions of the models can lead to bizarre behavior when these               models are used in practice, the models could give misleading                   forecasts of the behavior of the economy. By applying state of                  the art computer programming techniques, formulae for                           characterizing the plausible ranges of parameters of interest                   will be developed.                                                                                                                                              The concept of determinacy developed by Laitner and Anderson-                   Moore will be applied to identify fixed-point and limit cycles                  which possess stability properties that imply unique convergent                 trajectories from nearby points. The project will focus on                      discrete time models. Analytic expressions for specific utility                 and production functions will be developed when general formulae                are unattainable. The asymptotic stability of these models will                 be investigated for empirically relevant ranges of model                        parameters in order to characterize the plausibility and                        relevance of the potentially complex asymptotic behavior when                   confronting real world data.  The project will begin an                         investigation of the global convergence properties of these                     models with the objective of developing \"higher order\" turnpike                 theorems characterizing conditions guaranteeing convergence to                  limit cycles of a given periodicity.",
