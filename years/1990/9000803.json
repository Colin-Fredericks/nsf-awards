 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morphometrics is the study of shape and shape change, and it               combines aspects of geometry and statistics.  Morphometrics has                 wide applications in systematic biology: quantitative description               of species and their differences; characterization of the changes               that occur during the development of an individual organism and                 the evolution of a lineage; and the study of processes that                     impact on these differences and changes.  The field of                          morphometrics has made rapid advances in the past decade,                       stemming from the availability of desk-top image analysis systems               driven by microcomputers, and the development of several new                    conceptual approaches to the capture of biological shape                        information.  The limiting factors to the further growth of                     biological morphometrics have been the lack of appropriate                      microcomputer software, and the high training threshold that                    investigators face when attempting to use morphometrics in their                research.  The Systematic Biology Program of the National Science               Foundation supported a two-week training workshop at the                        University of Michigan in 1988, during which 35 faculty-level                   researchers were given hands-on training in morphometrics.  Since               that workshop, a new battery of software packages have been                     developed by the instructors, to be published with the Workshop                 Proceedings volume in 1990.  Dr. Michael Bell and F. James Rohlf                propose a second two-week morphometrics training workshop, to be                held on the Stony Brook campus of the State University of New                   York.  The Proceedings volume and associated software will be the               principal material used in the course, which will train                         approximately 30 systematic biology researchers in the latest                   approaches to morphometrics.                                                         The proposed training workshop will have wide implications                 throughout systematic and evolutionary biology.  The participants               will represent different taxonomic groups and research                          philosophies, and they will return to their host institutions                   after the workshop prepared to use and teach the use of an                      important new research tool.  They will be in a position to write               competitive grant proposals for equipment acquisition and                       morphometric research.  During the workshop, possible new                       approaches will be discussed and the place of morphometrics in                  systematic research will take new form.  The workshop will be an                important test of the software prior to publication.  Training                  workshops such as this are cost-effective ways to disseminate new               methodologies and technologies.",
