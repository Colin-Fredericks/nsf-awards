 "awd_abstract_narration": "A mentoring network linking college science, mathematics, and                   engineering students with grade 4-8 urban students in                           Philadelphia has been successfully established on a pilot                       basis.  This project will build on the pilot and will                           increase the emphasis on participation in the network by                        school science teachers and by science faculty from the                         University of Pennsylvania. The focus of the mentoring                          network is an intervention model in science and mathematics                     education which includes classroom and after-school                             activities. Mentors engage students in hands-on activities in                   non-threatening and fun learning environments and work with                     pupils and teachers to form science clubs, participate in                       science fairs, and embark on a variety of field trips.  An                      important part of this project is a research component  which                   will be used to evaluate the monitoring network model and to                    build and maintain a data base to be used for further                           studies. Cost sharing in the amount of $18,504 is 3% of the                     NSF contribution to this project.",
