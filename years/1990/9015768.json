It will be operated by nine                      members of the Southern Association of Marine Laboratories                      (SAML), and 36 Historically Minority Colleges and Universities                  (HMCUs).  Additional HMCUs will be encouraged to participate in                 the project during its second year.  The three major components                 are:  provision of support for minority students to participate                 in courses and research at SAML institutions; provision of                      academic interactions between SAML members and HMCUs (seminars,                 faculty visits, marine familiarization programs); and provision                 of marine field trip experience to colleges and universities                    whose student bodies are dominated by minority students.  These                 proposed activities will reach more than 350 students and 75                    faculty annually.",
