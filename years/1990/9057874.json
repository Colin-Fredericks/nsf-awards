 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design a 'process-oriented' environment          architecture and build tools to effectively support software                    development in a distributed work-station environment.                          A process-oriented environment architecture presents itself to the              user (e.g., software developer or manager) as a collection of                   methodological tools supporting the planning and specification of               explicit software process models and their controlled execution,                rather than as a collection of tools supporting isolated development            activities (e.g., coding or testing).                                                                                                                           This project involves work in a variety of areas including process              modeling, environment architectures, measurement, reuse and learning,           and experience bases.  Example research and development tasks include:                                                                                          o Design of a process-specification driven environment architecture                                                                                             o Definition and implementation of a comprehensive process                        specification language                                                                                                                                        o Use of measurement data in characterizing project goals and                     selecting the appropriate software processes to achieve them                                                                                                  o Design and implementation of process execution support                                                                                                        o Using measurements to improve existing process specifications.",
