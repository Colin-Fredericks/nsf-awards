 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an application for partial funding of a conference on the               molecular biology of organelles, being held under the auspices of               the University of Florida from February 22-25, 1990 at the                      Belleview Biltmore, Clearwater Florida.  Participation will be                  limited to 200 scientist applicants who will be selected on the                 basis of their expertise and interests as being the most likely                 to help create a stimulating and informative meeting.  The topic                of the meeting focuses on DNA containing organelles in animals,                 plants and fungi and will emphasize research on control of                      replication and transcription, post-transcriptional regulation,                 nuclear-mitochondrial interactions, protein targeting, and                      genetics and evolution.  The conference will consist of five,                   half-day scientific sessions, each with six speakers; in addition               two afternoons will be devoted to poster sessions.  All session                 chairpersons have been invited and have accepted, and most other                speakers have been confirmed as well.  We anticipate this meeting               to become a regular organelle molecular biology conference in                   years when no Gordon or Cold Spring Harbor Conference is offered.",
