 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Buechler's research in mathematical logic is in                  stability theory, a subfield of model theory.  In recent years                  several general model-theoretic problems have been systematically               approached via the stability hierarchy.  Even though the problem                itself may not involve stability-theoretic notions, considering                 separately the cases:  omega-stable, superstable, etc., brings                  into play a mass of technical machinery.  Such is the case for                  Vaught's conjecture, which was proved by Shelah for omega-stable                theories.  The next step is to consider all superstable theories,               but this has proved too difficult for the methods used in the                   omega-stable case.  What is required is an analysis which is                    sensitive to the way in which, e.g., sets of rank alpha are                     pieced together to form sets of rank alpha plus one.  Buechler                  will continue with this geometrical approach to the problem,                    which has already yielded significant results.",
