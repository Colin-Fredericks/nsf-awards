 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support for an analytical instrument                        designed to separate and quantify lipid classes.  The                           instrument, known commercially as an Iatroscan, combines two                    principles: thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with flame                          ionization detection (FID).  The advent of the Iatroscan, less                  than a decade ago, made possible sensitive, rapid quantitation                  of lipid classes from planktonic organisms, seston, and                         sediments.  Lipid class composition from as little as a single                  copepod can be analyzed, now permitting lipids to be used as a                  tool in the study of population biology.  Purchase of an                        Iatroscan will permit one study to be completed and a                           preliminary exploration conducted as a foundation for future                    research.  First, the effects of an oceanic front on copepod                    nutrition will be evaluated.  The hypothesis will be tested                     that interspecific differences exist in nutritional responses                   of 3 suspension-feeding copepods to the Ensenada front, a                       persistent, deep-water frontal system in the California                         Current.  The species of interest are Eucalanus californicus,                   Metridia pacifica, and Calanus pacificus californicus.  Storage                 lipids (wax esters, triacylglycerols) and gut fluorescence will                 be used as \"condition factors,\" to assess the nutritional                       status of these 3 species on a series of lines that intersect                   the frontal region.  Secondly, the possibility that vertically                  subdivided copepod populations can be differentiated by lipid                   profiles will be explored.  The latter issue bears on the                       problem of the continuous/discontinuous character of                            zooplankton population growth as well as the vertical transport                 of lipids by migratory zooplankton.  Both the effects of the                    Ensenda front on zooplankton nutrition and the vertical lipid                   variation study will be done with existing zooplankton samples                  that were collected for this purpose and frozen during cruises                  in 1988 (ZBI and Fronts '88).",
