 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal aims to characterize the constitutive isoform of                  nitrate reductase that is present in soybeans and uses either                   NADH or NADPH as reductant.  Monoclonal antibodies will be                      generated and used to study epitopes of this isoform and also                   used to purify large quantities of this isoform by immunoaffinity               chromatography.  The protein will then be characterized                         biochemically, and a cDNA clone will be prepared by screening a                 lambda gt11 library.                                                                                                                                            Nitrogen is the mineral nutrient that most often limits the                     growth of agricultural crops.  In well aerated soils, fertilizer                nitrogen is mostly present in the form of nitrate, which the                    plants must internally convert to ammonia before the nitrogen can               be used to produce the compounds that make up plant proteins.                   The enzyme nitrate reductase initiates this conversion, and in                  soybean there are three different forms of the enzyme present.                  The new work to be carried out in Dr. John Smarrelli's laboratory               provides fundamental information about the properties of one                    specific form of this enzyme.  Successful completion of this                    approach can be expected to provide insights that will ultimately               assist in increasing the efficiency of the process of nitrate                   utiliztion by plants.",
