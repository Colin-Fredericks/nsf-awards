 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in algebraic geometry of                  Professor Andrew Sommese of the University of Notre Dame. Dr.                   Sommese's project is to continue his research on hyperplane                     sections of complex projective manifolds and the projective                     classification of complex varieties. He will also continue his                  studies of the zero-dimensional subschemes of smooth complex                    projective varieties.                                                                This is research in the field of algebraic geometry, one of                the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                 revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                     origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                        robotics.",
