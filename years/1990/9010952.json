 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modeling microeconomic transaction costs is essential for a                     better understanding of the behavior of most macroeconomic                      variables over time like consumer durables, business investment,                inventories, employment, and prices.  In order to obtain a                      genuinely structural interpretation of the time series properties               of these variables, a careful treatment both of the underlying                  microeconomic problem and of the aggregation process is                         necessary.  Available microeconomic models of dynamic adjustment                in the presence of realistic transaction costs predict that                     individual units should not react to every innovation in their                  environment, and that they may react discontinuously to those                   innovations that trigger adjustment of variables determined by                  the model.  The purpose of this research is to extend available                 models of infrequent microeconomic adjustment, to analyze their                 implications for aggregate phenomena, and to test these                         implications and assess their quantitative relevance.  This                     research is important because it will provide a better                          understanding of the degree to which transaction costs at the                   micro level might provide a plausible microeconomic foundation                  for explaining the business cycle.",
