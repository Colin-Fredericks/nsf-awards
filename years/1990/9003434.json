 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is to: (a) study the problem of current surges in GaAs and        ECL circuits to better understand their impacts on chip reliability, (b)        develop automated techniques to analyze power, ground and clock                 distribution systems in order to detect potential reliability problems,         (c) find design rules required for enduring reliability, and (d)                incorporate design rules and guidelines into tools for design of high           performance circuits.  Transmission line models for interconnects in            IC's are being explored.  Analysis methods based on numerical techniques        coupled with transmission line theory are being developed.  Optimization        techniques are being devised for solving problems of effective                  utilization of chip area.  The study of current surges is being                 approached using experimental, stochastic and analytic techniques.",
