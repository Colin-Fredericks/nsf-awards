 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the dissertation research of a cultural                     anthropologist who will study the negotiation of social power                   through the shaping of traditional Black music styles in the                    South African music industry.  The student will study the                       production process in the recording studio, where engineers and                 music producers contest and negotiate the content and cultural                  qualities of the music being recorded.  The basic issues to be                  examined are the sources of control over the content of the                     music.   Methods include ethnographic participant observation of                several studios in Johannesburg; recording and transcription of                 the work in progress, open ended interviews with participants,                  observation of talent scouting trips into the rural areas, and                  observation of live performances.                                                                                                                               The power of popular music to define the cultural position of                   people in their society is striking throughout the world.                       Understanding how the cultural content of music gets produced in                this particular case (as more or less traditional in a context                  where tradition is related to race in a complex way) can aid                    understanding of the function of music in multi-ethnic society in               general.",
