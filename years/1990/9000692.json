The program will immerse students in a highly interactive, research             oriented environment.  The major tenet is that success in science               depends on understanding the context of research, as well as the                substance and procedures of a particular discipline.  Program goals             are:  (1) to provide intensive training in ecological research; (2)             to broaden students' perspectives; (3) to give students direct                  exposure to the life of a research scientist; and (4) to promote                an understanding of ecology.   Eight students will be brought to                the Institute for a twelve-week summer program.  The program will               include the following components:  (1) Student Research Projects;               (2) Research Strategies for the Undergraduate, a series of                      intensive training sessions; (3) Research in Context,  a seminar                series designed to broaden students' perspectives on the various                components and applications of science; (4) Forum on Opportunities              in Ecology, a full-day program with representatives from a broad                spectrum of ecological and related disciplines; and (5)                         supplementary activities.  Under the guidance of a mentor                       scientist, each student will delineate a research question and                  associated hypotheses, select appropriate methods, and develop a                research plan.  Students will then implement the project, finishing             with analysis and report writing.  Presentations in a formal                    Research Symposium will conclude the summer program.  Final Papers              will be collated and published as an IES Occasional Publication.",
