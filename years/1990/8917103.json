Such                      reactions are also known to be important controls on the vent                   fluid chemistry in geothermal systems.  It is thus important to                 understand the factors influencing the rates of these mineral                   reactions, since their timing relative to the production of oil                 or gas can be crucial to the development of major hydrocarbon                   reserves, or alternatively their timing may strongly influence                  the locus or extent of mineralization in hydrothermal ore                       deposits.  This project will initiate  a series of hydrothermal                 experiments which quantitatively evaluate the influence of fluid                chemistry, grain size (surface area), temperature and pressure                  on reaction rates for mineral reactions involving calcite and                   plagioclase feldspar, phases which have been shown to                           significantly affect the porosity inventory of petroleum                        reservoirs, and are demonstrably important to the chemistry of                  geothermal fluids.  The use of isotopic tracers to measure                      kinetic and thermodynamic parameters is a new experimental                      approach which is especially well suited to the study of sediment               diagenesis and hydrothermal alteration processes, where                         reactions often proceed very close to equilibrium.",
