 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surveys of genetic variation in natural populations of                     marine organisms, particularly bivalves, have revealed a curious                paradox:  many genes show a deficiency of heterozygotes compared                to frequencies expected under population genetic theory, yet at                 the same time heterozygous individuals appear to enjoy enhanced                 growth and survival.  The reasons for this situation can only be                understood by controlled laboratory experiments.                                     In this project, over a hundred families of the coot clam,                 Mulinia lateralis, will be produced and reared in the laboratory.               By comparing the genotypes of the parents and offspring in each                 family for a series of genes, the investigators will be able to                 determine the origin(s) of the numerical deficiency  and enhanced               fitness of heterozygote.  One potential source is spontaneous                   chromosomal aberrations (aneuploidy) of the same type that cause                a large proportion of birth defects in humans.  If this proves to               be the case, marine bivalves could become valuable model systems                for the study of aneuploidy.  Alternatively, if the fitness                     differences are attributable to biochemical differences in the                  gene products, this finding will further aid our understanding of               the evolutionary significance of genetic variation in natural                   populations.",
