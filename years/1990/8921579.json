 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a fundamental study of diamond                         synthesis in flames.  Diamond growth in low-pressure, one-                      dimensional H2/O2/Ar-CH4 and C2H2/O2/Ar flames will be                          investigated and the conditions for which growth occurs will                    be determined.  The experiments are designed to provide a                       well-characterized growth environment with known chemistry.                     Growth experiments will be carried out using both thin-wire                     micro-substrates which do not perturb the flame significantly                   and large-area substrates designed to maintain a one-                           dimensional flowfield in the gap between the burner and                         substrate.  The one-dimensional flowfield is predicted to                       result in uniform large-area film growth.                                                                                                                       The flames will be thoroughly characterized.  Stable species                    profiles will be measured using a quartz probe and an on-line                   sampling mass spectrometer, and radical profiles (H, CH3, C,                    OH, CH, and C2) and temperature profiles will be measured                       optically using laser-induced fluorescence, resonance-enhanced                  multiphoton ionization, and vibrational Raman scattering.  The                  measurements will be made both with and without the substrate,                  and will be compared to the predictions of a one-dimensional                    reacting flow model with detailed kinetics.  These experiments                  will be the first study of diamond growth in a truly well-                      characterized environment, and will yield significant                           information on the processes responsible for diamond growth.",
