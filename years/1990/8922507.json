 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last fifty or sixty years, there has been an ongoing                   debate concerning the impact of cameras in the courtroom.  In                   some landmark legal cases, courts have sometimes banned the use                 of microphones and cameras fearing that the jurors would be                     biased by the \"carnival-like\" media coverage.  In 1965, the                     Supreme Court overturned a major conviction on the grounds that                 the defendant was denied a fair trial due to the intense media                  coverage which psychologically distracted the participants and                  impaired their attentiveness, memory, and credibility.  In 1981,                the Supreme Court again considered the question of televising                   criminal trials and adopted a states' rights position on the use                of electronic media coverage (EMC) for state criminal trials.                   Although news cameras are still banned from Federal courts, 44                  states now permit EMC of proceedings on a permanent or                          experimental basis.  Proponents of EMC have argued that the bans                or restrictions are unwarranted and that there is little                        empirical data on which to base a constitutional judgment about                 the issue.  There has been some sporadic research undertaken by                 social scientists to address the issue using simulated courtrooms               and surveys, but this research has been inconclusive.                                                                                                           Drs. Borgida and Penrod will undertake the first true                           experimental research in a courtroom in order to better                         understand the effects of news media on the proceedings.  They                  will study 90 to 120 criminal and civil trials over a two year                  period in one state.  Using randomly assigned cases to EMC                      coverage, sketch artist coverage, or no media representation,                   data will be collected on a broad range of measures designed to                 assess courtroom functioning such as the credibility, accuracy,                 memory, nervousness of witnesses, media obtrusiveness, and                      satisfaction with proceedings and the decision process.                                                                                                         This research will provide scientifically sound data on a key                   constitutional issue concerning the potential conflict between                  free press and due process in trials with media coverage.  In                   addition, it should advance basic understanding of legal                        decisionmaking.  More broadly, the quality and character of                     decisionmaking under stress has been the focus of considerable                  research in judgment research, social psychology, and cognitive                 science.  The results of this unique opportunity to conduct                     experiments in the courtroom will allow assessments of actual                   subjective and objective effects.  Empirically testable                         assumptions about human behavior are crucial to a fully informed                appraisal of the advantages and disadvantages associated with                   technological innovation.",
