 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fertilization can dramatically alter the structure of                      herbaceous plant communities, and the manipulation of soil                      fertility levels can offer insight into the mechanisms of species               coexistence in nature.  This project will experimentally test the               interaction between competition and soil fertility in an old-                   field community by manipulating both the presence of dominant                   species and the level of soil resources.  Experiments will                      consist of complete or partial removals of the 2 dominant                       species, Dactylis glomerata and Solidago altissima, alone                       together at low (control) and high (enriched) soil fertility                    levels.  The effect on species richness, diversity, and other                   community properties will be followed.  In complementary                        experiments, varying amounts of Dactylis seed will be sown in a                 newly plowed field to test the effects on community development                 of the initial presence and abundance of a dominant species.  The               study will be the first attempt to investigate whether                          competition with the dominant species has a different effect on                 community structure at high than at low soil resource levels.                   The data from these experiments will test a number of major,                    previously untested theories regarding the basis for coexistence                among plants in natural communities.",
