This is the second conference of this title, the                   first, held in February 1987.  The purpose of this second                       conference is to ascertain where laser development                              efforts in the UV and VUV should be directed;  to                               identify fundamental photochemical, spectroscopic kinetic                       issues; and to reexamine industrial and commercial                              efforts and research needs in light of recent progress in                       VUV source.  This will be accomplished by assembling                            approximately 100 of the leading researchers in the area,                       and interspersing overview talks of current and potential                       applications of VUV and UV lasers with invited papers                           highlighting crucial issues in laser development.  Support                      from NSF is sought specifically to enable the attendance                        of young investigators whose research program has not                           yet been built to the point of affording this conference.",
