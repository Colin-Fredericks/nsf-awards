 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this project are to elucidate host-symbiont          relationships and to formulate a comprehensive theory for the                   integration of newly acquired symbionts into host cells leading to the          acquisition of new cell components and changes in cellular phenotypic           characters.  In the recently established amoeba-bacteria symbiosis,             symbiotic bacteria were originally harmful to the hosts but changed to          required cell components within a few years, bringing about many changes        in cell characters.  The specific aims are to test the following 4              hypothesis: 1) That the symbiont-produced 29-kD protein is a factor             required by host amoebae for their survival, 2) that the symbiosome             membrane has a \"fusion-preventing\" component which is responsible for           the prevention of lysosomal fusion with symbiosomes, 3) that the plasmid        DNAs of symbiotic X-bacteria code for cell-surface components of X-             bacteria that confer them resistance to digestion and their infectivity         and 4) that the X-bacteria came from one of the bacterial strains               normally living in the amoeba culture.  These studies will use                  immunocytochemical methods with monoclonal antibodies, gene cloning,            nucleotide sequencing, gel electrophoresis, micrurgy, and other                 biochemical and molecular-biological techniques.                                    Expected results will not only enhance our understanding of the             mechanisms for the establishment and maintenance of stable                      endosymbiosis, but also will provide insight into the origin of new cell        components in eukaryotic cells and cellular character changes.  In              addition, some of the results might be applicable in therapeutic                research on diseases caused by infective agents, in which such agents           avoid digestion by the host cells probably by similar mechanisms.                  //",
