 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important line of inquiry to shed light on changing                     environmental conditions has been the reconstruction of past climatic           histories through paleoecological analyses.  The loess deposits of the          Lower Mississippi Valley offer a rich source of material within which           scientists have been analyzing the changing composition of sediments,           pollen, and fossilized plants and animals.  One particularly promising          approach has been the isotopic analysis of fossil land snails.                  Isotopic analysis of land snails in the Lower Mississippi Valley has            focused so far on one site in Mississippi.  This doctoral dissertation          research project will broaden the analysis to include samples from six          additional sites in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  Carefully            selected bulk samples from each site will be gathered; snails and               carbonic concretions will be removed; the snails will be cleaned,               dried, and identified; and their shell fragments will be tested to              determine their ages.  The information gathered in this manner then             will be correlated with information on the paleoecology of the region           gathered from other sources.                                                         This project will offer valuable insights on a number of fronts.           From a methodological perspective, it will provide a means of                   evaluating the efficacy of sampling and evaluating fossil land snails           from a number of sites.  The project also offers prospects of adding to         our knowledge about climatic and environmental conditions in the Lower          Mississippi Valley during the latter stages of the Pleistocene Epoch,           and it will contribute to our improved understanding of dynamic                 interactions among terrestrial, fluvial, oceanic, eolian, and                   biological systems during a period of substantial environmental change.         It also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young             scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
