 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the study of the steady                     states of partial differential equations.  In particular, the                   principal investigator is interested in existence, multiplicity                 and symmetry questions for solutions of semilinear elliptic                     problems.  The project consists of two parts.  In the first part                the principal investigator considers semilinear problems                        involving a parameter and studies the solution structure of the                 problem for the parameter in a neighborhood of an eigenvalue of                 the linear part of the problem.  Here the principal investigator                is mainly interested in semilinear problems whose nonlinear part                involves bounded oscillatory terms (Sine Gordon type problems).                 For such problems the multiplicity of ground states (positive                   solutions) appears intimately dependent upon the dimension of the               independent variable and the geometry of the underlying domain.                 In fact, very little is known for domains which are not convex.                 In the second part the principal investigator studies the                       question of symmetry breaking and the development of interior and               boundary layers for positive solution branches of semilinear                    elliptic problems.  Here the principal investigator is mainly                   interested in problems where the domain is either a sphere or a                 convex domain with certain reflection symmetries.",
