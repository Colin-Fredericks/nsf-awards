 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to design, construct,                  and validate a reliable calibration system for preparing ultra-                 trace gas standards for five sulfur-containing compounds;                       hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, carbonyl sulfide, carbon                      disulfide, and dimethylsulfide.  Although these sulfur species                  are of major atmospheric importance, the measurement                            equivalency of the different analytical methods used for their                  analysis is often unknown.  Consequently, an intercomparison                    project is being developed by the scientific community to                       address this issue.                                                                  The central calibration system built during this initial                   phase of the overall intercomparison project will provide the                   reference gas standards required to access the performance                      characteristics of the various analytical techniques.  This                     calibration system will consist of a three-stage dynamic                        dilution apparatus that contains a source of sulfur-free zero                   dilution air, an all-Teflon flow network, compressed gas                        cylinders as the source of each sulfur gas, electronic mass-                    flow controllers for the precise regulation of all gas flows,                   and separate inlet systems for the introduction of potential                    matrix interferences.  Concentrations of the sulfur gas                         standards prepared by the calibration system will cover a range                 from 950 pptv to 12pptv and                                                     have a maximum uncertainty of less than 7%.//",
