 "awd_abstract_narration": "During World War II, Joseph Needham was sent as the British Science             Attache to the beleaguered Chinese government which was fighting                off the invading Japanese Army.  This visit by an eminent biologist             and member of the Royal Society precipitated a life-long                        fascination with the development of Chinese science and technology.             Forty years ago, Needham launched \"Science and Civilization in                  China.\"  It has grown to an international effort to document the                full range of scientific and technological developments in                      traditional China, one of the most advanced of non-Western                      scientific traditions.  15 volumes have already been completed, 14              more are in various stages of completion.  The NSF has been                     supporting American participation in this project for the past 10               years.  With this grant, the project should reach completion with               the final volume going to press in 1994.  Not only will this grant              provide support for the continuing research effort, but, as                     important, will provide support for 4 graduate students to train                with Needham at his Institute in Cambridge.  Thus, a new generation             of students of Chinese science and technology will be prepared.                                                                                                 To understand the nature of science and technology requires that                it be studied from many different perspectives.  Modern \"S&T\" (i.e.             since the 17th century) have been principally a Western phenomena,              but traditionally China has been in the forefront of scientific and             technological development.  To understand how S&T developed in                  China and to understand the differences in its culture which                    retarded the advance of \"modern\" science will greatly enhance our               broader comprehension of how this peculiar human pursuit develops.",
