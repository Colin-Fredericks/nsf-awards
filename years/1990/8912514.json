Poirier, Ohio State University in a National Science                   Foundation dissertation research project with Ms. Shaily A. Menon               an approved PhD candidate at Ohio State University.  The Wildlife               Institute of India at New Forest, Dehra Dun, directed by Dr. H.S.               Panwar, has stated his Institute will collaborate in this research              effort by giving Ms. Menon professional guidance from faculty                   members, assistance in obtaining the necessary permissions                      required in the pursuit of her research and providing library and               computer facilities during the progress of her research.  The                   proposed research is to be conducted in two parts.  The first will              be to test the hypotheses about habitat selection by the                        lion-tailed macaque, Macaca silenus, an endangered species of                                        ______________                                             monkeys.  The second part of the study will use the predicitive                 capabilities of Geographic Information System to suggest                        conservation strategies for a newly established wild-game preserve              in India.  The Wildlife Institute will carry out follow-up                      research and implement wildlife management plans suggested by the               study.                                                                                                                                                          Scope:  This doctoral dissertation research, by a female Indian                 national  in South Indian rain forests with the cooperation of the              premier wildlife organization in India, into the scientific ways                and means to aid, protect an endangered species, has the                        possibilities, if successfully concluded, to overshadow                         difficulties that have traditionally hampered U.S. researchers                  conducting anthropological research in India, in addition to                    possibly providing the basis for further research and management                prospectives toward possibly alleviating the environmental                      conditions that have brought a primate species to be declared                   endangered.  This proposal does meet the objectives of the Science              in Developing Countries Program to provide incremental support to               dissertation improvement research in the furtherance of the                     exchange of scientific knowledge and in making contributions to                 the scientific infrastructure of a developing country.",
