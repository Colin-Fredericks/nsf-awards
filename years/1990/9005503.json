This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department of Mathematics of George Washington                  University: high accuracy multigrid solution of viscous flow                    problems, directed by Murli Gupta; the buckling of elastic                      spherical shells, directed by Frank Baginski; numerical dynamics                of hamiltonians with singularities, directed by  Kevin Hockett;                 the dynamical theory of tilings and quasicrystals, directed by E.               Arthur Robinson; combinatorial statistics, directed by Rodica                   Simion.",
