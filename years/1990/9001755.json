 "awd_abstract_narration": "Myxococcus xanthus development is regulated by the Csg                          intercellular communication system. The C signal appears to be                  the polypeptide product of the csgA gene. The preliminary results               suggest four directions for future work. First, random                          mutagenesis of csgA followed by DNA sequencing of developmental                 mutants is expected to determine the important functional domains               of the protein. Second, examination of the regulation of csgA in                response to moderated levels of nutrients is expected to reveal                 how nutrient levels are assessed in this organism and used to                   regulate gene expression. This project will involve a) random                   mutagenesis and DNA sequencing of the regulatory region to                      identify nucleotides that play a critical role in regulation, b)                cloning of genes encoding regulatory proteins using recognition                 site probes, c) characterization of the protein-DNA interactions                with gel mobility shift assays and DNA foot printing, and d)                    quantitation of the expression levels in vivo using a reporter                  locus. Third, continued analysis of the csgA suppressor mutations               is expected to reveal other steps in the signaling process.                     Several suppressor alleles have been cloned and these will be                   sequenced and studied by other functional assays.                               %%%                                                                             The life cycle of the myxobacterium, Myxococcus xanthus,                        contains the basic elements found in the development of higher                  organisms including directed cell movement, multicellular                       morphogenesis, regulated gene expression and cellular                           differentiation. It can therefore serve as an experimentally                    accessible model for the study of these processes.",
