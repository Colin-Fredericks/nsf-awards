 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed project are to gain fundamental                  understanding of the dynamic, thermal, and chemical structures                  of premixed and nonpremixed flames of chloromethane and                         tetrachloroethylene, and to provide insight into such                           practical issues as flame stabilization, fuel mixing, and                       surrogate selection for incineration of chlorinated                             hydrocarbons.  The investigation will involve laser-based                       measurement of temperature, velocity, and major species in an                   opposed-flow burner over a range of pressures and mixture                       ratios.  The detailed structure will be compared to numerical                   predictions using available chemical kinetics data, and                         asymptotic analysis will be used to derive a reduced                            mechanism.                                                                                                                                                      Incineration is a viable technology for the safe disposal of                    hazardous chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes.  These chemicals,                     however, are more difficult to burn than their unchlorinated                    analogs, they form soot more easily, and trace amounts of                       highly toxic compounds can be generated.  The proposed                          research will increase the knowledge base of the combustion of                  this class of compounds.",
