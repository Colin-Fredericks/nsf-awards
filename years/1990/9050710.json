 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns a new Computer Vision and Image Processing                Laboratory, to support three senior-level courses in Electrical and             Computer Engineering.  Traditionally such courses have been                     available only to graduate students at major universities where the             expense of sophisticated workstations and support equipment can be              borne by externally-funded research projects.  The new laboratory               will occupy dedicated space in the recently renovated Moench Hall               that will be known as the Image Processing and Computer Vision                  Laboratory.  An introductory course entitled \"Principles of Image               Processing\" is already offereed, but without the benefit of a                   laboratory class students are deprived of essential hands-on                    experience.  The equipment will allow students to capture real                  images and to learn some of the operations associated with image                processing (image capture, sampling and quantization, gradient-                 based edge detection, image averaging, and statistical image                    analysis).  They will also be able to appreciate some of the                    difficulties and limitations of computer vision systems at the                  present state of development.  The provision of funds to put this               advanced laboratory in place will add a new dimension to the                    Electrical and Computer Engineering program at Rose-Hulman                      Institute of Technology.  The institution is contributing an amount             equal to the award.***//",
