 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Christina Romer under the National           Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.            The objectives of this program are to provide research support to the           Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.                                                                                                                                                   This award will allow the investigator to pursue her research which             systematically links modern macroeconomics with economic history.               One of her major research accomplishments has been to challenge the             data used to analyze prewar business cycles.  In the 1960s and 1970s,           economists tended to view prewar estimates of such indicators as gross          national product or the unemployment rate as comparable with modern             estimates.  They then used these data to argue that business cycles had         gotten much less severe between the early 20th century and the more             recent era.  Dr. Romer's work directly contradicted this widely                 accepted finding by showing that the prewar estimates of most major             indicators of economic health were constructed in a way that                    accentuated prewar cycles.  When these biases were removed, the new             prewar estimates showed that cycles before and after the Great                  Depression were of roughly equal severity.  Thus, by measuring output           in a consistent way, she found that much of the pre- and post-war               difference was the result of a better data base for measurement in the          latter period.  This finding is important for it overthrows the key             observation used by both monetary economists, e.g., Nobel Laureate              Milton Friedman, and Keynesian economists, e.g., Nobel Laureates James          Tobin and Franco Modigliani, as being strongly supportive of their              respective theories.  Now, she proposes another challenge, this time to         the widely held belief about the macroeconomy that movements in money           cause movements in real output.  This research involves investigating           whether there is in fact an identifiable statistical relationship               between particularly dramatic movements in the supply of money in the           prewar era and the behavior of the real economy and the close                   examination of the historical record to see if the large movements of           money associated with financial panics should be viewed as exogenous            events or as endogenous movements triggered by the early states of a            depression.  Dr. Romer has stimulated a new interest in the evolution           of the American economy and she will continue to be a major contributor         to reinterpretations of it.  While evidence from the past has often             been used to illustrate or illuminate, Dr. Romer's research is                  differentiated by the depth of the historical analysis and its use in           posing relevant hypotheses that have the power to reshape macroeconomic         theory.",
