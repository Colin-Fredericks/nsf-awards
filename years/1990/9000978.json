Library research, field work and                        laboratory investigation will be combined in each project to give               the student a broad range of experience.  The emphasis will be on               independent work by the student under the guidance and in the                   direct field of interest of the research supervisors.  Each                     student will have his or her own research project to work on.                   Each student will present the results of his or her work orally                 and in a formal written report and each will be urged to present                his or her findings at a professional meeting. Research projects                will focus on the geology of the Coastal Plain and Peidmont of                  Virginia.",
