 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most sensational biological phenomena of this                   century has been the rapid spread of the so called \"Africanized\"                or \"Killer bees\" in the Americas.  In the 33 years since their                  establishment as a feral population in southern Brazil, African                 derived bees have colonized all the tropical and subtropical                    regions of South and Central America.  Tropical North America                   (Mexico) is now being colonized and this expanding population                   will reach the United States in 1990.  Arrival of African honey                 bees is followed by rapid build-up of a feral population,                       numerous stinging incidents involving people and animals,                       \"Africanization\" of apiaries with eventual disappearance of                     beeswith traits characteristic of \"native\" European subspecies,                 and a decline in beekeeping and honey production.                                    Movement of feral African bees into areas previously                       dominated by European bees provides a unique opportunity to                     obtain quantitative data on the changes that occur as these two                 genetically distinct populations interact.  This research will                  focus on the population level and within colony processes that                  contribute to genetic changes in managed European and feral                     African populations.  The investigators combine analytical and                  experimental approaches to assess \"Europeanization\" and                         \"Africanization\" by measuring the rates of genetic change with                  the use of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers.  These two                types of genetic information will allow them to establish the                   relative contributions of maternal and paternal gene flow to                    these processes and to determine where selection is acting most                 intensely in the system.  The results of this study will provide                a comprehensive view of the genetic interactions between feral                  and managed honey bee populations.  Information obtained in this                study also will be valuable to decision makers charged with                     development of public policies and methodologies to control                     African bees.",
