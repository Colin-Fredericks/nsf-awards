 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History has been an                    independent institution dedicated to collections and research                   since 1923.  The Museum's Department of Invertebrate Zoology has                grown dramatically during the past decade, and its mollusk                      collection now comprises nearly 200,000 specimen lots and more                  that 1,700 type specimens.  This collection ranks among the                     finest in North America, and is one of the exceptional                          repositories for mollusks in the region.  The collections will be               moving into much larger, newly constructed quarters, and a new                  endowed Curatorship has recently been filled with a mollusk                     specialist.  Dr. Eric Hochberg, Curator of Mollusks, has crafted                a long-range plan for growth and curation of the collection.  The               first phase involves installation of new storage cabinets in the                recently completed collections building.  The cephalopod                        collection that was donated by the Allan Hancock Foundation of                  the University of Southern California will be integrated with the               rest of the collection.                                                              The proposed improvements to the mollusk collection of the                 Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History will establish this                     institution as a growing center for research and curation.                      Researchers in the areas of ecology, biogeography, systematics,                 and evolutionary biology (to name a few) will be given new and                  easy access to important specimen collections.  Natural history                 collections such as this are indispensable resources in the study               of biological diversity.",
