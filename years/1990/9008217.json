 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the development since World War II of                     federal policies to regulate the relationship between home and                  work.  Such policies specify how work organizations are to treat                individuals defined in terms of their family status.  The project               focuses on three aspects of policy development:  the movement of                issues on and off the congressional agenda, the development of                  alternative proposals, and the enactment of legislation.  Factors               affecting policy development will include the concerns of                       experts, media coverage, activities of interest groups and social               movements, and public opinion.  The PI will analyze the contents                of policy proposals, gathered from government documents, reports                in newspapers, specialized journals, and public opinion polls.                  The results will be an analysis of a major policy area, which                   will aid the study of other issue areas.",
