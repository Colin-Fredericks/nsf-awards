 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award enables John Carroll University to improve its                  connection to NSFNET by re-routing and upgrading its connection to              the mid-level network OARnet, the Ohio Academic Resources Network.              Improved access to NSFNET provides John Carroll faculty with                    increased opportunity for collaboration and use of a wide range of              research tools such as supercomputing and shared databases.                          Because of a change in OARnet's network topology, John Carroll             is connecting to the SONIC (State of Ohio Network for Integrated                Communications) Point-of Presence tower in Cleveland.  They also                are changing their protocol to TCP/IP, which is used on OARnet,                 NSFNET and the rest of the INTERNET.  To facilitate the expected                increased use of the network, the bandwidth of the data line from               the school to OARnet is being increased from 9,600 bits per second              to 56,000 bits per second.",
