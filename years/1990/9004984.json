 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chlorosomes are light-harvesting structures attached to the                     inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane in green                              photosynthetic bacteria.  The polypeptide composition of                        Chloroflexus chlorosomes consists of three major protein                        components and a fourth minor polypeptide.  Functional roles                    for all four proteins have been tentatively assigned.  This                     project is aimed at determining the role played by these                        proteins during the development of the photosynthetic                           apparatus.  Recombinant genetic techniques are being used to                    isolate the genes for two major proteins components of the                      chlorosome.  The gene for one chlorosome protein (Mr 5700)                      has already been cloned:  it contains a coding region for a                     carboxyl-terminal extension that is not present on the mature                   protein and which may be important for targetting the protein                   to the appropriate assembly site within the chlorosome.  This                   investigation deals in detail with the genetic structure,                       organization and regulation of genes encoding chlorosome                        proteins.                                                                                                                                                       The green and purple photosynthetic bacteria possess a                          simpler type of photosynthesis than that occurring in higher                    plants.  In these bacteria light is harvested as an energy                      source to support the synthesis of sugars and other organic                     components of the bacteria from atmospheric carbon dioxide,                     but oxygen is not produced.  Because of their relative                          simplicity these bacteria provide useful model systems which                    are often more amenable to detailed analysis than are higher-                   plant systems.  Studies of bacteria have made major                             contributions to the advancement of fundamental knowledge of                    photosynthesis.  Dr. Fuller's investigations provide                            essential information about the structure and function of the                   biological compounds and complex cellular structures that are                   responsible for the useful harvesting of sunlight by green                      bacteria.***//",
