 "awd_abstract_narration": "This laboratory uses an unusual in vivo ultrastructural                       approach, the \"Miller chromatin spreading technique,\" to                        visualize transcriptionally active genes in the electron                        microscope and to analyze the co-transcriptional RNA processing                 events on nascent pre-mRNA transcripts, including                               ribonucleoprotein (RNP) formation, splice site selection,                       constitutive splicing, and alternative splicing.  In order to                   extend observations from the level of ultrastructural                           phenomenology to biochemical identification of specific proteins,               there is a need to be able to identify the proteins at specific                 sites on the transcripts and in specific structures.  The                       technique of immuno-electron microscopy would allow this                        analysis, but has not yet been perfected for use on Miller                      chromatin spreads.  The proposed project will take a systematic                 and logical approach to the development of such a technique.                    Some of the desired monoclonal antibodies are already in hand,                  which will be used in conjunction with colloidal gold markers for               EM visualization.Immediate applications of such a technique                     include localization on nascent RNA of specific snRNPs, specific                hnRNP proteins, general splicing factors, and proteins implicated               in splicing regulation.  The technique would be more generally                  useful, however, and could be used to localize proteins involved                in chromatin structure, replication, transcription regulation,                  attenuation, and polyadenylation to specific sites or structures                on the genetic material.                                                                                                                                        The development of this technique would thus make possible a                    deeper understanding of how proteins interact with DNA and RNA                  to effect and regulate gene expression.",
