 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to Dr. Frank Wolak under the National          Science Foundation's Presidential Young Investigator Awards Program.            The objective of this program is to provide research support to the             Nation's most outstanding and promising young science and engineering           faculty.  The awards are intended to improve the capability of U.S.             academic institutions to respond to the demand for highly qualified             science and engineering personnel for academic and industrial research          and teaching.                                                                                                                                                        This award will allow the investigator to pursue his research in           the areas of theoretical econometrics and industrial organization.  All         of his research is motivated by the desire to link economic theory to           empirical data.  While the role of his methodological work is to                provide better econometric techniques for accomplishing the goal of his         empirical work, the goal of his empirical work is to derive and                 estimate econometric models based on economic theory and then to test           the validity of the economic theory embodied in these models.  It is in         this synergistic fashion that Dr. Wolak intends to focus on integrating         the innovative theoretical work modeling firm and industry behavior             with the empirical realities of the global semiconductor market, public         utility regulation, and the nature of spatial competition among firms           as revealed in the context of U. S. electric utility coal purchases.            In his analysis of the global semiconductor market, special emphasis            will be given to assessing the impact of the increased Japanese                 penetration into this market on the stability of the world and U. S.            markets.  Dr. Wolak's subjection of problems involving inequality               restrictions to rigorous hypothesis testing and his empirical                   implementation of game-theoretic models of firm interaction exemplify           the way in which he brings his unusual set of important skills to bear          on bridging the gap between theory and practice.  Dr. Wolak's work has          been and will continue to be very effective in achieving a more                 rigorous fit between economic theory and empirical data as he                   dynamically draws upon theory to inform data collection and data to             inform the development of theory.",
