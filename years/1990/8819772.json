 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental issue of taste physiology is whether there  are                   specific types of responses in specific nerve fibers, or  whether               there is a continuum of sensitivities across the  population of                 fibers.  This project exploits the remarkable  taste system of                  the catfish, which has taste buds all over  the skin of the body,               to investigate the physiology of taste  responses to particular                 compounds and to particular mixtures.   Electrophysiological                    recording will be used to determine how  amino acid taste                       \"quality\" and quantity (intensity) are  represented in neurons of               the facial nerve, which innervates  the taste buds.  Since in                   real life taste receptors rarely  encounter sequentially spaced                 delivery of single chemicals,  stimuli will include single                      compounds and mixtures, to see  whether, as in invertebrates,                   responses to taste mixtures are  not simply predictable from                    responses to the individual  components.  Recordings also will be               made in the cells of  central pathways that process the taste                   information through  the brainstem and higher gustatory nuclei.                 This unusual  preparation has provided a wealth of fundamental                  information  on taste sensitivity already, and this project will                provide  results that are likely to have high impact on gustatory               research.  This physiology also will complement current  exciting               work on taste biochemistry, and the analyses of  complex stimuli                are likely to be important to sensory science  in general.",
