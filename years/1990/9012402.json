 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this exploratory study is to develop time                   series data on aggregate investments in infratechnology in the                  U.S. and to evaluate the statistical relationship between these                 investments and various indices of technological advancement.  In               general, changes in research and development (R&D) expenditures--               which capture direct investments into the scientific base,                      generic technologies and proprietary technologies--have long been               viewed as an important indicator of the technological health of                 our economy.  The efficiency of conducting R&D, however, depends                heavily on investments in infratechnologies, which consist of                   nonproprietary measurement and test methods, procedures, and data               that support an industry's internal R&D, production and marketing               activities.                                                                          As such, data on aggregate investments in infratechnology                  could represent an important new indicator of the Nation's                      technological advancement.  This project thereby could contribute               to the Foundation's responsibility to provide for the collection                and interpretation of data on scientific and engineering                        resources.",
