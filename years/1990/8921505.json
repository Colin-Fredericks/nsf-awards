 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic Synthesis Program is funding the continuation of                    the research program of Dr. Rick L. Danheiser.  Dr. Danheiser                   will continue his fruitful development of new methods to                        synthesize carbocyclic and heterocyclic compounds containing                    five-membered rings.  This will provide the new tools required                  by the increasingly complex requirements of industry and                        agriculture.                                                                                                                                                    One important aim of the project is the continued development                   of the recently discovered general \u01313+2! annulation strategy.                   In this process an allenylsilane functions as a three-carbon                    annulation unit combining with an electrophilic pi bond to form                 a new five-membered ring.  The extension of this strategy to                    the synthesis of several important classes of five-membered                     ring compounds will be investigated.  Specific targets of                       interest include cyclopentanone derivatives and heterocyclic                    systems such as pyrroles and carbapenems.  Research will also                   be carried out aimed at the development of a general synthesis                  of substituted azulenes.  The azulenes constitute the best                      known class of polycyclic nonbenzenoid aromatic compounds, and                  recently the novel electronic properties and biological                         activity of certain natural and semi-synthetic azulenes have                    led to commercially important applications of these compounds                   in fields such as medicine and electrophotography.  However,                    progress in these areas has been hindered by the availability                   of very few general methods for the synthesis of azulenes,                      particularly substituted systems.  The development of a general                 \u01313+2! annulation route to substituted azulenes will provide                     access to compounds with potential applications as drugs,                       liquid crystal elements, and novel electronic materials.                                                                                                        Another important objective of the project is the development                   of new cyclization methods based on unusually facile pericyclic                 and anionic ring closure reactions of allenes.  Preliminary                     experiments have been carried out that indicate that certain                    allene derivatives undergo efficient cyclization under                          remarkably mild conditions.  A principal aim of the project                     will be the application of this process in a new synthesis of                   substituted indoles.  The indole nucleus is the central                         structural feature in a large array of natural products                         including plant growth regulators and clinically important                      pharmaceuticals.  Relatively few general methods for the                        construction of substituted indoles exist, and the new                          methodology to be investigated will provide improved access to                  a variety of important indole derivatives.",
