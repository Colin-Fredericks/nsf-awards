 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for one-half the cost of acquiring               a time-resolved laser Raman spectrometer system that will be                    installed and operated in the Department of  Geological Sciences                at the University of Washington. The University of Washington is                committed to providing the remaining half required.                                  The instrument system will be used to study the microscopic                mechanism and dynamics of solid-state phase transitions and of                  melting in silicates at temperatures up to 3000K. Localized                     heating of the sample will involve radiation by a continuous-                   power CO2 laser, with the silicate crystals or glass acting as                  its own crucible container.  Intense black-body radiation from                  the sample at high-temperature will be suppressed using a                       synchronous detection technique that involves pulsed-excitation                 and gated-array detection. The sample temperature will be                       determined from Raman intensities by Stokes/antiStokes ratioing                 and by means of a two color optical pyrometer. The high-                        temperature Raman spectra will be interpreted by molecular                      dynamics simulations. The molecular level structures of silicates               at high-temperature are vital data for interpreting the nature of               melting and other phase transitions inside the Earth.",
