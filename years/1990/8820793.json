 "awd_abstract_narration": "A central focus for studies in science, technology and society is               the development and management of complex technologies.  These                  efforts raise correspondingly complex ethical and value concerns                which must be confronted and reconciled in the process.  This                   project addresses key value issues in the transfer of                           biotechnology to developing countries.  The research team --                    composed of U.S. researchers and cooperating scientists from the                developing countries -- will conduct a detailed analysis of two                 cases involving research, development and production of vaccines                in these countries.  Researchers will use interviews, study of                  documents, and observation, to examine whether these projects                   provide examples of viable ways to foster the development of                    independent biotechnology industries in developing countries and                what value considerations enter into the decisions to undertake                 and manage them.  An Advisory Committee will provide project                    oversight and review.  Products are expected to include                         monographs and articles, two masters' theses, sessions at                       meetings of relevant professional societies and at international                conferences, and teaching modules and design exercises for use                  here and overseas.                                                                                                                                              This project addresses an important issue in a unique                           interdisciplinary manner.  The research team, consultants, and                  advisors represent an appropriate mix of disciplines and are                    uniquely qualified to collaborate.  Further effort is likely to                 continue beyond the duration of this award.  The project is                     designed well; university support is good.  An award in the                     amount of $100,267 is therefore recommended.",
