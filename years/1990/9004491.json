 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr.Tamkun's research is focused on the genetic and molecular                    mechanisms controlling the development of Drosophila                            melanogaster.  This proposal concerns a new homeotic gene,                      kismet, identified by virtue of its genetic interactions with                   homeotic mutations.  Genetic studies of the kismet locus have                   suggested that it is a target, or encodes a cofactor, of the                    Antennapedia gene product.  Dr.Tamkun proposes to continue                      concurrent genetic and molecular analyses of kismet to determine                its precise role in the determination of segmental identities                   during development.  This will be accomplished through the use of               germ-line and somatic clonal analyses, the continued                            characterization of genetic interactions between kismet and the                 homeotic loci of the Antennapedia and bithorax complexes, and the               molecular cloning of kismet. Antibodies directed against the                    kismet protein will be generated and used to determine its                      subcellular distribution.  The spatial and temporal expression of               kismet during development will be followed using nucleic acid                   and antibody probes.  The effect of various  homeotic mutations                 on the expression of the kismet mRNA and  protein will be                       examined to determine if this locus is a target  of homeotic gene               regulation.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The determination of body segment identity in fruit flies is an                 excellent system for studying the control of pattern formation in               multicellular organisms. Mutations in one class of genes can                    result in the transformation of one body segment into the                       likeness of another, such as the transformation of an antenna                   into a leg. This work will further our understanding of how this                class of genes functions.",
