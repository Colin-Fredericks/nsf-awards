 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major effort in modern neuroscience has been directed at                      understanding how the brain accomplishes sensory perception.                    Research on the visual system has found that different brain                    regions are specialized for the perception of shape, color,                     motion, and other aspects of the visual world.  Much less is                    understood about the perception of emotional aspects of visual                  stimuli.  It is not clear, for example, how animals or humans are               able to differentiate an angry or threatening facial gesture from               a friendly one.                                                                                                                                                 Monkeys, like humans, are highly visual creatures and use subtle                facial gestures for communication.  Electrophysiological studies                have shown that neurons in the amygdaloid complex respond                       selectively to the presentation of static images of faces.  The                 previous work did not determine whether or not these neurons                    differentiate the emotional content of the facial expressions.                  However, monkeys with lesions of the amygdaloid complex are                     indifferent to positive or negative events and are unable to                    appropriately interpret signals of dominance or submission by                   other monkeys, suggesting that the amygdaloid complex may mediate               the perception of species-specific emotional stimuli.                                                                                                           In Frederick K. Nahm's doctoral-dissertation research, videotapes               of the facial expressions of socially interacting monkeys will be               made.  These images will then be transferred to a digital                       optical-laser-disk system.  Epochs of monkey facial expressions                 will be catalogued and divided into 1-second segments.  Series of               these 1-second dynamic stimuli covering all forms of monkey                     expression will be used as stimuli for electrophysiological                     studies that will survey neuronal responsivity in all portions of               the monkey amygdaloid complex.                                                                                                                                  These studies will contribute to an understanding of the neural                 basis of normal emotional perception and expression in the human                brain.  Moreover, since the amygdaloid complex has the highest                  density of benzodiazepine receptors (through which the                          antianxiety drugs such as librium have their effects), these                    studies will also pave the way to an understanding of anxiety and               inappropriate emotional states such as phobias.",
