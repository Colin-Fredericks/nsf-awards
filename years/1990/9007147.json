 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal novel in situ infrared analysis system is                      sought.  This system will be used by a group of five                            investigators and their students in order to investigate a                      number of research projects in the general area of processing                   of advanced materials.  Several projects in the field of                        reaction and transport processes will benefit from the                          availability of this system.  The kinetics of gel formation                     before and after the gelation point will be studied with FTIR                   using the reaction of multimethacrylates as a model example.                    The kinetics and structure of ceramic gels will be studied                      similarly.  The fundamental properties of GaAs surfaces and                     Langmuir-Blodgett films will be investigated.  Microelectronic                  processing will be studied and the distribution of moisture                     concentration in epoxy networks will be investigated.                           Finally, protein adsorption on polymeric biomaterial will be                    studied using ATR-FTIR.",
