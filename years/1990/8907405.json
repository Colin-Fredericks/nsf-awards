 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hypothesis that canopy lichens, acting as keystone                     species, can control the conservation and retention of nutrients                in forest ecosystems and affect nutrient cycling and primary                    production will be tested.  In blue oak woodlands, a community                  that occupies 6.5% of California, biomass of the lichen, Ramalina               menziesii, can exceed 700 kg/ha in the canopy.  This proposed                   work seeks to demonstrate the importance of this non-nitrogen-                  fixing canopy epiphyte in net primary production and nutrient                   cycling throughout this oak woodland ecosystem.  A replicated                   factorial experiment will be imposed by which canopy lichen and                 lichen litterfall are manipulated at two sites, representing                    different degrees of maritime influence in Monterey County,                     California.  Manipulations of the canopy lichen biomass will test               the hypothesis that Ramalina enhances nutrient inputs from the                  atmosphere.  For instance, the catch of atmospheric aerosols, fog               water and gases by Ramalina may enhance the input of nutrients to               the entire woodland.  Manipulations of the amount of Ramalina                   that is deposited as litterfall will test the hypothesis that the               decomposition of this lichen controls the decomposition and                     cycling of nutrients to the oak trees.  The growth efficiency and               nutrient-use efficiency of the oak trees will also be examined in               the experimental plots.  The investigators will also develop a                  simple technique for extrapolating results to oak woodlands of                  differing density and to considerations at scales ranging to                    regional evaluations.  The results will be significant to                       understanding the role of particular species in the functional                  properties of entire ecosystems, and to the understanding of                    canopy processes to other aspects of ecosystem function in oak                  woodlands. In addition, this study may be viewed as a case study                for any lichen dominated canopy and will have implications for                  the function of epiphytes in general in ecosystems.                                  The research project team is excellent.  Institutional                     accommodations are quite good, and accommodations for the work at               the Hastings Natural History Reservation will be adequate.",
