 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the 1940's Barbara McClintock identified a new type of                  genetic element in corn that she proposed (to the general                       amazement of the genetics community) to move around within the                  genome.  These \"jumping genes\" or transposable elements, as they                have come to be called, have recently been shown to exist in a                  wide variety of organisms and are known to cause mutations in the               DNA at sites where they insert.  As the widespread occurrence of                these transposable elements became apparent, their importance as                a major source of genetic variation, subject to natural or                      artificial selection to produce population change, became an                    issue.                                                                               The particular aspect of this problem addressed by this                    project is whether the response to artificial selection for a                   quantitative trait (an inherited trait controlled by many genes                 and influenced by environmental factors as well) differs between                populations that are genetically identical except for the                       presence of a particular transposable element.  The hypothesis                  is that mutations caused by the transposable element in genes                   that affect the quantitative trait might serve as an additional                 source of usable variation, allowing a greater response to                      selection to occur in populations containing the element.",
