 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project is for support of U.S.                               participation in the International Conference on Advances                       in Structural Testing, Analysis and Design, scheduled for                       July 29-August 3, 1990 in Bangalore, India.  The                                conference aims to bring together scientists, engineers                         and designers of modern structures to review perceptions                        for synthesis and integration of design, analysis and                           testing.  Topics will include:  composite structures,                           fatigue and fracture mechanics, CAD/CAM/CAE, expert                             systems and artificial intelligence, finite                                     element/boundary element methods, experimental stress                           analysis, non destructive testing, static and  dynamic                          testing, structural dynamics and model analysis,                                aeroelasticity and structure-control interactions,                              fluid-solid interaction and non-linear mechanics.  The                          proceedings are expected to be published by McGraw Hill                         by the conference dates.  Participants are expected from                        the major West European countries, the USSR, China, Japan                       and Australia as well as the U.S. and India.                                                                                                                    Scope:  The meeting is expected to be one of the main                           conferences in the field in India with a broad scope                            covering many areas of interest to civil, mechanical and                        aeronautical engineers, and to scientists in mathematics,                       artificial intelligence, computer applications and in                           materials science.  The wide participation from major                           countries of Europe, Japan, Australia as well as the U.S.                       and India provide for an important forum for exchange of                        information and for increasing collaboration.",
