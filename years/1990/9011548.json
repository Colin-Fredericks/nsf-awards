 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the analysis of nonlinear hyperbolic               partial differential equations, with applications to wave                       propagation in a variety of physical contexts.  The analysis is                 based on the systematic reduction of complex systems of equations               to simpler model equations by means of asymptotic equations.                    The model equations are studied using a combination of explicit                 solutions, perturbation methods, qualitative analysis, and                      numerical calculations.                                                              The research lies in the general area of applied                           mathematics.  Physical systems in which disturbances propagate at               finite speeds are often modelled by hyperbolic partial                          differential equations.  Examples include compressible gas flows,               elasticity, magnetohydrodynamics, and general relativity.  When                 the speed of the disturbance depends on the strength of the                     disturbance, the equations are nonlinear.  An outstanding                       property of nonlinear hyperbolic waves is the formation of                      shocks.  Shock waves are of significant practical importance                    (e.g. in sonic booms or the nonsurgical destruction of kidney                   stones) and pose many challenging mathematical problems.",
