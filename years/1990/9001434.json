 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past few decades observed increases in                          atmospheric concentrations of certain trace species (eg. CO2, O3,               CH4, etc.) have resulted in a growing awareness of man's                        potential to perturb his environment on a global scale.                         Consequently, this decade has seen increased efforts to identify                and understand the properties of the remote atmosphere and the                  processes relating the sources, transformations and removal of                  the constituents that are present.  This kind of investigation                  involves measurement of the particle and gas phase species of                   interest in conjunction with the environmental and meteorological               parameters known to influence their behavior.  Understanding                    these processes is essential to assessing the importance of                     various issues of current environmental concern.  These include                 1) the role of clouds on climate, 2) the role of aerosol and                    gases in atmospheric radiative transfer and 3) the geochemical                  cycling of atmospheric constituents.  Any investigation of these                issues requires a knowledge of the relative influence of                        anthropogenic, \"natural\" continental and marine contributions.                       This research project will support the analysis of data                    collected from:  1) the recent Central Pacific Atmospheric                      Comparison Experiment (CPACE) aboard the NCAR-Electra aircraft                  was intended to intercompare and evaluate recently developed                    techniques for measuring gas and aerosol species at low                         concentrations.  Size-resolved aerosol information will be                      combined with the measurements of other CPACE investigators for                 the characterization of our atmospheric observations and to                     complete the proposed evaluation of aerosol inlet losses;  and                  2) measurements of aerosol physicochemistry and optical                         properties during five equatorial transects currently obtained as               part of the Soviet-American Gas and Aerosol Experiment Three                    (SAGA III) the equatorial Pacific between Hawaii and Samoa in                   spring of 1990.",
