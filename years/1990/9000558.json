 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturers of discrete products have not yet made full use of                the power of the computer to improve their performance. In                      particular, most manufacturers use linear process plans that are                based upon the planner's estimate of which machine will be \"the                 best\" at the time when the work pieces are produced. This imposes               unnecessary constraints on the process plan and the machine type                choice is made without current knowledge of the system's status.                Both have the potential to reduce the system                                    efficiency/effectiveness by restricting the system manager's                    domain of alternatives for dispatching and processing the                       workload (scheduling and control).                                                                                                                              The long term goal of Technology Constrained Process Planning                   (TCOPP) is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of                       discrete manufacturing through improved processing planning,                    scheduling, and control. This will be accomplished through 1) the               specification of process plans as directed graphs, based upon                   technological constraints; and 2) functional specification of the               process plan, rather than a specific class of work station. The                 result will be an increase in the degrees of freedom available                  for scheduling and controlling the production of the workload.                  Resource assignments will be based upon current system status.                  The expanded domain of alternatives and use of current system                   status can reasonably be expected to improve decision making and                system efficiency/effectiveness.",
