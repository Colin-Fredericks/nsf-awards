 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this PYI research is on achieving a fundamental                    understanding of thin films and Interfacial Transport by                        utilization of state-of-the-art NMR techniques.  Several                        diverse areas of focus are:                                                                                                                                     Hydrogen in SiO2 Thin Films and at Si/SiO2 Interfaces - The use                 of < 100 A thick films and lower growth temperatures in                         integrated circuit manufacture leads to increased hydrogen                      incorporation.  In SiO2 films, hydrogen is proposed to                          pasivate electrical defects, modify oxidation kinetics, and                     alter film properties.                                                                                                                                          Crystalline Diamond Thin Films - Improved understanding of                      diamond nucleation and growth is needed in order to deposit                     single crystalline films over large areas, as desired for                       semiconductor applications.                                                                                                                                     Photoresist Thin Films - Efforts to optimize and control                        microlithographic processes are influenced by the density                       variations and motion in polymeric photoresist films.                                                                                                           Proteins Near Charge Interfaces - Transport across biological                   membranes and several bioseparation and biocatalysis                            techniques involve proteins near charged interfaces.  Changes                   in tertiary protein structure induced by thorough preferential                  interaction with charged and polar protein segments can be                      observed directly with NMR.  Reversed micelles, having few                      chemical components and large surface areas, provide a                          relatively simple system for initial study.                                                                                                                     A fundamental understanding of thin films and interfaces is a                   crucial components of process optimization in the                               microelectronics and biotechnology industries.  Unique and                      valuable information is elucidated through the application of                   selected nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to study                   the atomic scale structure of thin films and interfaces.  This                  knowledge can be used to develop and test atomistic models of                   film growth and interfacial chemistry, with the ultimate goal                   of tailoring chemical processes for desired application.",
