 "awd_abstract_narration": "A recently published isotopic study of the precaldera rhyolites                 of Glass Mountain, Long Valley, has shown that the timing of                    differentiation of rhyolitic magma can be determined from Rb-Sr                 dating and resolved from the age of eruption (as determined by K-               Ar ages).  Furthermore, the differences are difficult to explain                unless the rhyolitic magmas persisted in the upper reaches of the               chamber in stable, stratified zones for long periods, of the                    order of 105 to 106 years, with negligible mass transfer between                the different layers.  Such protracted residence periods are                    considerably in excess of the estimates implied by recently                     published thermal modelling of the longevity of high-level                      silicic magma chambers.  This project is to extend this research                to a comprehensive study of the mineral-glass Rb-Sr systematics                 and 40Ar-39Ar ages of the Glass mountain rhyolites and to develop               similar research on other young silicic systems.  The additional                volcanic centers which have been selected are Coso (California),                Mineral Mountains, Twin Peaks and Honeycomb Hills (Utah), La                    Primavera (Mexican Volcanic Belt) and Naivasha (Kenya).  These                  particular volcanic centers were chosen because they contain                    pristine rhyolitic glasses ranging in composition from                          metaluminous to highly peralkaline with high Rb/Sr ratios, and                  have already been well characterized in terms of field relations,               age, chemistry and petrography.",
