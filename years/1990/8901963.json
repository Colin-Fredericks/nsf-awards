 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in bacterial                           genetics to be carried out by James Hoch of the                                 Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla,                             California and Diego de Mendoza of the Department of                            Microbiology at the National University of Rosario,                             Argentina.  The research goal is to develop an in-vivo                          method of cloning Gram-positive organisms in general                            and in particular, Bacillus subtilis.  This procedure                           will eliminate the problems and artifacts involved in                           present methods which require Gram-negative hosts for                           the production of recombinant vectors.                                                                                                                          This research will bring together two laboratories                              which have differing expertise to produce a new                                 generation of genetic technology for Gram-positive                              organisms.  Dr. de Mendoza spent from 1980 to 1983 as                           a postdoc at the University of Illinois and since then                          has been developing in-vivo cloning vectors derived                             from bacteriophages.  Such cloning can be accomplished                          without expensive and difficult to obtain enzymes and                           biologicals as used in in-vitro construction of                                 recombinant DNA vectors.  In addition he has performed                          genetic and biochemical studies of lipid metabolism in                          B. subtilis.  Dr. Hoch is a geneticist whose                                    laboratory has cloned and sequenced a large number of                           B. subtilis genes and has constructed the first                                 library of B. subtilis DNA.  The technology developed                           in this work by two scientists whose expertise is                               complementary will be applicable to other                                       Gram-positive organisms including the Streptococcus                             species important for the production of milk products                           and cheese.  For both the scientific reasons and such                           applications, this work will have a world wide                                  benefit.",
