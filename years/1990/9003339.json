 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the mechanisms involved in the                     development of pattern and form in embryology.  This is to                      develop and analyze mathematical models for generating specific                 patterns and appendages on the integument, specifically alligator               stripe patterns, feather and scale primordia and primate                        fingerprints.  The models are constructed around known biological               facts and close contact will be maintained with experimental                    collaborators.                                                                       The nonlinear partial differential equation systems which                  constitute the models will be investigated analytically and                     numerically.  The mathematical techniques used will primarily be                linear analysis, nonlinear bifurcation theory and numerical                     simulation.  Development of appropriate graphical presentation of               the patterned solutions of the equations will play an important                 part.  The results and biological predictions will be compared                  with the biological data and hopefully will be used to motivate                 specific experiments to try and elucidate the real patterning                   process.  Much of the research is closely linked to specific                    experimental studies currently underway.  The work emphasizes the               need for integrating theoretical studies with experimental and                  observational facts.",
