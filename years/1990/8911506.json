 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous work has shown that many complete t haplotypes and                     many haplotypes in wild mice are combinations of t-specific and                 wild-type alleles.  These exceptional alleles were confined to                  the distal portion of the t complex, suggesting that the nature                 of the chromosomal rearrangements and therefore the                             consequences of recombination differ between the proximal and                   distal portions of the complex.  The first goal of the proposed                 studies involves testing several aspects of a hypothesis                        proposed to account for the origin and evolution of the to                      complex, by estimating the relative ages of the proximal and                    distal portions of the complete t haplotypes, mosaic haplotypes                 and their wild-type homologues through restriction fragment                     and sequence analysis of selected alleles, testing whether                      exceptional loci are confined to the distal portion of the t                    complex, characterizing partial t haplotypes in wild mice,                      identifying the boundaries of the recombination events leading                  to mosaic haplotypes, and estimating rates of gene flow and                     introgression between subspecies of Mus in Europe.  The second                  goal involves a gene mapping test of the hypothesis that there                  is more than one tail interaction (tct) locus within the t                      complex and molecular analysis of a 35kb segment where one of                   the tct loci is presumably located.                                                                                                                             The t complex in house mice offers unique opportunities for                     studying the origin and evolution of gene complexes, especially                 those that act as genetic parasites by preferentially                           transmitting themselves to the presumed detriment of the host.",
