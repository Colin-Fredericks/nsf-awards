It is being funded under the                           Instrumentation and Laboratory Improvement (ILI) Program, which                 has the goal of supporting projects to develop new or improved                  instrument-based undergraduate laboratory courses in science,                   mathematics, or engineering.  The Instrumentation and Laboratory                Improvement Program provides matching support for the                           instrumentation necessary to implement undergraduate                            instructional improvements at U.S. colleges and universities.                        In particular, the main objectives of this project are (1)                 to make computer-assisted delivery of course content an integral                part of the teaching mode, (2) to promote the discovery of                      mathematical concepts by students through hands-on computer                     laboratory experiments and to reinforce basic concepts through                  courseware, and (3) to assign individualized projects to each                   student in the student's major field in order to enhance the                    symbiotic relationship between mathematics and its applications.                The initial focus of this effort will be in courses in numerical                analysis and linear algebra, with more advanced courses to be                   affected later.",
