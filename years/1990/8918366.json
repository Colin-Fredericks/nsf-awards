 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dioecy, the occurrence of separate female (pistillate) and                 male (staminate) plants in a species, has evolved in about 15% of                                                                                               the world's flowering plants.  Schiedea and Alsinidendron of the                                                                                                carnation family (Caryophyllaceae) provide an excellent                         opportunity to study the evolution of dioecy on the Hawaiian                    Islands.  Eight of the 22 species of Schiedea show varying stages                                                                                               in the evolution of dioecy (collectively these breeding systems                 are termed diclinous).  The apparently high frequency of dicliny                                                                                                on remote oceanic islands has been used to support several                      contrasting hypotheses about the evolution of dioecy.                           Distributional data alone are difficult to decide the matter,                   without knowing whether dicliny has evolved in situ on the                      islands and whether it has evolved multiple times there.  Drs.                  Weller and Sakai of the University of California at Irvine will                 study evolutionary relationships in these two genera using                      morphological, chromosomal, and molecular data.  The use of DNA                 analyses to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships will provide                 an independent assessment uncomplicated by convergent evolution                 of floral morphology that may be associated with breeding                       systems.                                                                             A phylogeny of Schiedea and Alsinidendron will increase                    understanding of the basic evolutionary forces associated with                  adaptive radiation in these diverse genera and help in                          interpreting novel features found in the group, including                       specialized floral nectaries, vines, and fleshy fruiting                        structures.  Information on the evolution of dicliny is also of                 general interest because of the potential importance of these                   breeding systems in crop species.  A number of species of                       Schiedea and Alsinidendron are believed extinct in Hawaii, and                  the information obtained in this research will be useful for                    interpreting relationships among breeding systems, rarity, and                  the likelihood of extinction in plants.",
