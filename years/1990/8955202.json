 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project of Southern Illinois University's                    Colleges of Science and Education with the surrounding school                   districts, is designed to increase both the amount and the                      quality of science education in southern Illinois elementary                    schools.  It will provide summer teacher training and a                         variety of follow-up activities during the school year, and                     ongoing support from the university scientists.  For the                        inservice training, two options will be available to the                        teachers.  The first option will be a five week course, which                   includes a two-week practicum; the second option will be a                      more condensed two week course.  The five-week course will                      involve thirty teachers each summer for three summers, and                      the two week course will involve thirty teacher each summer                     for the last two summers of the grant.  Teachers involved in                    the more extensive course will act as mentors for the                           teachers involved in the shorter program. The inservice will                    focus on techniques of promoting active learning through                        experimentation and on the processes and concepts of science                    in order to foster teachers' competence and confidence in                       their ability to teach these subjects.  During the summer                       laboratory component teachers will work with small groups of                    children using a process-oriented science curriculum.  At the                   same time, parent volunteers will be trained to assist these                    teachers during the school year with the teaching of their                      new science program and to support their efforts in the                         community.  This project will, therefore, be developing a                       model for how scientists working with the education faculty                     of their university and with school system administrators,                      teachers, and parents can have a major impact on the teaching                   of science at the elementary school level.  The cost sharing                    will be 54% of the NSF portion.",
