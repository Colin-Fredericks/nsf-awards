 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acquired immunity to Leishmaniasis is cell mediated (CMI)                       (4.5).  Two subpopulation of CD4+T cells determine the                          outcome of disease by Leishmania infection.  Cure in                            genetically resistant mice and immunity in vaccinated                           susceptible BALB/c H-2K mice correlates with the presence                       of a high frequency of Thy2+ CD4+T cell subsets (6.9).                                                                                                          These observations raise the following questions:  (i)                          What T cell epitopes are involved in the activation of                          protective versus disease promoting TH subsets?, and, (ii)                      What are the properties of the different T cell epitopes?,                      and, (iii) How do these epitopes influence the interaction                      of the MHC (Ia) molecule with the TCRa/B in order to                            selectively activate a TH subset?                                                                                                                               The above questions are amenable to investigation using                         Leishmania antigens.  This is because, there are candidate                      Leishmania strain and stage specific antigens that either                       induce protective immunity or exacerbate disease by                             selectively activating a specific subset of primed TH                           cells (7,10,14).  Therefore, we propose that the                                expression of the antigens is regulated in a stage and                          strain specific manner.  The identification of these                            antigens and their genes from stage and strain specific                         cDNA library is possible.  Sequence information and T cell                      proliferative assay would lead to the identification  of                        the T cell epitopes.  The presence of a relevant animal                         model, with a wealth of immunological information will                          facilitate the establishment of the relationship between                        antigen structure and function in vivo.",
