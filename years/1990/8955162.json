 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two outstanding features of this project are its emphasis                   on a hands-on investigative approach to elementary science                      instruction and its commitment to addressing the needs for                      effective science education of underrepresented and                             underserved groups in the Cincinnati Public School System.                      Thirty leadership teachers will receive extensive educational                   experiences during the first year of the project and will                       support the school system's efforts to identify new                             instructional material for the elementary science program.                      Seventy-two underprepared or less well-prepared teachers will                   participate each year following the first year for a total of                   246 participants.  This will allow the school system to have                    teachers with special experiences in elementary science                         instruction in each of the city's elementary schools.  All                      workshops and seminars will provide teachers with in-depth                      experience with concepts and processes in the biological,                       physical, environmental, and earth sciences.  As the                            participants' familiarity with science concepts and process                     increases, they should become more comfortable with the                         subject matter and increasingly confident in their abilities                    to support their fellow teachers as they implement the new                      hands-on science curriculum.   The cost sharing will be 95%                     of the NSF portion.",
