 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pitzer College is creating a series of five three-week long                     experimental investigations in the Human Physiology course, and is              supporting undergraduate research projects in Psychobiology. The                physiology lab  consists of open-ended experimental investigations on           the nervous system, including membrane potentials, synaptic                     transmission, neural integration in motor control, processing of visual         information, and a human electroencephalogram. Students make their own          electrodes with a microelectrode puller, and use computer interfaced            instruments to record and analyze data. These challenging exercises             encourage exploration and help students gain a greater appreciation for         physiology as an experimental scinece. They will also be better                 prepared for senior thesis research work, which is required at the              college. The equipment used previously in the physiology course will            now be used in the introductory biology laboratory, thus benefitting            the beginning students with experimental exercises. The college will            contribute an amount equal to the award.",
