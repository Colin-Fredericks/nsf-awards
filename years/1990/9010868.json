 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can be used to monitor the                formation of coatings at solution-metal interfaces, the                         adsorption of species from solution onto polymer supports, and                  solvation and ion-exchange reactions in polymer thin films.  The                choice of polymer coating and film architecture are crucial to                  the design of QCM-based sensors for analytical applications.  The               apparatus will be constructed and exploratory research will                     begin.  The first objective of the proposed research is to                      establish boundary conditions for designing polymer-coated quartz               crystals for QCM-based sensors.  The second objective is to                     determine the applicability of the QCM for obtaining fundamental                insights into polymer adsorption kinetics and polymer adlayer                   structure.   It will be determined whether the QCM can be used to               measure the microviscosity of polymers at the polymer-metal                     interface, whether the QCM can be used to monitor swelling or ion               transport in non-rigid polymer films, and whether the device can                be used to monitor polymer adsorption directly.  This is a Career               Advancement Award under the Research Opportunity for Women                      Program.",
