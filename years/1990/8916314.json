 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with how organisms learn.  The                        mechanisms uncovered by this work should have applications to                   education and methods for job training, aid in the design of                    artificially intelligent systems, and guide research on the                     neurobiological basis for learning.                                                                                                                             Theorists have distinguished three kinds of learning: supervised,               unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  This project deals                   with learning through reinforcement, which is one of the most                   widely observed types of learning in people and animals.                        Reinforcement has both short-term and long-term effects. The                    tendency to repeat a rewarded action is a short-term effect.  The               tendency to seek out situations that have been associated with                  reward in the past is a long-term effect.  The previous phase of                this project focused on short-term effects.  This phase focuses                 on long-term effects: how memory affects choice.                                                                                                                Dr. Staddon is looking at this problem in two kinds of situation:               a simple choice situation in which hungry animals repeatedly                    choose between two probabilistically rewarded                                   alternatives, and situations in which rewards occur at                          predictable time intervals.  The former situation allows                        researchers to study how the animal's reward history (over a                    period of days) determines its present choice performance; the                  latter situation allows researchers to study how the recent                     distribution of rewards in time (over a period of seconds and                   minutes) affects current behavior.                                                                                                                              By repeated construction and testing of theoretical models for                  learning and memory, Dr. Staddon hopes to arrive at a real-time                 theory of the learning process that will make contact with its                  neurophysiological basis.",
