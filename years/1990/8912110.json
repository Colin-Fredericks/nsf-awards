 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Marine Environmental Sciences Consortium (MESC) is Alabama's                maine science research and education center.  Founded in 1971,                  MESC includes 21 colleges and universities and is part of the                   state's system of higher education.  Teaching and research                      activities of the MESC take place principally at the Dauphin                    Island Sea Lab (DISL), a 36 acre campus located on Dauphin                      Island, 30 miles south of Mobile, Alabama.  Here resident MESC                  faculty, scientists from MESC member schools and visiting                       investigators carry out individual and cooperative research                     efforts.  Research activities at the MESC are currently centered                on understanding  (1) the relative importance of salt marsh,                    seagrass and unvegetated bottom habitats to the production of                   fishes and invertebrates in nearshore waters in the northern Gulf               of Mexico, and on  (2) exchanges of energy between estuaries and                the open Gulf waters, with special attention given to                           understanding the influence of estuarine waters on the                          productivity of offshore \"hard bottom\" fishing grounds.                                                                                                         To further enhance the growing research program at the MESC and                 to stimulate additional interactions with visiting scientists,                  this project provides funds for the purchase of a                               Carbon/Nitrogen/Sulfur (CNS) analyzer, a high-speed refrigerated                centrifuge, and high capacity ultra-low temperature freezer.                    These items are essential to the continued growth of the                        process-oriented component of the MESC research program.  The CNS               analyzer is indispensable for measuring the total carbon,                       nitrogen and sulfur composition of particulate organic matter.                  The addition of CNS capabilities will facilitate the development                of projects aimed at understanding the relative importance of                   natural inorganic and organic nutrient additions to estuaries                   compared with those caused by man's activities.  The addition of                the refrigerated centrifuge and ultra-low freezer will make                     possible several pending research projects designed to examine                  chemically-mediated responses during larval recruitment and                     feeding in estuarine and near-coastal environments.",
