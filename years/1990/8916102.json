 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite their ubiquity in present-day deserts and coastal                       regions, and despite their importance in the geological record                  and for the understanding of modern transport processes, no                     general theory exists for the complex interactions of wind and                  sand responsible for the formation of eolian ripples, and for the               associated micro-stratigraphy.  We propose to study this smallest               class of eolian bedforms through simulations that directly extend               prior analytical work.  Ripples will be followed from birth to                  their mature, finite amplitude state, where the dispersion of                   velocities among waves forces interactions between ripples that                 result in the growth of the mean wavelength and decay of its                    standard deviation through time.  Multiple grainsize systems will               be addressed after an understanding of the monodisperse system is               obtained.  The resulting micro-stratigraphy will be tracked as it               develops.  Ripples will be modeled by cellular automation methods               that have been shown to produce realistic bedform shapes and                    motion, and that physically mimic the motion of grains in actual                ripples.  The saltation impact events that drive ripple dynamics                will be studied by simulation of individual impacts as well as by               comparison with data on saltation collisions collected using                    high-speed photographic techniques.  This latter work is being                  carried out at the University of Aberdeen by Dr. B.B. Willetts,                 with whom we have a N.A.T.O. travel collaboration grant.                        Additional constraints on the nature of ripple fields, both as                  they evolve and at steady state, will be derived using newly                    developed photographic techniques both in the wind tunnel and in                local dunefields in southern California.  Both the methods and                  the results of the proposed research should have a salutary                     effect upon the general field of sediment transport, including                  subaqueous systems.",
