The Clearinghouse will be                                          administered by the National Information                                        Service for Earthquake Engineering (NISEE)                                      whose objective is to disseminate information                                   on earthquake engineering and allied fields to                                  professional users and the general public.                                      The NISEE program at the University of                                          California, Berkeley, includes the EERC                                         Library, Earthquake engineering Abstracts and                                   Computer Applications.  Each unit has a role                                    in establishing a Clearinghouse.  Material                                      from the earthquake will be collected, indexed                                  in the NISEE database and through library                                       resource sharing utilities, publicized at                                       conferences, in publications and through a                                      printed catalog.                                                                                                                                                Strong motion data will be analyzed for energy                                  input and inelastic response spectra.  Since                                    buildings and other structures are often                                        designed to respond inelastically when                                          subjected to an earthquake, these data will                                     provide valuable feedback on the response of                                    buildings during the event.                                                                                                                                     This project will archive the valuable data                                     base of this important event and provide                                        central clearinghouse services to researchers                                   and other users worldwide.",
