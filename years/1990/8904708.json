 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study is intended to further understanding of the                  importance of translational rate to gene expression.  Synonomous                codons are used with greatly unequal frequencies.  The assay                    described herein has been used to measure translational rates                   for 29 sense codons.  Translational rates cover a 25.fold range                 and rate correlates with codon frequency.  Differences in rate                  are caused by differences both of tRNA concentrations and rate                  constants for tRNA selection.  Other work shows that activities                 of individual codons can be modified by the surrounding message                 nucleotides (context).  A lacZ allele is engineered such that                   expression depends on the rate of translation of a single codon.                Site.directed mutagenesis will be used to systematically vary the               critical codon so that the relative rates of tRNA selection canbe               measured for every codon at the same message site in living                     E.coli.  Further, the message context of selected codons will be                systematically altered to determine the effects of message                      context on translational rate.  It explain how biased codon usage               and message context affect translational efficiency.  The                       process by which the information encoded in a gene is decoded                   into a finished protein product involves a number of steps, among               them transcription, in which a messenger RNA is made from the                   gene, and translation, in which the sequence of bases in the                    messenger RNA is converted, in accordance with rules of the                     genetic code,into a sequence of amino acids, which is then                      assembled into protein.  For life to proceed, it is obviously                   essential that the rate of error (i.e., choice of an incorrect                  base or amino acid) be kept extremely low.  The mechanisms by                   which the error rates are kept as low as they are only partly                   understood.  The work proposed herein will elucidate some of                    these mechanisms.",
