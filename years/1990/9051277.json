 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing technology offers the science disciplines the opportunity to          extend laboratory experiences to all areas of their curriculum. In              economics, one or two courses in econometrics, set apart from the               theory courses, serve this purpose. Students are presented with                 statistical theory and are then asked to reinforce the theory by                practising statistical and computing techniques. They are so involved           with connecting the statistical theory to the techniques that they              seldom make the further connection to the economic theory presented in          other classes. An economics computing laboratory is being set up at             Macalester College to unite the practise and theory of econometrics,            and serve as a model for other economic theory courses. This facility,          equipped with a network of Macintosh computers, enables students to             focus on the interpretation of the econometric study. Instead of                concentrating on computing skills and statistical techniques, students          can participate in research projects using facilities in the lab as             well as through the campus network. The college will contribute an              amount equal to the award.",
