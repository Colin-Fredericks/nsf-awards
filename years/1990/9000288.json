 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this U.S.-Poland research project                      between Dr. John S. Dahler of the University of Minnesota and                   Dr. Andrzej Ziabicki of the Polish Academy of Sciences'                         Institute of Fundamental Technological Research is to develop                   theory for various aspects of the physics of polymeric                          systems.  Four areas will be emphasized:  1)  Statistical                       theories of polymeric networks, 2) Statistical physics of                       liquid crystals,  3) Theoretical rheology of non-Newtonian                      fluids, and 4) Dynamics and diffusion of polymers and                           macromolecules.  Results should yield new information on the                    relationships between macroscopic elastic properties and                        microscopic forces that bind polymer beads.  Further,                           insights should be gained on the influence of factors such as                   electric and magnetic fields.  In the course of their work,                     the researchers intend to extend the theory of rod polymers                     to solutions of rods equipped with permanent magnetic                           moments, and they hope to improve existing theories on polymer                  dynamics.                                                                                                                                                       This project in polymers research fulfills the program                          objectives of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                        leading experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to                      combine complementary talents and pool research resources in                    areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
