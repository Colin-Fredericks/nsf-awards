 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the last major frontiers in understanding how plants function            deals with their roots.  The roots benefit a plant by obtaining water           and nutrients from the soil and at the same time they impose a cost on          the plant, which can most readily be appreciated by considering the             carbon incorporated into their structure as well as expended by                 respiration for their growth and maintenance.  Thus, the overall                objective of the research is to determine the carbon requirements of            water acquisition for the root systems of Agave deserti (an agave               native to the southwest of the U.S.), Ferocactus acanthodes (a cactus           sympatric with A. deserti), and Opuntia ficus-indica (a cactus that is          cultivated worldwide as a vegetable, for cattle fodder, and for its             fruits).                                                                                                                                                        The responses of the shoots of the three species to environmental               conditions have been extensively studied in Dr. Nobel's laboratory over         the past 15 years, providing valuable ecological information and also           demonstrating that the productivity of O. ficus-indica exceeds that of          most conventional agronomic crops.  Moreover, the high productivities           of such desert succulents are achieved at a very low cost in terms of           transpired water, because all three species employ Crassulacean acid            metabolism with its nocturnal stomatal opening and a greatly enhanced           water-use efficiency.  Here, the influences of temperature, soil water          status, soil gas phase, and root age on root respiration and water-             uptake ability will be determined for individual roots as well as               entire root systems for A. deserti, F. acanthodes, and O. ficus-indica.         The mechanisms for preventing water loss from the roots to a dry soil           will be examined, a feature that is crucial for the survival of                 perennial plants in deserts.  Performing cost/benefit analyses on the           roots of these highly successful and productive species will not only           provide basic information on how they respond in the natural                    environment but also can be used to propose new land-use scenarios for          the beneficial exploitation of succulent plants under future climatic           conditions.",
