 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the important challenges facing physicists and                      astronomers in the next decade is the direct detection of                       gravitation waves (GW's).  Most of the experimental effort in                   the last twenty years has been directed at developing detectors                 which are sensitive to the millisecond bursts of radiation                      expected to accompany the gravitational collapse of stellar                     objects.                                                                             A useful benchmark with which to compare limits on a                       stochastic background is the closure density of the universe.                   The existence of a background with an energy density much                       larger than this would conflict with current limits on the                      deceleration parameter.  The limits implied by pulsar timing                    and microwave background isotropy are both several orders of                    magnitude below closure density per octave.  Limits on a                        millihertz stochastic background derived from terrestrial                       seismic observations are much higher, several times closure                     density per octave; however, using the earth as a GW detector                   has the advantage of providing discrimination against intrinsic                 fluctuations in the detector.  This is virtually impossible for                 the above two methods.                                                               Under a previous NSF grant Prof. Boughn analyzed more than                 100 station-years of data collected by the Project IDA global                   network of seismometers in order to look for anomalous                          excitation of the low frequency quadrupole modes of the earth                   by a stochastic background of gravitational radiation.  The                     absence of an average excitation of the oS2 and 4S2 modes                       allowed him to set upper limits on a background of                              gravitational waves at 0.31 mHz and 1.72 mHz of a few times the                 critical density of the universe per octave which is several                    orders of magnitude lower than previous limits.  Under this                     award, he would search for pulse excitation of the oS2 modes by                 analyzing the data of the quietest IDA stations during periods                  of low seismic background noise.  The sensitivity limit which                   is imposed by background seismic noise corresponds to a                         dimensionless strain amplitude of h < 10-13.  In order to                       evaluate the ultimate usefulness of the earth as a                              gravitational wave detector he will compute the expected                        excitation of the oS2 mode by terrestrial sources.",
