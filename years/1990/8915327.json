 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growth, a fundamental process of all cells, is mediated by a specific           interaction between a hormone and its receptor at a specific cellular           address.  In plants, growth is mediated by the specific interaction of          the growth-promoting hormone, auxin, and the auxin receptor, however,           there is now substantial evidence, although it is still indirect, that          the auxin receptor and its gene has been identified.  There are several         unique features of this receptor, the most important is that most of it         is found sequestered in a cellular compartment.  No other growth                hormone receptor shares this properties and it raises the question of           the mechanism by which this receptor perceives hormone on the outside           of the cell and mediates growth.                                                                                                                                The following questions are addressed in this proposal: Where in the            tissue and cell is the auxin receptor located and does this location            change during cell development?  Where is the cellular site of auxin            perception by the auxin receptor and is this different than the                 location of the bulk of the receptor population?  Does the presence of          the receptor correlate with auxin-induced growth capacity?                                                                                                      In many instances, growth in plants is limited by the abundance of the          auxin receptor.  An understanding of how this limitation is regulated           in the plant will lend insight into how mankind can manipulate plant            growth and crop yields.",
