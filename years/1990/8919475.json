Certain aspects of the LP model                require reassessment, such as the representation of lexical                     phonological domains, the relation between derivational                         morphology and lexical entries, the relation between inflectional               morphology and syntax, the segregation of certain characteristics               within the lexical or postlexical components, and predictions                   concerning historical change.  This reassessment is best achieved               by bringing together the researchers in phonology and morphology                who have advanced and challenged various portions of the model in               recent years.  These researchers are scattered around North                     America and Europe and do not meet regularly to discuss and                     assess each other's work.  This workshop should bring the field                 to a new consensus concerning the state of the theory of Lexical                Phonology.                                                                                                                                                      The results of the workshop will be released in a publication of                the proceedings.  The venue for publication may be either a                     special edition of a journal such as Phonology (Prof. Kaisse is a               co-editor of this journal), an anthology in a Foris series (e.g.,               'Publications in Language Sciences' or 'Linguistics Models'), or                a volume in the University of Washington Working Papers in                      Linguistics.",
