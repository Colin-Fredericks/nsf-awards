 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Thomas               Gallagher, University of Virginia and Dr. Pierre Camus and Pierre               Pillet, Laboratoire Aime Cotton, Orsay, France.  The objective of               the project is to study highly correlated atomic systems in which               two of the atomic electrons are in similar orbit.                                                                                                               Atoms with two highly excited, correlated electrons present one of              the major challenges to present day atomic physics.  Although                   there have been many theories proposed, there remains very little               experimental information to guide the formation of the theories.                The investigators propose to study such atomic states experimen-                tally.  Specifically, they propose to use multistep laser excitation            of Ba atoms, which have two valence electrons, coupled with state               selective detection of the doubly excited states.  Such studies,                using rather different techniques, are currently underway in both               laboratories.  By combining the approaches and exploring new                    avenues, the investigators expect to be able to view the doubly                 excited atoms from different perspectives, gaining valuable new                 insights into their properties and guiding future theoretical                   developments.  Both the US and French groups have substantial                   research records in the study of highly excited states in general,              and have developed many of the techniques upon which the proposed               program rests.  In addition, both research groups have ready                    access to theoretical groups with expertise in correlated atomic                systems.",
