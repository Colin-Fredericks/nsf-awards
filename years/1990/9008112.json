 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the computer modelling of the                   fluid dynamics of aquatic animal propulsion, in which the fluid                 motion is described by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations               and the immersed organism is regarded as a filament undergoing                  time-dependent motion.  In contrast to previous studies there is                no restriction placed on the size of the Reynolds number or on                  the dependence of the amplitude of the swimming motion upon its                 direction.  Among the specific goals of the research are the                    modelling of different modes of swimming such as jet propulsion                 and undulation and the modelling of three-dimensional motions.                  The motions of immersed animals in water have always been of                    interest to naturalists and fluid dynamicists, both for their                   inherent aesthetic beauty and for the insights they provide into                our understanding of the fluid dynamics of bodies moving in air                 and water.  Here the principal investigator will use the power of               a supercomputer to model the behavior of organisms swimming in                  water over a range of body shapes and sizes and speeds that has                 not been attempted before.",
