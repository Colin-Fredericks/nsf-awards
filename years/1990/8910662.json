 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professors Romuald N. Lipcius and Brian W.              Meehan of the Virginia Institute of Marine Science of the College               of William & Mary, in a research collaboration with Professors                  Karl Aiken of the University of the West Indies and Milton                      Haughton of Jamaica Fisheries, both in Jamaica.  The investigators              intend to use a recent technique (mitochondrial DNA restriction                 fragment analysis) to assess genetic and population hetero-geneity              in statistically sound samples from selected populations in                     Jamaica, Mexico, the Bahamas, and Bermuda of the spiny lobster                  Panilirus argus.                                                                                                                                                The key unresolved issue concerning the ecology and fishery                     biology of the spiny lobster and other widely dispersed marine                  species in the Caribbean pertains to the scales and degree of                   geographic differentiation of populations.  Resolution of this                  issue could lead to major advances in our understanding of                      ecological relationships (e.g., recruitment dynamics) and management            of this and other important Caribbean marine fisheries.                                                                                                         Spiny lobsters inhabit coastal waters from Bermuda to Brazil, and               their recruitment is affected by major oceanic current systems.  The            potential exists for pelagic transport of larvae throughout the                 Caribbean basin, thereby producing pan-Caribbean homogeneity in                 population structure.  Alternatively, larvae could be retained                  within local gyres, thereby producing geographic differentiation.               In order to assess the degree and scales of geographic differenti-              ation, it is critical to characterize population heterogeneity                  across and within geographic areas.  This Science in Developing                 Countries Program award will provide the requisite information for              (1) further investigations of geographic differentiation in the                 spiny lobster, (2) investigations of recruitment processes in                   widely dispersed Caribbean species, and (3) help to support the                 development of effective pan-Caribbean fisheries management.",
