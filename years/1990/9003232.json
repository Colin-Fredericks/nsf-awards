 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Richard Fisher of the                         University of California at Santa Barbara in a research                         collaboration with Professors G. Orsi, G. Capaldi, and                          L. Civetta of the University of Naples.                                                                                                                         One of southern Europe's great cities, Naples, is                               located on a young (approximately 33,500 years), large                          volume (greater than 80 cubic kilometers) ignimbrite                            sheet resulting from a volcanic eruption.  This Campanian                       Ignimbrite (CI), occurs up to 100 km. from its probable                         source, having moved as an energetic pyroclastic flow                           across high mountain ridges.  The source of the CI is                           believed to be in the Phlegrean Fields, located in the                          Neapolitan suburbs.                                                                                                                                             The researchers intend (1) to establish chronology and                          chemical trends of the initial Campanian eruption that                          produced the first-deposited tephra and the ignimbrite                          sheet; (2) to determine the type of initiating eruption                         (pryoclastic and/or hydroclastic) and subsequent                                eruptive activity; and (3) to interpret flow mechanisms                         by studying the origin of the thin ground layer that                            occurs beneath the CI.  Detailed field and laboratory                           studies of this ignimbrite are necessary for the purpose                        of unraveling its history and what that portends for                            future activity.  If the CI originated from beneath the                         sea, it will be the first such ignimbrite to be                                 documented, and it would be possible for the first time                         to characterize physical and chemical attributes of                             subaqueous ignimbrite and provide petrologic criteria                           for their recognition.",
