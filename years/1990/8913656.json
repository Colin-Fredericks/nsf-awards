 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award continues support of Tandem Mass Spectrometry                   activities at the Mid Atlantic Mass Spectrometry (MAMS) laboratory              at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC).  One of                  several approaches to mass spectrometry (MS), tandem MS provides                high resolution measurements of compounds with the high molecular               weights typical of proteins, nucleic acids and other biopolymers.               Efforts sponsored by this award will focus on improving techniques              for analysis of proteins and peptides using the tandem instrument;              a variety of collaborative research projects will be initiated or               continued.                                                                           Mass spectrometry plays an increasingly important role in the              structural analysis of biomolecules.  Information about protein                 sequence and structure, including naturally occurring                           modifications of proteins, and similar kinds of information about               polysaccharides and other branched chain polymers are obtained                  with great difficulty by other techniques.  The MAMS laboratory                 includes facilities at UMBC and at The Johns Hopkins University                 School of Medicine.  Both were established as shared instrument                 resources for collaborative and service projects.  Because of the               considerable expense of acquisition and operation of tandem MS                  instruments, this type of analysis is not routinely available at                most research institutions.  The UMBC facility provides the                     research community at UMBC and at numerous other institutions with              access to the kind of skilled mass spectrometry needed in many                  areas of modern biological research.",
