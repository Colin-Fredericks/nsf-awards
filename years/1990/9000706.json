 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to The Pennsylvania State University                to continue their Research Experience for Undergraduates Site.                  Eight undergraduate psychology majors with an interest in the                   biological aspects of experimental psychology will be recruited to              participate in this program at the completion of their sophomore                or junior year.  An effort will be made to attract a majority of                minority students using the techniques and contacts which have                  enabled staff to train over 40 minority Ph.D.s since 1969 and five              minority students in the 1989-90 NSF REU Sites program.                                                                                                         The students selected will work as apprentices with one of seven                members of the faculty, all nationally known for their research and             all highly experienced at preparing undergraduates who have gone                on to graduate school.  This faculty recently received a major                  equipment grant form the U.S. Department of Education that has                  provided facilities for research and training.                                                                                                                  The program is designed to have students work full-time for eight               weeks in the summer, gradually exposing them to all aspects of                  psychophysiological research and to selected aspects of                         physiological psychology.  Students will design an independent                  research project during the latter part of the summer and complete              it with the help of their Penn State mentor during the following                academic year.  At the end of the spring semester, they will                    present their research results at a department colloquium.  In some             cases, the research will be submitted for publication or                        presentation at professional meetings.  Every effort will be made               to encourage and assist students to gain admission to graduate                  programs, either at Penn State or elsewhere.",
