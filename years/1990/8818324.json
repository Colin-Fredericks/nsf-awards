 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent IR experiments on the time dependent vibrational and                     rotational response of CN-ions in crystals indicate that the                    vibrational dynamics of this diatomic molecule in solids leads to               unexpected lasing behavior.  If other diatomic defects in crystals have         properties related to CN- then solid state vibrational lasers could be          practical for a variety of applications in the infrared and far-infrared        spectral regions.  One fundamental experimental problem has been                the lack of coincidences between near-IR color center laser pumps               and the overtone frequencies of molecules which can be doped into               crystals.  The discovery by the PI that nonresonant UV laser                    radiation can be used to pump the vibrational manifold of CN- opens             up another avenue through which the IR radiative properties of                  molecules in solids can be studied.  The interfacing of a pulsed UV             excimer laser to an ultrahigh resolution fourier-transform infrared             spectrometer will provide a new efficient type of time resolved                 vibrational spectroscopy which can be used to explore multilevel IR             energy transfer of molecules in the solid state.  For the examination           of complex molecules with subnsecond relaxation times the fourier-              transform infrared spectrometer will be used in a different mode to             time analyze the delay between picosecond pulses in the                         measurement of fast saturable absorption in the anharmonic vibrator.",
