 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a department that has, over the past five years, modernized and              enhanced its biology curriculum and introduced much new equipment, the          introduction of flow cytometry can further enhance the students'                education. A new benchtop flow cytometer is being introduced in the             non-majors biology course, the introductory sequence for majors, and in         six upper division laboratory courses, as well as student research              projects. Thus, many students can benefit from this new and rapidly             expanding technology, which will greatly enhance their preparation for          graduate school, medical school, or industry. This sophisticated                instrument can serve as a focal element in a curriculum designed to             offer introductory through advanced students a progression of                   vertically-integrated, hands-on experiences with modern biological              tools. The college will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
