 "awd_abstract_narration": "Macalester College is introducing interferometry into the                       undergraduate physics program through an advanced laboratory course             on laser spectroscopy and faculty/student collaborative research.               This is accomplished through the use of three different                         interferometers:  a Michelson interferometer, a high finesse                    spherical interferometer, and a large aperture plane-parallel                   Fabry-Perot interferometer.  All of these instruments are used to               illustrate the concepts of free spectral range, finesse, and                    instrument profile introduced in the Laser Spectroscopy course.                 The Michelson interferometer is used to investigate optical Fourier             transform spectroscopy as an example of the power and limitations               of the transform techniques that have become so widespread in                   modern science.  The spherical interferometer is used to study the              cavity modes of different laser systems, such as He-Ne, dye, and                diode lasers.  The plane-parallel interferometer is used as a high              resolution spectrometer to study laser, atomic vapor, and solid                 state light sources.  The latter two instruments illustrate the                 hierarchy of optical bandwidths, from the inhomogeneous Doppler                 profile of a gas to the gain limited bandwidth of a single mode                 laser.  Two general purpose computers control and analyze the data              from the new instruments.  A graphic programming language allows                students to program these computers quickly and efficiently.  The               instruments support faculty/student research in solid state                     spectroscopy, fiber optics, and astronomy when the Laser                        Spectroscopy course is not in session.                                                                                                                          The College is matching the award with an equal amount of funds.4",
