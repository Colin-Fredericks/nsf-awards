 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of stochastic models for scheduling problems far                   from making the problems harder, tends to make them more                        tractable.  This is illustrated by previous results on the                      scheduling of jobs on parallel machines with the weighted                       flowtime as objective criterion:  While the deterministic problem               is NP-hard, it has been proved that a simple, easily applied                    heuristic (Smith's Rule) is very close to optimal in the general                stochastic setting.                                                                  Continuing focus on heuristics will be used to tackle three                further stochastic scheduling problems of practical importance:                 Scheduling of parallel machines subject to due dates, preemptive                scheduling of parallel machines, and scheduling of machines in                  series (flowshops).  The least restrictive assumptions on                       processing time distributions will be used.                                          A deeper level of understanding for the dynamic optimal                    simultaneous operation of several machines is suggested in the                  new \"Restless Bandits\" model of Peter Whittle.  Whittle suggests                a Lagrangian relaxation and a priority rule which generalizes the               Gittins' index of bandit problems as upper and lower bounds for                 an optimal policy.  Other important recent results on control of                queueing networks are those obtained by J.M. Harrison and L.M.                  Wein, using Brownian control problems as approximations.                             Another objective of this research is to prove Whittle's                   conjecture that his bounds are asymptotically optimal, and to                   discover a strong connection between Whittle's approach and that                of Harrison and Wein.  Based on these results it should be                      possible to derive some new heuristics and to prove their                       asymptotic optimality.",
