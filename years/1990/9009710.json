 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate how a reasoner can improve its                   understanding of an incompletely understood domain through the                  application of what it already knows to novel problms in that                   domain.  Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past               experience stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel                  situations, plan for novel goals, or solve novel problems.                      However, this process assumes that past experiences are well                    understood and provide good \"lessons\" to be used for future                     situations.  This assumption is usually false when one is                       learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered                     previously in this domain might not have been understood                        completely.  The research will develop techniques by which a                    reasoner can (a) use domain knowledge that may not be completely                understood to solve novel problems, (b) maintain an explicit                    model of the \"gaps\" in its knowledge base, (c) learn by filling                 in these gaps when the information it needs become available, and               hence (d) gradually evolve a better understanding of the domain.                This research is important for several reasons.  On the                         theoretical side, it will contribute to our understanding of                    learning, explanation, and experience-based reasoning.  On the                  practical side, it will provide the foundations for technology                  that will allow us to design practical resoning systems that can                learn and improve their own performance through experience.",
