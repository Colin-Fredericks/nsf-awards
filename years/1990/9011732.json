 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Bishop Museum is located in Honolulu, Hawaii and its                        systematic anthropological collections comprise some 170,000                    specimens.  These are significant to the advancement of knowledge               of the natural and cultural history of Hawaii and the Pacific.                  They constitute a historic baseline for the understanding of                    Pacific peoples past and present, and this resource is used by                  scientists around the world, as well as by the local academic                   community.  For the people of Hawaii it offers an important                     source of information about their cultural backgrounds, and the                 collections provide documentation of traditions which otherwise                 would have been lost.  To improve storage and access to these                   materials the Bishop Museum has constructed a new four-story                    building and will transfer the collections to it.  This National                Science Foundation grant will provide funds to purchase a                       compactor storage system.  Compactors consist of moveable storage               units (carefully designed to minimize damage to materials) which                have been widely adopted by museums because they make extremely                 efficient use of space.  Not only will this system safely house                 the existing Bishop Museum anthropological collection but will                  also provide room for future growth.                                                                                                                            This project is important for several reasons.  First, it will                  assist in the preservation of scientifically important and                      irreplaceable anthropological materials.  Secondly, it will                     facilitate access by both researchers and the interested public.",
