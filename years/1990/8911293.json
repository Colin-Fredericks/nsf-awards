 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a multifaceted program aimed at diagnosing and                          understanding the behavior of processes responsible for                         interannual fluctuations in the general circulation and climate.                There are three parts to the investigation. The first part                      attempts to make better identification of the mechanisms                        responsible for the interannual variations in tropospheric                      temperature discovered under the current grant. The second                      intention is to explore the mechanisms responsible for                          interannual variations in globally-integrated atmospheric                       angular momentum with focus on the 1982-1983 El Nino event. The                 third task of the proposal is to diagnose the intra-annual                      fluctuations in the different components of diabatic heating and                their role in generating available potential energy.                                                                                                            The proposed investigation is very important because the intended               comparisons between the large, model output and observed data                   sets will help to isolate the specific deficiencies in the global               observing network and the existing GCM formulations, which should               receive the highest priority by the scientific research                         community. Equally important, this proposal will provide better                 understanding of the atmospheric energy budget and angular                      momentum which could have significant implications for                          understanding the climate processes.",
