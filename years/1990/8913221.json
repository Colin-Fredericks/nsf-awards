 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a sabbatical research                   visit to Switzerland by Professor Craig R. Baumrucker of                        Pennsylvania State University.  He will work with Professor                     Juergen Blum of the Institute of Animal Breeding of the                         University of Bern and Professors E. R. Froesch and J. Zapf                     of the Department of Internal Medicine, University of Zurich.                   They have mutual interest and complementary expertise in                        studies of the effects of bovine colostrum growth factor                        (IGF-I) in the neonatal calf.  Dr. Blum has extensive                           experience in surgical and physiological work with ruminants;                   Dr. Baumrucker is more accomplished in the cellular-molecular                   aspects of the ruminant mammary gland.  The specific objectives                 of their current research are to determine if dietary IGF-I                     in bovine colostrum affects intestinal growth in vivo and to                    quantify the survival of bioactive dietary IGF-I in the                         intestine of the calf.  They will also investigate the                          occurrence of type I and II IGF receptors in intestinal                         membranes.                                                                                                                                                      The recent discoveries of numerous growth factors has opened                    a new and exciting era for the understanding of animal tissue                   development and growth, with implications for agricultural                      productivity as well as human biology.  By testing the                          hypothesis that colostrum containing IGF-I has beneficial                       growth effects upon the bovine neonatal intestine, this study                   will contribute substantially to understanding of what                          happens to both colostrum and milk in the gut.  Isolation of                    cell stimulatory factors and understanding of IGF-I are                         prerequisites for development of recombinant growth factors.                    Since human and bovine colostrum are identical, the results                     of this study may benefit the human species.",
