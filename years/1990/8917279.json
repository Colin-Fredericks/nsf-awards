 "awd_abstract_narration": "Small and isolated populations are of interest to biologists               because they have the potential to become new species.  In the                  absence of human intervention their evolutionary and ecological                 fates are determined by their genetic variation, and this in turn               is governed by their breeding structure.  The proposed research                 will examine the breeding structure of two small populations of                 Darwin's Finches on one of the Galapagos Islands.  Darwin's                     Finches are unusually suitable for this investigation because                   they live in undisturbed environments, and their evolution has                  been well studied.  The two chosen populations are Geospiza                     fortis and G. scandens.  Their residency on the island of Daphne                Major and their tameness has allowed the establishment of                       pedigrees; and by extending these pedigrees and following the                   fates of known individuals by observation, the PI's will                        establish the circumstances and frequencies of inbreeding and of                hybridization, and the fitness consequences of both.                                 Small populations like these Darwin's Finches are of                       interest to conservation biologists because they are liable to                  become extinct.  Results of this study will have potential                      applications to the conservation and management of small and                    endangered populations of animals elsewhere.  Demographic and                   genetic consequences of small population sizes are increasingly                 being incorporated into the modeling of extinction-prone                        populations in order to identify vulnerable components of life                  histories on the one hand, and long-term, minimum, viable                       population sizes on the other.  The study populations are small                 and fluctuate in numbers.  With this study their genetic                        structure will be understood. Understanding the dynamics of such                populations under natural conditions is essential if we are to                  reliably assess the future course of other populations which are                subjected to disturbances.",
