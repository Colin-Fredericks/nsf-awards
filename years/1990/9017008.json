Eleven universities attended by these students are being provided               awards of $6,000 each to assist the students with their education               and research.  The students will receive $5,000 of each award.                  These awards are designed to provide special encouragement to                   students who were judged worthy of a Minority Graduate                          Fellowship, but who, for lack of funds could not be awarded one.",
