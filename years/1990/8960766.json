 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optical instruments for performing linewidth measurement                        or for finding the geometry of small features are limited by                    the resolution associated with the wavelength of light.  Basis                  optical theory states that features small than one-half of the                  illumination wavelength are unresolvable.  However,                             information is present in the image about higher spatial                        frequencies than given by the optical resolution.  By utilizing                 deconvolution, superresolution, or high resolution microscopy                   techniques, information about higher spatial frequencies may                    be extracted.  The aim of this research is to investigate                       techniques of obtaining accurate submicron linewidth                            measurement for implementation in an interferometric                            optical profiler with the hope of measuring features on the                     order of 0.1 um in extent.  An applicable technique would be                    useful in a commercial product.  Possible applications include                  the measurement of integrated circuit or integrated optical                     device geometries as well as measurement of pits in compact                     disk masters, and magnetic recording head geometry.",
