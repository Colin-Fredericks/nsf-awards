This                     project is part of a large international effort to understand                   arc-continent collision and plans to conduct marine                             geographical studies on the Taiwan collision Zone.  The                         offshore region of Taiwan is one of the best areas in the                       world to study the incipient processes of arc-continent                         collision.  The work proposed here can lead to major                            improvements in our understanding of the structural and                         sedimentological evolution of arc-continent collision zone.                     This project is jointly supported by the NSF and the Taiwan                     National Science Council. 9046553                                               Kerlin                                                                          The National Science Foundation sees the direct involvement                     of undergraduates in science and engineering research as an                     important management tool for encouraging young people to                       pursue careers in research and development.  This supplemental                  support for \"Research Experiences for Undergraduates\" at the                    University of Tennessee will involve two students in an                         ongoing U.S.-Hungary cooperative research project in nuclear                    engineering.",
