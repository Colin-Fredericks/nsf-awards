The proposed research will focus in the                                         engineering subject area of signal processing,                                  but the techniques that could be developed                                      will have broad applicability in engineering                                    education.  Six highly experienced faculty                                      members at five different universities will                                     collaborate in this research to organize,                                       write, test, and produce a book of exercises                                    for use with a normal signal processing                                         course.  These exercises will use the computer                                  in a fundamentally different way to utilize                                     the numerical and graphical power of the                                        computer together with a modern interactive                                     software system as the basis of an improve                                      engineering educational methodology.",
