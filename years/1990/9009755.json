 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to build CEP, an environment for               Conditional Equational Programming.  This will include a practical,             efficient interpreter for the equational language, facilities for               proving program correctness, and for doing program transformation and           synthesis.                                                                                                                                                        Equational Programming is gaining wide popularity as the cleanest             way to provide in a simple, well-understood, and uniform framework the          features of both Lisp-like functional programming and Prolog-like               logic programming.  A program is a set of (conditional) equations for           example {0 + x = x, s(x) + y = s(x+y)} and a computation consists of            solving an equation, for example x + y = s(s(0)) (finding                       substitutions that make two terms equal in the theory).                                                                                                         A new procedure, formulated as a set of inference rules has been                developed for equation solving.  This formulation not only improves             current methods, but also permits easy incorporation of techniques,             that are being developed, for detecting equations that are                      unsatisfiable, thus pruning the search space even further. Also,                building on previous results in the theory of conditional rewriting,            methods will be investigated for proving the correctness of a given             equational program.                                                                                                                                               Building CEP and distributing it to other researchers will have a             significant impact in the fields of logic and functional programming.           It will spur a lot more development and the use of this paradigm as             the cleanest way to combine logic and functional programming.",
