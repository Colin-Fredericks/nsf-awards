 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years American manufacturers have faced increasing               competition from abroad.  In addition to having low prices, being               competitive now requires outstanding quality, short lead times,                 and increased responsiveness to customer's changing demands.                    Companies that have successfully responded to this changing                     environment have done so by decreasing work in process (WIP) and                finished goods inventory levels thereby allowing early detection                of quality problems, shorter lead times, and less vulnerability                 to changing demands.                                                                 A major cause of high WIP levels and long lead times is the                lack of synchronization between fabrication and assembly.  Where                they are applicable, Kanban and other such pull systems achieve a               high degree of synchronization.  Unfortunately, Kanban is                       suitable only for repetitive manufacturing environments.  Thus,                 less effective but more applicable systems such as Materials                    Requirements Planning continue to find application.                                  This project will develop a production control strategy,                   called Synchronized Production, that offers the increased                       performance of Kanban in a much wider variety of manufacturing                  environments.  IBM Corporation is funding certain portions of the               research that pertain directly to a circuit board plant.  The                   result of the joint NSF and IBM funding will be the basic theory                behind the new control strategy as well as experience with                      portions of its implementation.  By combining industry and                      government support, this project will develop both the                          theoretical and applied results needed to enable Synchronized                   Production to play a role in restoring the competitiveness of                   American manufacturing.",
