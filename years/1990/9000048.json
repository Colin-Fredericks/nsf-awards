 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scripps Institute of Oceanography will operate four                         research vessels: R/V MELVILLE, a 245' general oceanographic                    vessel constructed by the Navy in 1969; R/V THOMAS WASHINGTON, a                208' research vessel constructed by the Navy in 1965; R/V NEW                   HORIZON, a 170' research vessel constructed by the University of                California in 1978; and R/V ROBERT GORDON SPROUL, a 125' vessel                 built in 1981 and subsequently converted for research purposes.                                                                                                 These vessels are part of a fleet used by the National Science                  Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.                                                                                                                       The R/V's T.WASHINGTON and MELVILLE operate worldwide, while the                R/V NEW HORIZON operates primarily in the northeastern Pacific.                 The R/V SPROUL operates primarily in the coastal waters of                      California.",
