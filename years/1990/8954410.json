 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thirty undergraduate physics faculty from the southwestern section of           the country are receiving intensive training in the application of              microcomputers to undergraduate physics laboratories.  The workshop is          being conducted by experts from the university, which has an extensive          program to modernize their laboratories by equipping them with                  microcomputers to simplify the collection of data and permit more               advanced phenomena to be investigated.  The participants are being              selected from two and four-year colleges from the region with preference        given to those from institutions servicing significant numbers of               Hispanic and native American students.  During the week the participants        are listening to experts discuss and demonstrate equipment and                  experiments which have improved the quality of physics laboratories.  In        the afternoons, the participants are using the equipment discussed under        the direction of the same experts.   The workshop is introducing the            undergraduate faculty to the concept of microcomputer based laboratories        and to the data processing concepts that make this innovation possible.         They are becoming familiar with the operation of the equipment and it is        expected that they and their students are becoming better prepared to           apply microcomputers to the study of physics.",
