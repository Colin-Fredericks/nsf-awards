 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kana will address the general question of \"light respiration\"               in marine waters.  Considerable direct and indirect evidence                    indicates that light can significantly affect oxygen consumption:               in some cases elevating the rate up to 10 times the rate of dark                respiration.  What this stimulation of oxygen consumption means                 in terms of organic cycling is very poorly understood due to the                historical difficulty in measuring the fluxes and the                           simultaneous occurance of at least 5 distinguishable oxygen                     uptake processes.  Recent development in Dr. Kana's laboratory of               two isotope (180) methods capable of measuring oxygen cycling in                the light provide the basis for tackling this problem.                                                                                                          The research coordinates field measurements of light-dependent                  oxygen uptake and evolution in an estuarine habitat with                        controlled laboratory studies of oxygen cycling in phytoplankton                species isolated from the study site.  The major variables of                   interest are phytoplankton composition, defined by seasonal                     cycles, and light intensity.  Field experiments center around                   characterizing the effects of seasonal and event scale phenomena                on oxygen cycling, especially as mediated by the phytoplankton.                 Laboratory experiments center around the identification of the                  physiological processes responsible for light-dependent oxygen                  uptake.  In a related study, Dr. Kana will continue collaboration               with Drs. Carpenter and Capone in the study of oxygen cycling in                Trichodesmium.",
