 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research proposal is to test the hypothesis               that specific types of germ cells in the testis produce proteins                that stimulated Sertoli cell function. Pachytene spermatocytes                  and round spermatids are isolated by centrifugal elutriation and                the purified populations of germ cells are incubated for 24 hours               in vitro, after which the conditioned media is collected. These                 germ cell proteins are dialyzed, concentrated and lyophilized.                  Sertoli cells are grown in vitro on Matrigel coated filters                     mounted i a novel bicameral culture chamber system that mimics to               a large extent the growth of these cells in vivo. Using the                     concentrated germ cell proteins it will be possible to 1)show                   that metabolically labeled germ cell proteins are specifically                  bound and sequestered by Sertoli cells 2) demonstrate that germ                 cell proteins stimulate the secretion of several specific                       immunopreciptiable Sertoli cell proteins 3) using ELISA for                     transferrin secretion from Sertoli cells it will be possible to                 purify the germ cell stimulatory protein by liquid chromatography               and raise antibodies to the protein for future functional                       studies. These studies will provide a significant insight into                  the paracrine interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells                 in the testis. Furthermore, purification of the germ cell                       paracrine protein and production of its antibody will provide                   probes for elucidation of the mechanisms that locally regulate                  differentiation and development during spermatogenesis.                         %%%                                                                             The maturation of sperm cells in mammals requires the interaction               of these cells with surrounding cells. This study will elucidate                the mechanisms of some of those required interactions.",
