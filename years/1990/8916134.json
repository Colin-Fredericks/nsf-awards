 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of a successful investigation into               the antarctic surface and boundary layer wind field, with                       specific emphasis on the extremely strong down-slope katabatic                  winds in the vicinity of Terra Nova Bay.  The outward flowing                   surface air is an integral part of the meridional circulation,                  together with inflow and convergence aloft, and generally sinking               motion over the continent.                                                                                                                                      The pattern of katabatic winds over the sloping ice sheet is                    highly irregular, with air converging into several narrow coastal               regions to produce locally what are recognized as the strongest                 and most persistent surface winds in the world.  Known examples                 are at Cape Denison and Port Martin in Adelie Land (facing                      Australia), and in Terra Nova Bay on the western coast of the                   Ross Sea.                                                                                                                                                       Specific tasks to be undertaken as part of this project are to                  complete the kinematic, dynamic, and climatological analysis of                 specific katabatic events, to integrate high resolution satellite               imagery into specific case studies, and to carry out extensive                  numerical modeling at various spatial scales.  An existing array                of automatic weather stations has provided the primary data set                 for this study; it is being extended by the satellite imagery                   which will be used to investigate the offshore propagation of the               katabatic air stream. The modeling effort is being extended to                  continent-wide simulations using a grid spacing of 40 kilometers                in order to explore the climatic impacts of the coastal                         confluence zone dynamics.",
