 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two senior investigators and two postdocs will study various               aspects of differential geometry and Riemann surfaces.  One will                establish the finiteness of string theories to all orders of                    perturbation theory.  This will require the development of                      holomorphic supergeometry and new parametrizations of Teichmuller               space suggested by Feynman diagrams.  The second investigator                   will work on problems in complex differential geometry.  This                   will include a study of Hermitian symmetric domains, holomorphic                mappings between them, and their classification.  One postdoc                   will analyze homomorphic immersions between compact complex                     hyperbolic space forms.  The second will derive further estimates               for eigenvalues of manifolds with conelike singularities.                            Four investigators will study various aspects of                           differential geometry.  Several of the problems to be studied                   have their origins in string theory.  This theory has been used                 to describe complex interactions between elementary particles.                  In this theory, each particle is represented by a string which                  vibrates in ten dimensional space.  These investigations are part               of a continuing effort by mathematicians and physicists to use                  this new theory to explain the results of high-energy particle                  experiments.",
