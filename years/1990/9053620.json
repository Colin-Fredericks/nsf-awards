 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project creates a prototype set of processes and products for an            international team of curriculum developers to work collaboratively with        research scientists in the International Geosphere Biosphere Project            (IGBP) of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).  This          is a high priority area for research in teaching and learning, science          the large investment being made by the NSF, other U.S. organizations,           and other countries in IGBP research provides an unprecedented                  opportunity to inform science education.  The project is urgent with            regard to availability of data because of a special opportunity created         by the ICSU.  The ICSU has initiated a science education project that           will translate research findings of IGBP scientists and disseminate them        for use in the education systems of the world.  Developers from the U.S.        and U.K. will draft the first prototype instructional modules in a              workshop in 1990, as part of a two-year formative development process.          The project takes advantage of this opportunity to build knowledge and          experience that will establish infrastructure for such collaborations           among the scientific and educational communities.  The project will not         only create and test prototype learning materials, but also document key        factors involved in the process, such as roles of scientists in the             project, incentives and mechanisms for their involvement, opportunities         and obstacles to scientist-educator collaboration internationally,              multi-country testing and adaptation of learning materials, mechanisms          for teacher and student involvement in scientific research processes.",
