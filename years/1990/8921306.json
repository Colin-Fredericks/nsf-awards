 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the relationship between climate change, ocean               circulation and the carbon cycle is one of the greatest                         challenges for paleoclimatologists.  The strong feedbacks between               these systems result in complex interactions which make it                      difficult to predict the future course of climate change.                       Paleoclimatologic and paleoceanographic research has much to                    contribute to this research because, in recent geological                       history, large changes in each of these systems have occurred.                  The distribution of 14C provides one very important tracer of the               past carbon cycle because its distribution and concentration is                 controlled by carbon cycles processes and radioactive decay.                    Thus it is possible to constrain the rates of change through the                judicious measurement of past 14C distribution.  The goal of this               research is to continue the 14C age analysis of marine sediments                on a variety of projects with paleoclimatic implications.  The                  projects include: 1) studies of deep sea dissolution of calcium                 carbonate to determine the response of the ocean to the rapid                   change in atmospheric CO2 during the last deglaciation; 2)                      studies of the difference in 14C between surface and deep water                 to improve our understanding of the circulation response of the                 deep ocean to the last deglaciation; and 3) improvement of the                  deglacial chronology of both terrestrial and marine events                      associated with the Younger Dryas, a rapid, short-lived reversal                of climatic change associated with the last deglaciation.  This                 research is important because of its potential for enhanced                     understanding of the global carbon cycle.",
