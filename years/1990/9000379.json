 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water-saturated sandy soils are susceptible to                                  liquefaction when subjected to strong ground                                    shaking, such as occurs during an earthquake.                                   Liquefied soils experience a decrease in                                        bearing strength: this can lead to the partial                                  or total collapse of buildings standing on                                      liquefied soils.                                                                                                                                                The aim of this proposal is to verify the                                       analyses used to predict liquefaction due to                                    earthquake loading.  Since the field data                                       needed for this verification is extremely                                       difficult to obtain, data is being used                                         instead from laboratory experiments performed                                   on geotechnical centrifuges.  This is a                                         relatively new technique for soil testing                                       which is becoming well accepted in the                                          geotechnical research community.  The                                           technique for simulating earthquakes on                                         centrifuges is being developed, and the                                         results obtained have generated confidence in                                   the method: questions that remain to be                                         answered are being addressed in this study.                                                                                                                     Different geotechnical structures, including                                    sloping ground, dams, coastal dikes, and                                        embankments are being investigated so as to                                     validate the applicability of the liquefaction                                  analysis methods to a variety of geotechnical                                   structures.  Class A predictions - which                                        involve predicting the soil response without                                    knowing the measured results - are used for                                     later comparison with measured results.                                                                                                                         The Earth Technology Corporation is                                             responsible for the management of the project,                                  for providing carefully calibrated soil                                         samples, for overseeing the testing program,                                    as well as being responsible for receiving,                                     distributing and documenting data, in                                           conjunction with the Adjudication Committee.

The Adjudication                                           Committee acts as an independent steering                                       group.

Collectively, they are                                    examining the mechanisms of liquefaction, the                                   development and verification of analytical and                                  numerical models, soil-structure interaction                                    for conditions of limited and large                                             deformations, and the effect of interfaces                                      between soil layers of differing                                                permeabilities.                                                                                                                                                 This study will contribute significantly to                                     improving the understanding of the soil                                         liquefaction phenomenon, and to the                                             reliability of methods used to predict the                                      occurrence of liquefaction and the resulting                                    damage to structures.  This action is for                                       support of the program at the University of                                     Colorado at Boulder.",
