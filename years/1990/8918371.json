 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first objective of the proposed research is to quantify the                 relationship between structural design and functional performance of            the respiratory system.  The PI's testing a hypothesis of economic              design of biological systems.  He will use an integrated systems                approach, considering: all levels of transport of oxygen from the               environment to the target organelles, the mitochondria; and the steps           in transport of fuel from the capillaries to the mitochondria.  This            should help to define the factors that limit muscular work, and to              determine those steps in the transport of oxygen and fuel, if any,              where there is a built-in redundancy or safety factor.  These studies           should also make it possible to draw conclusions: about the importance          of genetic determination of design at the organelle, cell, organ and            system level; and about the potential for functional and structural             adjustment in response to training or damage from injury or disease.                                                                                            The second objective is to test the hypothesis that desert animals              possess special adaptations for dramatically reducing their food                requirements when they are faced with prolonged shortages of food               during droughts.  Metabolic rate is affected by dietary energy intake           in all mammals, including humans.  It seems likely the dramatic changes         proposed for desert animals will be simply an \"exaggerated\" response of         general physiological mechanisms.  Thus, our studies may provide                important new insights into this response and its modulation in humans.",
