 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project compares the contrasting careers and personal lives of           two great 20th Century British women scientists, one a theoretician             and the other an experimentalist, and seeks to clarify the social and           scientific determinants of success and of failure for women in                  science.  The lives and works of these two women intersected in the             1930s, when both were based at Oxford, while further belonging to a             group of a dozen ideologically sensitive scientists who pioneered the           rise of molecular biology in Britain.  The case study of Dorothy C.             Hodgkin (1910-), sole recipient of the Nobel Prize for chemistry in             1964, will be explored as a paradigm of success, including the                  establishment of a research school composed of over a hundred men and           women disciples.  The case study of Dorothy Wrinch (1894-1976), a               mathematician turned biologist who had been considered a \"woman                 Einstein,\" but who came to spend the later part of her career obsessed          with a theory which her men rivals erroneously claimed to have                  refuted, will be explored as a paradigm of failure.  The project seeks          to exhibit and clarify the diversity of women's experience in science           in its historical, scientific, and political contexts.                            The interactive component of this project includes: a) teaching a             new course \"Social history of women scientists from the French                  revolution to the present\" for both graduate and undergraduate                  students; b) the organization of an interdisciplinary and                       international symposium on \"Women's lives in science:  Historical and           contemporary perspectives,\" at which historians, sociologists and               practicing scientists will present their experiences; c) teaching a             new seminar on \"Research schools of molecular biology in the US, UK             and France, 1920-1970\"; d) the organization of a monthly colloquium to          stimulate interaction between the scientific, historical and literary           communities, especially students, at the host institution.                        This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and (2)          to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by              providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
