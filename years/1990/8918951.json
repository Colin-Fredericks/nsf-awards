 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visual information is carried by the optic nerves to a major                    center called the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which in                    turn projects to two major areas of the cortex of the brain,                    called Areas 17 and 18.  When a single cell in the visual                       pathway responds to a visual stimulus, that stimulus is said to                 be in the cell's \"receptive field.\"  Past discoveries have shown                that some cells in the visual cortex only respond to stimuli in                 particular locations and having particular properties (such as                  orientation of a line, or movement in a certain direction), which               may be quite complex.  Cortical cells were discovered to be                     organized in a columnar fashion, where cells within a column                    share sensitivity to a preferred visual stimulus.  This study                   will examine the cortical connections in Area 17 that extend                    horizontally, among the columns.  Cellular dye labels,                          autoradiography, and the new methods of optical recording will be               used to visualize the anatomy of the connections.  Physiological                recordings in a newly developed preparation of an isolated slice                of cortex will reveal how these horizontal connections function                 at the synaptic level.  Together these studies will clarify how                 visual information over a wide region of the animal's visual                    world are integrated in the visual cortex.  The results of this                 novel approach will be very important for visual science, and may               have impact on other areas of neuroscience and information                      processing studies.",
