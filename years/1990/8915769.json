 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to support Sm-Nd investigations of                     Adirondack metamorphic rocks that have been dated by U-Pb zircon                methods.  Attention is focused primarily on ~1300 Ma tonalites                  (Highlands) and alaskitic-tonalitic gneiss (Lowlands).                          Preliminary results suggest that the Highland gneisses have                     relatively young Nd-model ages (~1300-1450 Ma) indicating that                  they represent infusions of new crustal material into the                       Adirondack region at this time.  The same data indicate that this               is also true of ~1250 Ma tonaltiic rocks (Elzevir plutons) in the               Central Metasedimentary Belt of Ontario.  The chemistry of all                  these rocks suggests that they are arc-derived, and their                       presence suggests that the Adirondack-Central Metasedimentary                   Belt region was dominated by arc magmatism at ~1300 Ma.  The                    present study is designed to provide a thorough Sm-Nd  analysis                 of the Adirondack Highland tonalites and related gneisses whose                 age is known.  In addition, ~1250 Ma Lowland granitoids will be                 investigated to determine whether they exhibit Nd-model ages                    similar to, or differing from, those of the Highlands.  These                   results should help to clarify whether, or not, the Adirondack                  Highlands and Lowlands represent distinct terranes sutured                      together along the Carthage-Colton Mylonite Zone.  In addition,                 the Nd-Model ages will help to ascertain whether the Lowland                    granitoids represent juvenile crustal additions.  Data will also                be collected for metasediments and gneisses related to the                      anorthosites in order to constrain their sources and evolution.                 All of these results have significant implications for the                      evolutionary history of the Grenville Province.",
