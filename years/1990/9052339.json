 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Political Science Department at                the University of Iowa to help purchase equipment to support a                  computer classroom which takes advantage of the confluence of                   advances in high speed microcomputers, advances in graphical                    capabilities for data analysis, and advances in interactive                     educational software to provide individualized, interactive                     instruction in quantitative analysis.  This approach to teaching                undergraduates political science is grounded in the understanding               that student interest in technical tools does not emerge in a                   substantive vacuum; rather, it emerges as an offshoot from a desire             to answer a real-world problems posed by the discipline.  Both the              initial interest in technical knowledge and the subsequent                      enthusiasm for its utility are intimately tied to the substance of              political problems \"discovered\" by students.  Hence, the Department             is intent on keeping this technical education in the courses where              those problems are in point.  The computer classroom should launch              many students on an intellectual voyage of discovery, a voyage                  where their new technical knowledge could permit them to study                  politics and public policy in ways previously beyond their reach.
