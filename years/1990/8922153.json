 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Vincent                  Pigott and his colleagues will conduct three seasons of                         archaeological excavation at sites in the Khao Wong Prachan                     Valley in central Thailand.  Preliminary work by Dr. Pigott and                 his Thai collaborator in this valley has shown that it contains                 an unusual group of culturally and technologically related copper               production and habitation sites ranging in date from the                        mid-third millennium B.C. to the early first millennium A.D.                    Among the largest prehistoric metal production sites known in                   Asia, they offer a  unique opportunity to study the technology                  and organization of large-scale copper production -- as a                       continuum from mine to finished product -- within its                           sociocultural context.  During each year of the project one site                will be excavated.  The data thus collected will permit the team                to establish a relative chronology which will then be fixed with                radiocarbon dates.  They will also allow explication of the local               settlement pattern as it developed over time.  Finally,                         excavation and laboratory analysis will permit reconstruction of                the local processes of copper production.  This will be achieved                in part through metallurgical analysis and process replication in               the laboratory.                                                                                                                                                 The central Thailand sites are of archaeological interest because               they are so unusual.  Over the last two decades considerable                    scholarly attention has focussed on the origins and development                 of metallurgy across the Old World.  This has indicated that the                introduction of bronze metallurgy is associated with a complex of               social, political, and economic developments which mark the rise                of the state.  In Southeast Asia, however, the sociocultural                    context in which early copper and bronze metallurgy developed                   does not appear to include evidence for urban centers or a state-               like political structure.  It is in this light that Dr. Pigott's                research assumes its primary significance.                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 provide information on the interaction between technology and the               development of social complexity.  It challenges traditional                    ideas about the association between these variables.  Secondly,                 it will increase our knowledge about a part of the world which,                 from an archaeological perspective, is relatively unknown.",
