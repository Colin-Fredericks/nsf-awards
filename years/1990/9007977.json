 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal the P.I. develops a mechanistic model of                  competition that makes predictions about how resource use by                    plants influences both individual competitive ability and the                   population-level outcome of competition along productivity                      gradients.  The model is based on separating two components of                  competitive ability:  ability to deplete resources and ability to               tolerate depleted resources.  Using these two types of plant-                   resource interactions to predict the outcome of net plant-plant                 interactions is complex because the relative sizes of interacting               plants determine whether good depletors or good tolerators are                  the superior competitors and because depletion and tolerance                    abilities are determined by different plant traits.  The                        investigators develops specific predictions about these                         relationships and describe experiments to test them in a desert                 grassland community such models should have significant                         implication for many plant communities, included those endangered               worldwide.",
