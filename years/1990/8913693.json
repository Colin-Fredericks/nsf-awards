This special emphasis year will provide a                unique opportunity to make a major impact on the development of                 mathematical logic in Latin America.  A significant number of the               world's leading logicians will be in residence during the year,                 many of them for extended periods running from three months to the              full year.  Greater contact with logicians in the rest of the world             will serve to continue the development of a number of Latin                     American research centers in mathematical logic.                                                                                                                This award will support the participation of seven junior Latin                 American researchers, no more than six years from their Ph.D., in               this special emphasis year at MSRI.  Financial hardships in most                of the Latin America countries work particularly hard against young             researchers who have to compete with more senior established                    researchers for scarce funds.  Providing younger researchers in                 Latin America with the means of making contacts and engaging in                 collaborative research with leading researchers in their fields,                will help to ensure ties with the future leaders of mathematical                logic in the area.",
