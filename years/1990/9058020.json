 "awd_abstract_narration": "With a Presidential Young Investigator award from the National                  Science Foundation, Dr. Peter Salovey will continue his work one                motion as a central organizing process in human perception,                     cognition, and action.  Salovey's recent work has focused on the                effects of mood on important human decisions:  for example, he                  has shown that transient mood states influenced the manner in                   which people interpreted and evaluated physiological sensations.                These evaluations had important consequences for decisions that                 had critical implications for their physical health.  In other                  research, Salovey has shown how comparisons among individuals can               give rise to envy and jealousy, and how these emotions can be                   influenced by aspects of the situation that appear to have little               to do with them.  Salovey's work is important for several                       reasons.  Substantively, it heralds important new developments in               the study of emotions. In terms of scientific progression, the                  work is a departure from the more simple information processing                 approaches, which conceptualized human decision making as little                different from that of a computing machine.  The new view, with                 Salovey as one of the major proponents, sees human information                  processing as closely influenced by such human features as mood                 and emotion. This is a more realistic, if more difficult,                       approach, which in the hands of a skilled scientist of Salovey's                talent, will pay enormous dividends.",
