 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a framework                         within which more than one mathematical environmental                           model that simulates environmental processes can be used                        and the results rationally considered in determination of                       optimum solutions to environmental problems.  The                               specific, extensively mathematically modeled,                                   environmental issues the investigator plans to address                          include those characterizing sources and effects of acid-                       rain, those used in the implementation of surface water                         quality management procedures that allocate waste-loads,                        and the modeling of dose-response to low-levels of                              exposure to ionizing radiation.                                                                                                                                 Stochastic mathematical modeling of environmental problems                      in support of engineering design to address these problems                      has been traditionally based on the assumption that the                         simulation mechanics of the system are correct and the                          input is random.  This project is directed toward dealing                       with the uncertainties of the simulation model itself.                          Results of this project are expected to be utilized in                          improvement of the engineering design of environmental                          processes and systems for addressing and dealing with the                       impacts of pollutants on environmental resources of land,                       water and air.",
