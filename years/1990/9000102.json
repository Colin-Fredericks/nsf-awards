 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional forestry practices in the Northeast have led to                the dispersion of forest openings and scattered clear cuts                      throughout large regions.  The result is a fine-scaled mosaic of                young and older forests.  Such fragmentation has also created                   large amounts of \"edge\" habitat, purposefully constructed to                    boost populations of White-tailed Deer and other game species.                  These efforts have succeeded in boosting deer populations far                   beyond presettlement densities to the point where browsing by                   deer now appears to threaten plant species diversity by                         preventing the recruitment and regeneration of certain                          gymnosperms and associated herbaceous species.  We propose to use               existing long-term deer and plant survey data and the presence of               areas of reduced deer density to test hypotheses concerning the                 impacts of deer browsing on species diversity and community                     composition and dynamics.  We will also compare the size and age                structure and community composition of forest stands dominated by               Eastern Hemlock and White Cedar among areas that vary in deer                   density.  Finally, we will use experiments to test the direct and               indirect effects of deer browsing.  Results from this study are                 needed to document this new type of edge effect and to design                   practical patterns of forest use compatible with maintaining the                original species and community diversity of northern forests.                   Such analyses will allow implementation of appropriate                          conservation strategies.",
