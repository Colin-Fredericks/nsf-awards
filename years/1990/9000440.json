 "awd_abstract_narration": "Howard University has several researchers who would benefit from                access to supercomputers and access to other researchers                        connected to the NSFNET.  The campus will be connected with high                speed lines (1.5 million bits per second) to SURAnet, a mid-level               network which provides connectivity to the National Science                     Foundation Network, NSFNET, also through high speed communication               lines.                                                                          The proposal submitted by the Departments of Electrical                         Engineering and Systems and Computer Science also has the support               of the University Computing Services (UCS).  These groups are                   working together on the future development of a high capacity                   University.wide network.  The need for high speed computer links                is initially focussed on providing network speeds suitable for                  access to supercomputers for current and future demands of                      university researchers.  Support is requested for communications                equipment, communication lines, and partial defrayment of SURAnet               membership fees.",
