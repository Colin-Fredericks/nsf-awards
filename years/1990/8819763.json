 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Greif will investigate factors which help regulate the                      development of the sympathetic nervous system, using the rat                    superior cervical ganglion (SCG) as a model system.  The                        principal investigator will grow SCGs in a cell culture system,                 permitting a detailed analysis of how interactions between cells                across synaptic junctions can alter the biochemical development                 of neurons.                                                                                                                                                     Dr. Greif will study how the levels of two proteins associated                  with synaptic vesicles, which package neurotransmitters, are                    changed when cells are depolarized electrically or when cells are               grown in the presence of target tissue.  Once the patterns of                   response are determined, she will examine how such factors can                  signal a cell to alter its production of a protein.  She will                   focus on chemical signals found in cells known as \"second                       messengers\", which are important in regulating many cellular                    functions.  SCGs will be treated with agents which directly                     change the level of second messengers.  Dr. Greif will then study               how well such treatments can mimic the effects of electrical                    depolarization or other factors.  These studies will help us                    understand how cell-cell interactions can direct the normal                     development of the nervous system, and may provide important                    insights into factors responsible for disorders of neural                       development.",
