 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to significantly improve the teaching of              courses in construction materials and structural engineering                    analysis and design by utilizing modern testing and data                        processing equipment.  Specifically, a MTS 600 kip stationary                   universal testing machine and two DEC Vax Station 200 workstations              will be acquired.  The equipment will permit the testing of modern              high strength construction materials and can accommodate large-                 scale experiments on beams, columns and slabs to demonstrate                    physical concepts discussed in the classroom.  The workstations                 will be used in conjunction with the testing machine to allow the               students to compare effects of modelling assumptions in their                   theoretical analyses with results observed from experiments                     conducted simultaneously in the laboratory.                                                                                                                     Students planning to work in structural design or construction                  must obtain an understanding of the strength and behavior of the                materials and structures which they will deal with in their                     professional lives so that they can gauge the importance of their               analytical modelling decisions.",
