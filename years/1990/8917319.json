 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal described a United States - Peoples Republic                 of China multidisciplinary cooperative project in earth science.                The study involves three investigators from Stanford, two from                  Japan and 8 from China.  We wish to continue to conduct                         coordinated field-petrological-geochronological-tectonic                        investigations of Precambrian blueschist and eclogite belts in                  central China in order to constrain the genesis of these                        intracratonal blueschist belts.  Recent reports of many pre-                    Mesozoic-- even Precambrian -- blueschist belts in the PRC                      provide an excellent opportunity to test various hypotheses for                 blueschist facies metamorphism by establishing the tectonic and                 age relations of these occurrences.  Chinese colleagues have                    identified 4 probable Precambrian occurrences including a                       discontinuous, coherent blueschist belt more than 2000 km long in               central China and suggested its origin is related to deep fault                 systems.  Eclogites are abundant and some are associated with                   blueschists:  other lie within Archean gneiss terranes and                      contain relict coesite -- a high pressure polymorph of SiO2.                    Except for reconnaissance surveys, little is known about the                    phase petrology and mineral parageneses of Chinese blueschists                  and eclogites; available radiometric dating from Precambrian                    blueschist and eclogite metamorphism is ambiguous.  The proposed                U.S. China project will remedy these problems; it will involve                  systematic field observation, microprobe analyses of coexisting                 minerals + P-T-ometry, bulk XRF analyses of rocks and K-Ar, U-Pb,               Nd-Sm and Ar39/Ar40 age determinations.  Primary objectives are:                (1) to map the distribution and structural setting of blueschist                facies rocks and eclogites; (2) to determine mineralogical and                  chemical compositions of the metamorphic rocks; (3) to compare                  and contrast various types of eclogites; (4) to delineate mineral               paragenesis and P-T-time paths for blueschist and eclogite                      metamorphism; (5) to establish the ages of blueschist and                       eclogite metamorphism through radiometric dating; and (6) to                    elucidate the genetic relationship between recognized                           metamorphic, igneous and tectonic features.  The program should                 contribute to a much improved understanding of the genesis of                   intracratonal blueschists and eclogites and the complex geologic-               tectonic assembly of central China.  Our previous cooperative                   exchanges with Chinese geologists have been highly productive.                  Accelerated progress is anticipated because of the detailed                     groundwork and many preliminary petrological and field studies                  that have already been completed.",
