 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on two questions important to our                          understanding of the dynamics of convection on the Sun:                                                                                                              1)  Can the pattern of convection on the Sun's surface be                  attributed to the depth variation of the specific heat of the                   fluid, as its constituent gases become ionized?                                                                                                                      2)  How well can the nonlinear dynamics of the observed                    convection be represented by a smaller model involving                          interactions of only a few linear eigenmodes?  These questions                  will be addressed by a computer simulation involving code                       optimization for the parallel/vector environment at the Cornell                 National Supercomputer Facility; and the construction of a                      graphical interface for simulation data, which will provide a                   testing ground for advancing the state of the art in scientific                 visualization.  Special emphasis will be given to:                                                                                                                        (a)  incorporation of next-generation software for                                   interactive data rendering in three dimensions                             (b)  creation of modular, high-level (Unix/C) software                               tools that could be utilized by other researchers                               for building interfaces,                                                   (c)  operation of the interface over a network (with X                               Windows).",
