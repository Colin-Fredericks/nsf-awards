 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last several years techniques have been developed for                  the measurement of various magnetic properties of marine                        sediments.  Drs. King and Bloemendal have pioneered efforts to                  make these measurements on sediment cores both non-destructive                  and especially rapid.  Consequently, they have raised the                       technique to the level where it can be used like other, more                    traditional techniques that determine past climate and                          oceanographic changes.  The PI's will continue their previous                   investigations into the links between sediment composition and                  magnetic properties.  Their goals will be to determine fluxes                   of terrigenous sediment during the late Neogene, with special                   focus on the time of initiation of N. Hemisphere glaciation at                  about 2.5 Ma.  Soft sediments from IPOD/ODP cores and piston                    cores in the tropical eastern Atlantic, central North Atlantic,                 and the Arabian Sea will be measured, and with this variety of                  eolian, riverine and glacially derived terrigenoeus sediments                   they will: 1) explore the relationship between magnetic                         properties and the flux and grain-size of terrigenoeus                          sediments in these contrasting environments; 2) use these                       records to reconstruct the history of terrigeonous flux and                     climate in these three areas; and 3) perform laboratory                         experiments in conjunction with studies of selected core                        samples to determine the effects of reduction diagenesis and                    what magnetic criteria identify this process in soft sediments.",
