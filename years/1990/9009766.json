 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vector Quantization (VQ) is a source coding technique that                 is emerging as a fundamental component in many speech and video                 coding systems, particularly for low rate efficient transmission                over limited capacity communication channels.  The principal                    investigator is investigating and developing combined VQ and                    channel coding algorithms that substantially advance the current                performance achievable with respect to the overall reproduction                 quality of the signal in a narrowband channel or packet network                 environment.                                                                         In many applications limited bandwidth constraints make                    impractical the use of traditional channel coding techniques.                   The algorithms being studied will combine basic VQ compression                  techniques for voice and video applications with new channel                    coding schemes that use little or no redundancy information.                    The project will examine in depth and develop new source/channel                techniques for VQ, exploiting combined quantization and                         modulation, packet error recovery, index permutations, and                      selective bit protection.  In addition, a theoretical analysis of               the performance of VQ in the presence of channel noise for                      asymptotically high resolution quantizers is being studied, which               can lead to better understanding for quantizer design procedures.",
