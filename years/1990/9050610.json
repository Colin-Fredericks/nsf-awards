 "awd_abstract_narration": "The institution modernized two major instruments in the areas of                absorption and luminescence spectroscopy and created a central                  multi-functional laser laboratory for use in upper division                     teaching and student research.  Both instruments and the output                 from two laser light sources will be interfaced to the same central             microcomputer.  Capabilities in each of these spectroscopic                     techniques have been expanded to allow for computerized data                    acquisition and analysis for use in laboratory courses in physical              chemistry, instrumental analysis, polymers, special topics and                  independent/directed study as well as in departmental undergraduate             research projects.  The laser laboratory allows students to realize             and work with the unique capabilities of laser light sources.                   These include a He-Ne laser, a He-Cd laser and a nitrogen-pumped                dye laser in addition to associated optics, a monochrometer, a                  detection system and a microcomputer for experiment control and                 data analysis.  In the teaching labs novel absorption and                       luminescence measurements are made from continuous broad band                   sources and monochromated laser sources.  These are focused on                  physical and chemical properties in ways which more clearly                     elucidate optical effects in materials as well as illustrate the                power of modern optical techniques.  Independent study and research             projects involve experiment dealing with the spectroscopic                      illumination of laser dye materials in the solid state, as                      spectroscopic probes in surfactant and micelle based systems, and               in the pH dependent polymeric behavior of bioorganic ligand bonded              to lanthanides in association with EDTA.  The institution                       contributed to this project in an amount equal to the NSF funds.",
