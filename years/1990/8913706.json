 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Materials Research Group (MRG) Program of the               Division of Materials Research will support a multi-investigator,               multi-disciplinary research program at Purdue University on II-VI               semiconductors, diluted magnetic semiconductors (DMS), and their                sub-micron heterostructures.  The unique combination of                         semiconducting and magnetic properties exhibited by DMS substances              and the wide band gaps available in II-VI semiconductors offer                  long-term potential for new materials and technology.  The MRG                  activity at Purdue University is headed by Professors R.L. Gunshor              and A.K. Ramdas, and also involves the research group of Professor              J. Furdyna at Notre Dame.                                                                                                                                       Comprehensive materials preparation, design, and fabrication, as                well as a range of physical measurements and theoretical studies                will be carried out under the program.  These include                           spectroscopic studies (Raman, Brillouin, infrared,                              photoluminescence, piezo- and photo-modulated reflectivity);                    transmission electron microscopy; and Faraday effect and related                magneto-optic investigations.  Bulk crystals grown in the crystal               growth facility as well as sub-micron heterostructures grown in                 Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Atomic Layer Epitaxy facilities will be              specially prepared to address issues important in the context of                basic materials science and engineering, and with potential for                 leading to new technology and devices.  Collective and localized                excitations (vibrational, electronic, magnetic); the nature of the              interfaces in sub-micron heterostructures; the novel aspects of                 the excitations in the sub-micron structures; exchange                          interaction, magnetic ordering, and the physics of quantum wells                are illustrative examples of the wide range of physical problems                within the scope of the Purdue MRG activity.",
