 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a continuing and collaborative research effort with                     biologists on the hydrothermal emanations, primarily in Guaymas                 Basin, with follow up studies on material from the Northeastern                 Pacific (Middle Valley, Juan de Fuca and Gorda Ridges), African                 Rift Valley (Lake Tanganyika), and a hot spot under a continent                 (Yellowstone Park).  The organic matter (petroleum) brought to                  the seabed by hydrothermal circulation represents the rapidly                   generated pyrolytic products from organic detritus at depth and                 is a carbon source for the hemosynthetic food web.  This type of                carbon cycling and its geological fate will be studied in a                     sedimented rift system which is hydrothermally.active, receiving                primarily terrestrial organic detritus (Escanaba Trough).  This                 will be done by coupling organic and isotope geochemistry to                    examine interrelationships between post.depositional pyrolytic                  alteration of organic matter (petroleum),                                       biodegradation/weathering processes and chemosynthetic carbon                   fixation.  Chemical reactions (e.g. aromatization, dehydration,                 isomerization) with temperature constraints also will be studied                to define formation \"windows\" for different compound classes.                   The environmental fate of these compound classes will be examined               to assess solubility, oxidative weathering and biodegradation.                  Key reactions and processes will be simulated in the laboratory                 by hydrous pyrolysis experiments.  Carbon.14 dating of different                organic matter fractions will place constraints on the sources                  and subbottom depths of the alteration of carbonaceous materials.               Thus, molecular and isotopic signatures will be able to be used                 to trace the transfer of carbon from sources through these                      hydrothermal environments.",
