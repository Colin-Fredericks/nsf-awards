Because the                        Wets Spitsbergen Current).  Because the West Spitsbergen                        Current is the primary importer of ocean heat to the High                       Arctic, and is responsible for maintaining the sea-ice free                     conditions in the Norwegian Sea, detailed knowledge of the                      history of this current is critical to a complete                               understanding of the transition form the last glaciation to                     the present warm, interglacial climate state.  Thermohaline                     processes on the broad Arctic margin shelves play an                            important role in the thermohaline circulation of the Arctic                    Seas.  This project will examine whether the West                               Spitsbergen Continental Shelf was glaciated during the Last                     Glacial Maximum (approximately 18 thousand years ago).
