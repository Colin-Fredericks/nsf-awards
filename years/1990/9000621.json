 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site activity directly addressed the challenge of increasing           the enrollment of women and minorities in engineering graduate study.           The key aspects of this program are:                                            1) the active recruitment of minorities and women by visiting                      carefully selected \"target\" schools, and                                     2) a student oriented research program that contains social as well as             instructional aspects designed for successful integration of the                participants into an exciting research environment.                          Ten faculty members have volunteered to support recruitment,                    instruction, and research supervision. The projects offered span a              wide range of research, from plant tissue culture, to thermodynamics            held together by common chemical engineering principles.  REU                   participants will be matched with projects prior to selection to                maximize mutual interests and capabilities.  The participants will              enroll in a three credit undergraduate research course during the 1990          summer semester.  An instructional program at the beginning of the              program has been designed to give the students a quick start on                 research.  To stress the importance of communication, an introductory           final and oral presentation, as well as a final written report will be          required of each student.",
