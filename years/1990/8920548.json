 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professors Daniel Kevles and Leroy Hood of the California                       Institute of Technology have organized a seminar for the                        1989/1990 academic year to address issues of ethics and policy                  related to the human genome project.  The seminar will bring                    together faculty, research staff, and students associated with                  the new Science and Technology Center (STC) for Biotechnology                   with members and affiliates of the Caltech Program on Science,                  Ethics, and Public Policy, which is situated in the Humanities                  Division.  Specialists and humanists working on the genome                      project or concerned with the ethical issues surrounding it in                  the Los Angeles area will also participate.  With support from                  this grant, Professors Kevles and Hood will bring to Caltech                    outside speakers for eight sessions of this seminar.  The issues                to be examined at these seminars center on the ethical and policy               issues concerned with accomplishing the mapping and sequencing of               the genome and with the information that the genome project will                produce.  With respect to the issues surrounding the mapping and                sequencing of the genome, speakers will examine the implications                of the genome project for biology in general, including questions               of the pace and strategy of the project, its implications for the               allocation of R&D resources, prospects for international                        cooperation, and likely impact upon the conduct of biology.  With               respect to issues centering on the information produced by the                  project, speakers will address such concerns as \"ownership\" of                  the information and how the information is to be used.  It is                   vitally important that these kinds of issues be addressed by                    scientists and humanists who will play central roles in the                     development of the human genome project.  Working together to                   avoid the ethical quagmires which could beset this project, they                may increase public confidence in and support of the project.  As               the site of the STC for biotechnology, there is hardly a better                 place for such discussions to take place.",
