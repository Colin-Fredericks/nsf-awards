This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support five research                       projects in the Department Statistics of the University of North                Carolina at Chapel Hill: nonparametric estimation of boundaries:                finite-sample properties, research by Edward Carlstein;                         nonparametrics: theory and methodology, research proposed by                    Jianqing Fan; assessing variability and smoothing parameter                     selection in curve estimation, research proposed by J. Steven                   Marron; estimating distortion, research proposed by Gordon                      Simons; Environmental Time Series, research proposed by                         Richard Smith.",
