 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal grant to continue an investigation of                    climate variability as simulated by a low resolution atmospheric                general circulation model (GCM) coupled to interactive upper                    oceans formulations.  Both interannual and intra-annual aspects                 of the model climate will be examined.  The PIs will continue the               analysis of variability within two already completed 100 year                   seasonal integrations one performed with the atmospheric model                  coupled to a 50m deep upper ocean and the other performed with a                prescribed annual cycle of observed ocean conditions.  New                      experimental initiatives with more sophisticated upper ocean and                sea ice models are also proposed.  These involve 100 year                       seasonal integrations of the atmospheric model coupled to a                     prescribed variable depth upper ocean component, a prognostic                   mixed layer ocean formulation, a tropical-dynamical upper ocean                 model, and a improved sea ice parameterization.  The PIs will                   focus on characterizing the interannual variability of (1) ocean                surface temperature in tropical and extratropical latitudes of                  the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean and (2) sea ice area and thickness               in polar latitudes.  They will aim to identify cause/effect                     relationships between anomalies in different parts of the                       atmosphere-ice-ocean system.  The studies of intra-annual                       variability will focus on bimodality in planetary scale                         atmospheric circulation features of middle latitudes and on                     transition shifts in the seasonal structures of atmospheric                     circulation and energetic.  Intercomparison of the different                    experiments will identify the relative importance of individual                 ocean-atmospheric processes that produce climate variability.                   These processes include ocean-atmosphere energy                                 exchange,mechanisms involving mixed layer and sea ice                           development, and internal ocean dynamics.                                            This research is important because it seeks to improve                     understanding of how the ocean-ice-atmosphere system interacts to               cause climate variability.",
