 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's research interests are centered around the development and             application of tools for studying charge transport in semiconductor             materials.  Such tools are essential in the design and analysis of new          high performance device structures and in the study of basic device             phenomena.                                                                                                                                                      During the course of the PYI program, the PI's will demonstrate                 InP/InGaAs HBTs with collector structures optimized to show enhanced            or extended velocity overshoot effects which result from field                  profiling.  They will also upgrade their simulators to handle                   transport in the strained layer systems which are showing increased             promise for device applications.  The recent addition of Professors             Joe Campbell and Russ Dupuis to the Microelectronics Research Center            has provided a tremendous boost to their experimental HBT                       capabilities.  Dupuis's group will provide the MOCVD grown layers and           Campbell's group will assist in the high frequency measurement and              noise analysis of the HBTs designed and fabricated by the PI's group.                                                                                           An additional area of research which the PI plans to pursue during the          course of this program is the development of approaches to                      characterize barrier transport based on noise measurements.  This work          will involve both the development of a noise measurement simulator              (based on the Monte Carlo approach), and will also involve                      experimental characterization of the barrier transport and related              noise.  The experimental portion of this work will be done in                   collaboration with Professor Dean Neikirk (PYI 1986, Electrical                 Engineering).",
