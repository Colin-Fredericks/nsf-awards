 "awd_abstract_narration": "Working with Dr. Peter Galison, Dr. Stump is undertaking a                      postdoctoral fellowship to study and conduct research at                        Stanford University.  His research is centering on                              methodological issues surrounding new approaches to the                         philosophy of science which have arisen since the overthrow                     of logical positivism in the 1960's and 70's.  Philosophers                     of science are now paying close attention to the history of                     science and to current scientific practice.  The use of                         evidence from case studies can now be taken for granted as                      central to studies of scientific methodology.  There are,                       however, competing views on what to do with historical                          evidence even among philosophers of science who agree that                      such evidence is important and who reject the                                   incommensurability thesis (i.e. that advocates of a                             \"revolutionary\" scientific paradigm cannot meaningfully speak                   to advocates of the old paradigm because the theoretical terms                  they use have radically different, \"incommensurable\" meanings)                  associated with some anti-positivists.  Dr. Stump is examining                  three methodological positions:  Thomas Nickles view, \"local                    historicism,\"  Larry Laudan's reworking of epistemology,                        \"normative naturalism,\" and Ronald Giere's \"cognitive science                   of science.\"  Dr. Stump first is clearly formulating these                      positions, paying special attention to the issue of defining                    what is meant by \"local\" or context specific methodological                     rules.  The second issue he is exploring is how to test                         general and prescriptive rules from the historical record and                   current scientific practice.  The deep issue to be tested is                    whether any substantial methodological rules are legitimately                   universal or if all must remain context specific as the local                   historicists claim.  He is attempting to settle this question                   using case studies from the history of science and current                      scientific practice.",
