 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a three-day U.S.-Japan seminar                          entitled \"Processing, Microstructure Development, and Properties                of Advanced Ceramics and Their Composites.\"  Advanced ceramics                  have unique properties, with potential applications ranging                     from heat engines (high-temperature structural ceramics) to                     electric power transmission (new superconducting ceramics                       with high transition temperatures).  Their unique properties                    are not only due to their chemistry, bonding, and crystalline                   structure, but also to unique microstructures developed during                  their processing.  However, variability in the production of                    these microstructures during processing leads to considerable                   variability in the resulting ceramic materials.  The reliable                   utilization of structural and other advanced ceramics thus                      depends importantly on processing reliability.  Recent                          advances in the processing of ceramics, primarily by materials                  scientists in the U.S. and Japan, have pointed to new directions                for achieving reliable ceramics.  These advances will be                        discussed at the seminar by leading scientists in this field in                 the two countries.  The seminar will be held August 20-22,                      1990, near Tokyo, Japan.  Seminar co-organizers are Dr. Robert                  F. Davis, Department of Materials Science and Engineering,                      North Carolina State University; Dr. Shiushichi Kimura,                         Department of Inorganic Materials, Tokyo Institute of                           Technology; and Dr. Takashi Yamaguchi, Department of Science                    and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan.                                                                                                               Specific topical areas to be addressed at the seminar are                       powder science; precursor chemistries; new consolidation                        methods; densification and microstructure control;                              microstructure and mechanics; and joining, machining, and                       deformation.  The emphasis will be on exploring the                             interrelations of processing, microstructure, and properties                    of advanced ceramics and their composites.  It is expected that                 the discussions will also identify new research directions                      aimed toward improving processing reliability.",
