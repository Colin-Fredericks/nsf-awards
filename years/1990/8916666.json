 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pattern formation requires that cells have a unique positional                  value relative to their neighbors but positional value alone is                 not sufficient to account for the fine tuning of the patterns                   observed. The exquisitely precise organization of many cellular                 arrays demonstrates that cells are also oriented relative to                    their neighbors to form parallel arrays of structures and that                  this cellular orientation is linked to the overall organization                 of the body plan. This is most easily appreciated by considering                the organization of parallel arrays of cellular structures seen                 in many tissues such as the parallel orientation of hairs and                   bristles, the repeated orientation of the rhabdomeres of the eye,               and the polar organization of the cells of sensilla and the                     polarized induction of bracts by machrochate forming cells. In                  all these cases the microorganization of the cells of each                      structure is linked to the global orientation of the general body               plan. The mere existence of this level of organization implies a                mechanism of signals and receptors. In some way cells must                      receive not only positional cues but orienting cues that serve to               link their orientation to that of the general body plan. Dr.                    Marsh has been investigating the mechanisms whereby orienting                   information is transmitted to cells. He has surveyed a number of                mutants for affects on tissue organization and cell polarity. The               dishevelled gene appears to affect cell orientation in a global                 manner. He had found that dishevelled mutants affect orientation                of bract induction by bristle cells, orientation of hairs and                   bristles and organization of the rhabdomeres of the eye. He is                  proposing to clone and analyze the dishevelled locus.",
