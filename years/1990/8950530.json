 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Speech and Hearing               Sciences at the University of Arizona to acquire modern transducer              systems and two MacIntosh workstations to create virtual                        instruments to support three laboratory courses in communication                sciences.  The courses are SP H 260 - Speech Science, SP H 280 -                Hearing Science, and SP H 461 Instrumentation in Speech Science.                The transducer systems include (a) pneumotachographs, (b) an                    electroglottograph, and (c) magnetometers.  An additional                       transducer system will support the generation of high quality                   acoustical stimuli for laboratory exercises in auditory perception.             The core instrumentation, the computer workstations, will be                    configured with appropriate analog to digital and digital to analog             hardware to enable the students to obtain spectral analyses,                    fundamental frequency contours, and sound pressure level                        measurements of speech, and permanent written records of air                    pressure/flow, electroglottograph and magnetometer outputs, and                 electrophysiological signals.  The Hearing Science laboratories                 will employ the instrumentation in adaptive psychophysical                      protocols to enable the students to investigate auditory perception             using modern methods.  The virtual instruments and transducers will             replace dedicated apparatus that is aging, unsupported, and                     unadaptable to modern, computer-based data collection and analysis              methods.  The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal                   sources.",
