Central to the realization of these goals is the                      integration, throughout the curriculum, of design, broadly                      conceived -- that is, of engineering design in all its diversity,               from technical to social dimensions -- and the development of                   programs to attract and retain women and underrepresented                       minorities in engineering.  The grantee provides funds for this                 project that are more than an equal match for the NSF award.",
