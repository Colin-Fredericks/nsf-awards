 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the planning of an enlarged                  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) on                     Material Handling, Packaging and Processing.  It would be in                    furtherance of one of the goals the I/UCRC Program, namely to                   increase the scope and depth of research at I/UCRC's by encouraging             the formation of multi-university consortia.  The University of                 Cincinnati, the University of Arkansas, and Florida Atlantic                    University each have expertise which can be added synergistically               to that at the I/UCRC at the Georgia Institute of Technology to                 form a \"national\" center.                                                            Material Handling, packaging, and processing are a major cost              element in both discrete product and process industries as well as              the distribution and transportation of goods.  The selective                    automation of these tasks promises both economic and social                     benefits, such as lower service and manufacturing costs, higher                 product quality and fewer employee injuries.  The research topics               to be addressed at such a center include:  automated pelletizing;               bin-picking; bin-packing; high speed/volume packing; unit load                  forming/cargo loading; simulation models for packaging and                      processing; shipping/logistics; automated kithing; carton                       standardization; new concepts for warehouse design; and design of               versatile grippers.  Industries which would be affected by the                  research performed at this type of center are:  food distribution               centers; freight companies; the U.S. Postal Service; machine                    tool/equipment manufacturers; and the U.S. military and their                   contractors.                                                                         A grant of $75,000 for one year is recommended for award to                the University of Cincinnati.",
