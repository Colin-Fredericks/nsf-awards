 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will utilize numerical simulation to address the                  influence of end-walls on the flow in the space                                 between eccentric rotating cylinders.  The common belief that                   such effects disappear when the end-walls are sufficiently far                  apart is called into question by results developed through                      earlier results by these researchers, who focus on the                          development of instabilities in this flow.  The present study                   will generalize and systematize the role of end-walls in                        structuring the possible instability modes which may occur.                                                                                                     The configuration to be studied is representative of flows in                   certain types of bearings and other tribological systems,                       where instabilities may cause unanticipated dynamics and loss                   of efficiency.",
