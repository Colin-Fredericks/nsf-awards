Using the theme of the Physics of the Earth's                         Environment, we will offer three-week Young Scholars                            Institutes for bright girls from rural schools in Nebraska.                     Each institute will introduce the girls to basic physical                       science and mathematics concepts and computer technology                        through practical hands-on activities.  On completing her                       first science institute, each girl will be provided with a                      personal computer and modem, and linked to a state-wide                         electronic bulletin board.  Institute staff will provide                        ongoing mentoring through frequent contact with each girl.                      The entering ninth grade girls will do instructional and                        research projects related to The Physics of the Solid Earth.                    in the second summer the entering tenth grade girls will do                     instructional and research projects related to The Physics of                   Earth's Water.  The girls' parents and teachers will be                         involved in the project through workshops and conferences.",
