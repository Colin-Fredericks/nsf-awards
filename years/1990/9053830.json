It involves a public                         university, a regional school system, and local industries.                     The project will establish an on-going career development                       path for teachers by providing them an introduction to                          selected high priority technical areas, using a combination                     of tutorial sessions and participation in research and                          workshops.  At the heart of the project is a six week                           concentrated summer workshop and research experience,                           followed by complementary activities in the ensuing academic                    year.  A team of engineers and scientists drawn from the                        participating institutions will be responsible for the                          tutorial sessions and supervision of research and workshop                      activities.  In order to broaden and sustain its impact, the                    project staff will create a system of mentors and resource                      persons at the school level to assist teachers in the                           translation of their program experiences into effective                         educational modules and other teaching resources which will                     lead to measurable curricular upgrading.",
