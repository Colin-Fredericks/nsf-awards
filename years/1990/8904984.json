 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trivalent arsenical reagents interact specificially with proteins               bearing vicinal sulfhydryl groups, forming very stable cyclic                   dithioarsenite complexes.  Such complexes are inactive if the                   sulfhydryl groups are critical catalytic or regulatory elements.                Ubiquitin (Ub) is a small and highly-conserved polypeptide whose                ligation to other cellular proteins can bring about protein                     degradation.  In some cases, Ub ligation may also serve to                      regulate protein function.  Trivalent arsenicals have been found                to inhibit two enzymes involved in Ub protein ligation. One of                  these, a Ub carrier protein (E2-230K), directly catalyzes Ub                    conjugation to proteins.  The other is an aminoacyl-tRNA protein                transferase.  Amino-terminal arginylation catalyzed by the                      transferase renders proteins substrates for Ub ligation.  The                   proposed research addresses the mechanistic and structural                      implications of inhibition of these enzymes by trivalent                        arsenicals.  The experiments will reveal whether inhibition is                  indeed mediated by interaction of arsenicals with vicinal                       sulfhydryls, and will also address how this structural element,                 if present, functions in catalysis and/or regulation.  This                     research addresses basic issues concerning catalytic mechanism                  and specificity in Ub-protein ligation, and may also lead to                    development of better and more specific inhibitors.",
