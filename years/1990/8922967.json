 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most materials exhibit slow fluctuations, with a broad                          distribution of characteristic rates, in a variety of electrical,               mechanical, magnetic, and optical parameters.  Despite the                      ubiquity of a simple form (1/f) for the frequency spectrum of                   such fluctuations, a wide variety of mechanisms are involved, as                has been demonstrated in past experiments.  These fluctuations                  are of interest for two general reasons.  First, they limit the                 performance of a variety of sensors and devices.  Second, they                  provide a useful tool to study fundamental properties of                        materials, especially the poorly understood types of materials                  known as glasses, which exhibit partially frozen random                         structures.  They are using electrical, optical and magnetic                    fluctuation techniques to investigate ordinary glasses, glassy                  metals, spin glasses, magnetic materials with random domain                     structures, and other systems.  Their particular focus is on how                frozen random structures emerge from fluid random structures as                 temperature is lowered, and on what type of unfrozen modes remain               at very low temperatures.",
