 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award will purchase a portable micro-                computer, printer, and supplies to aid the research of an                       anthropology graduate student in Jamaica.  The student's research               is also supported by a Wenner-Gren and a Fulbright award.  The                  project is to analyze the interactions between men and women in a               relatively new \"Family Court\" run by the Jamaican government to                 assure child support.  Using participant observation, analysis of               court records and detailed case studies, interviews and cognitive               tests, and birth registration data, the student will analyze how                this recent legal structure is affecting gender relations.  The                 project will study how the definition of \"father\" is changing in                response to these new laws, and whether the changing legal                      definition of out-of-wedlock infants has affected the felt                      responsibilities of men and women towards marriage and children.                                                                                                The increase in children born out of wedlock is dramatic in many                countries in the world.  Increased understanding of how legal                   structures affect young people's values and behavior will help                  planners cope with these changing social patterns.",
