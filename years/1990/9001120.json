 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plain Titmouse (Parus inornatus) varies in overall size,               bill size, and color throughout its range in western North                      America.  Ten geographic forms are currently recognized (American               Ornithologists' Union, 1957, Check-list of North American Birds)                on the basis of morphology and color.  West of the Cascade-Sierra               Nevada Mountains, the species occurs commonly in foothill oak                   woodland.  Density is lower in the Southwest and Intermountain                  Regions, where populations are found patchily in pinyon-juniper                 or juniper habitat.  The goal of this project is to integrate                   morphologic, molecular, and behavioral data on Parus inornatus in               order to elucidate patterns and processes of divergence among                   populations.  Differences in population structure will enable                   testing of alternative models of gene flow.  Hypotheses                         concerning the role of adaptation and Pleistocene isolation also                will be evaluated.                                                                   A variety of modern systematic techniques will be used to                  examine patterns of morphologic and genetic variation within and                among populations of Parus inornatus.  Results to date indicate                 strong genetic differentiation between Pacific slope and                        Intermountain populations, on the order of that found between                   closely related species of birds.  Patterns of variation in                     morphology (especially bill size and shape) and color support the               genetic data.  A quantitative estimate of gene flow will shed                   light on the process of genetic and morphologic divergence among                populations.  Because numerous bird species show similar patterns               of divergence between the Pacific slope and Intermountain                       Regions, this study will contribute to an emerging picture of                   avian speciation in western North America.  The results of this                 study will likely lead to formal taxonomic changes by the                       American Ornithologists' Union Committee on Classification and                  Nomenclature.  The identification of genetically and/or                         morphologically distinct populations will provide critical                      information for managers concerned with the protection and                      management of pinyon-juniper or oak woodlands in the western                    United States.  The future of oak woodlands in California is of                 growing concern because of increasing pressures for development                 in the foothills of the Cascade-Sierra, Nevada and Coast Ranges.",
