 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in materials                     between Dr. Stephen Nagler, University of Florida and                           Professor Roger Cowley, Department of Physics, University of                    Oxford. The objective of the project is an investigation of                     metastable effects associated with incommensurate                               charge density waves in potassium blue bronzes.                                                                                                                 Metastability associated with phase transitions is a topic of                   broad current interest in statistical physics.  The many                        related problems include ordering kinetics near first order                     phase transitions, and random field systems. Potassium blue                     bronze is a particularly interesting material, exhibiting                       non-linear conductivity, slow structural changes in response                    to applied fields, and defect induced irreversibility.  The                     proposed project is an investigation of potassium blue                          bronze, using time-resolved-x-ray scattering. Questions to be                   addressed include the possible structural origins of unusual                    time dependent resistivities in irradiated potassium blue                       bronze, and the relationship of defects to the structural                       response to an applied electric field. Two principal                            experiments will be performed.  In the first experiment the                     response of the system to an applied field at low temperatures                  will be examined in samples with a wide range of induced                        effects.  In the second experiment, the same samples will be                    utilized to examine the possibility that the 90 K hysteresis                    in the resistivity is coupled to a non-equilibrium wave-                        vector.  Measurements on a series of sample with different                      levels of defects induced by irradiation should provide much                    important information on the true role of defects and                           pinning in the field induced disordered state.  This project                    will benefit from the complementary expertise of the two                        investigators.  Dr. Nagler has extensive experience in the                      areas of phase transition, low dimensional non-linear and                       non-equilibrium systems studies by x-ray and neutron                            scattering.  Dr. Cowley's background is in the application of                   neutron and x-ray scattering to the study of condensed                          matter, especially phase transitions.",
