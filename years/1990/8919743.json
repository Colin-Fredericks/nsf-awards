 "awd_abstract_narration": "The retina at the back of the eyeball is the tissue containing                  the photoreceptors and sensory nerve cells that allow vision.                   The molecules that absorb light energy and initiate vision are                  photopigments; they are made from proteins combined with                        compounds called retinoids, which have molecular structures                     related to vitamin A.  The immediate environment of the                         photoreceptor cells is the interphotoreceptor matrix, which has a               complex structure in the vertebrates, and is a region important                 for retinal physiology, including exchange processes with                       circulatory fluids.  One group of invertebrate animals, the                     cephalopods, includes squid and octopus with eyes strikingly                    similar to those in the vertebrates, but with some aspects such                 as the vitamin-A cycle that seem simpler.  We have some knowledge               for the vertebrates on how the retinoids are  transported in the                blood to the retina, and how they are taken  up by the                          photoreceptors to form photopigments.  But we know little about                 whether or not these results are generalizable to the wide                      diversity of visual systems in other animal classes.  This study                will utilize biochemistry and electron microscopy on octopus                    retina to identify the presence and location of cellular receptor               sites on the photoreceptors for binding retinoids.  The                         substructure of the interphotoreceptor matrix also will be                      studied by staining techniques.  These data will provide the                    first data on these important features of invertebrate eyes, and                will be important to compare to the known features of the                       vertebrate eye.  The inclusion of undergraduates including                      minorities in this technically modern and productive laboratory                 will have a very high impact on the recruitment and retention of                young scientists in this field.",
