 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of natural 222Rn and deliberately introduced SF6           can be used to accurately detect and quantify groundwater delivery              to stream flow.  Experiments, involving the simultaneous                        measurement of 222RN and SF6 will be conducted in the Santa Fe River            in Florida.  The detection of anomalously high levels of 222Rn in the           stream will permit the identification of locations of groundwater               input.  The observed variations between SF6 and 222Rn will be used to           determine accurate gas exchange rates, which are needed to estimate             the groundwater component of surface discharge.  The rate of gas                exchange, which can be expressed as a reaeration coefficient, is                also a determining factor in assessing water quality in a stream.               Thus, the measurement of 222Rn and SF6 together will yield another              geochemical technique for assessing the water quality of aquatic                systems.                                                                             Measurements of the D/H and 180/160 ratios in water samples                collected from the Sante Fe during a 222Rn survey following a major             precipitation event when the difference between the precipitation               derived surface runoff and the well integrated groundwater                      component is maximized will provide an independent check on                     estimates of groundwater delivery based on the 222Rn data.                           The proposed research will benefit hydrologists and water                  resource managers by establishing a powerful new geochemical                    technique for examining the interconnections between groundwater                and surface flow.  In addition, the research will provide a                     hydrologic and water quality data base not easily obtained by                   conventional methods.",
