 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Robert Zeitlin and                a student assistant will conduct archaeological research at the                 site of Laguna Zope, located on the west coast of Mexico about                  200 km from the valley of Oaxaca.  Extensive work in Oaxaca has                 demonstrated the rise, subsequent expansion, and final decline of               a powerful Zapotec civilization, and Dr. Zeitlin's research in a                adjacent area will provide insight into the extent and nature of                Zapotec expansion.  Laguna Zope consists of a large site with                   dense, stratified cultural deposits which originally covered                    approximately 85 hectares.  These result from hundreds of years                 of continuous occupation.  A road which runs through the site                   truncates these deposits, and Dr. Zeitlin, working from the cut                 face, will excavate into these strata in a mound area, indicative               of high status occupation.  The ceramics and other materials                    collected will permit examination of Zapotec interaction.  Faunal               and floral materials will allow reconstruction of subsistence                   techniques.                                                                                                                                                     Kingdoms and empires appear to have arisen independently in many                areas of both the Old and New World.  Archaeologists wish to                    understand the processes which lead to the growth of such complex               societies and which can eventually incorporate millions of                      individuals.  In particular, it is unclear how outlying regions                 are brought under the domination of the core area and several                   mechanisms, from direct conquest to the fostering of economic                   dependence, have been proposed.  Laguna Zope, because of its                    peripheral position and rich readily accessible cultural                        deposits, provides an excellent situation to address this                       question.                                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons.  It will                        contribute to our understanding of how complex societies,                       including our own, arise.  Because development is rapidly                       destroying the site, these data would otherwise soon be lost.                   Finally, the project will assist in the training a graduate                     student.",
