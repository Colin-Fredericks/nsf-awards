 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to investigate the effects of three types of                    coffee cultivation on the native insect fauna associated with the               area.  Preliminary planning activities include:  literature review,             site location, necessary permissions and collaborating                          institutions, experimentation with methodologies, preliminary data              gathering, data analysis and interpretation, experiment redesign                and writing of final proposal.  Activities during the first year                will involve the comparison of 3 management systems:  1)                        Traditional agroforestry system with a variety of shade trees                   interplanted with coffee; 2) the agroforestry system with just one              shade tree species intensively managed through periodic pruning;                and 3) monocultural coffee with no shade tree.  Representative                  farms will be selected.  Base-line data related to ant                          assemblages, insect pest and disease densities and distributions                will be gathered using standard sampling methods.  Photon flux                  density and CO2 uptake will be calculated directly using the                    Solarcal computer program.  Satellite photographs will be used to               determine the area of the country planted in the monocultural                   system.  The effect of nitrogen fertilization and the effect of                 pesticide insecticide applications on the ant assemblage and on                 pests will be studied in subsequent years.",
