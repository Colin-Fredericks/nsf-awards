Smith of Arizona State University and F. Stephen                                Dobson of Auburn University .. and Wang Xuegao of                               the Northwest Plateau Institute of Biology, Chinese                             Academy of Sciences.  This institute is located in                              the city of Xining in the Qinghai.Xizang (Tibetan)                              Plateau.                                                                                                                                                        Direct observation of the number of offspring                                   produced in a lifetime by each member of a known                                set of individuals, or \"Lifetime Reproductive                                   Success (LRS)\" is an important measure indicating                               fitness differences between the sexes or among                                  individuals that live under different social or                                 ecological conditions.  Studies of LRS are                                      essential for a broad understanding of adaptation                               in a social context.  Professors Smith and Dobson                               will measure LRS for a natural population of                                    black.lipped pikas (\u001aOchotona\u001a \u001acurzoniae\u001a), small                              mammals related to rabbits that inhabit alpine                                  meadows on the                                                                  Qinghai.Tibetan Plateau.  Black.lipped pikas                                    present a model system for such an investigati\u001aon                               because:  1) high mortality rates cause a nearly                                complete annual turnover in the population; 2) high                             population density ensures a large number of                                    cohesive families (the primary social unit); 3)                                 most environmental factors associated with LRS can                              be easily measured; 4) among families a variety of                              mating systems (monogamy, polygyny, polyandry) are                              simultaneously present; and 5) these mating systems                             are formed annually during a short episode of male                              dispersal, and once formed each family mating                                   system remains stable throughout the year.  These                               characteristics allow for contrast of LRS between                               males and females concurrently occupying different                              mating systems.",
