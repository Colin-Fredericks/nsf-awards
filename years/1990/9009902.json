 "awd_abstract_narration": "Datalog, also known as database logic, is one of the simplest                   formalisms that can be used to write rule-based programs;                       intuitively, Datalog is Prolog without function symbols.                        Datalog is the language of choice to write knowledge-based                      applications, by adding rules to a relational database system.                  However, to be able to use this formalism efficiently, the                      optimization problem of Datalog programs must be solved.                        To solve this problem it is desirable to be able to detect when a               recursive database logic program is bounded, that is, whether the               program is equivalent to a nonrecursive one. This is a central                  issue in the optimization of Datalog programs. This research                    project is concerned with the characterization of some classes of               bounded Datalog programs when the relational database is                        consistent with respect to some constraints. The constraints                    considered in this research are functional dependencies.                        This research project provides a methodology for more efficient                 query processing in knowledge-base systems that are being built                 as extensions of relational database systems. This in turn makes                such knowledge-base systems more feasible for use in practice.",
