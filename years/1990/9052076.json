 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital signal processing chips (DSPs) have recently appeared in                many products.  Also, computer-aided design (CAD) workstations are              increasing engineering productivity while, at the same time,                    altering the way the engineering designs.  Today's electrical                   engineers should be familiar with DSP hardware, software, and                   related CAD tools.  A DSP laboratory facility is proposed that will             permit students to practice both software and \"chip-level\" DSP-                 based hardware design using modern CAD tools.  This facility will               serve students in three ways:  (1)  It will support a new DSP                   project course, (2) it will permit the assignment of basic DSP                  simulation homework in the existing DSP theory course, and (3) it               will support DSP-related senior design projects.  This facility                 will consist of ten DSP workstations.  Each workstation includes:               (1) a Zenith 80386-based personal computer, (2) a DSP board that                plugs into the PC, (3) associated CAD tools, and (4) a reusable                 hardware design prototyping kit.  The unique features of our                    approach are:  (1) the use of CAD tools (2) the emphaise on \"chip-              level\" hardware design as well as software design, and (3) the                  interdisciplinary manner in which we propose to structure the                   student project teams.  The institution is contributing an amount               equal to the award.***//",
