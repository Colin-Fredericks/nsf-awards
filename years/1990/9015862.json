 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a renewed interest in the theoretical and                   experimental analysis of pattern and process during succession.                 Although much current research focuses on mechanistic processes                 causing successional change, hierarchy theory allows us to                      explore patterns and their causes at any spatial scale of                       interest.  The purpose of this research is to analyze the                       complexity of successional trajectories in phase-space                          ordination.  The P.I.'s propose to use ordination methods such as               canonical correspondence analysis to construct successional                     vectors in phase-space.  The complexity of the successional                     trajectories in phase-space can be measured using fractals.  The                P.I.'s will analyze the complexity of succession in three sets of               field data:  ten long term plots at Hutcheson Memorial Forest,                  New Jersey, (2) two samples of a chronosequence at Cedar Creek                  Natural History Area, Minnesota, and (3) eight long-term plots                  from the Rothamstad Park Grass Experiment, Harpenden, UK. In                    addition, they will use ZELIG, a spatially explicit forest                      succession simulation model (available to us through the Konza                  Prairie Long-term Ecological Research site), to simulate forest                 succession at different spatial scales.  From the model output,                 they can determine the effects of spatial scale and time interval               between samples on the measurement of complexity during                         succession.  In addition, they can compare patterns of complexity               in the model output to patterns in the field data.  The methods                 described in this proposal go beyond the traditional individual-                population-community hierarchy to provide a unique approach for                 analyzing and describing complex patterns in plant community                    dynamics.  Further development of such model will provide                       important insights into change currently taking place in the                    environment.",
