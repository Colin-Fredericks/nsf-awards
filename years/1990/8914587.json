 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to develop computing infrastructure for             research in four primary areas:  parallel program design tools,                 development of a CAD design system, distributed database design, and            visual texture perception.  The new infrastructure includes the                 development of a more powerful UNIX environment, the upgrading of               parallel processing capability, the acquisition of a number of                  workstations, and the provision of hardware and software technicians.                                                                                           The parallel program design tools research focuses on the design of             various tools to assist in the development of parallel programs.  One           aspect is the design of kernel-level mechanisms for distributed real-           time programs.  Another is the design of operating system mechanisms to         support different kinds of parallel programming paradigms.  A third             aspect is the development of techniques for the static analysis of              parallel programs, including deadlock detection.                                                                                                                The CAD design system research focuses on the development of a                  constraint driven, multi-level CAD design system.  This system includes         CAD tools to support high-level architectural design, behavioral                synthesis, logic synthesis, and layout generation.  Synthesis for               performance is an emphasis.                                                                                                                                     Distributed database design research is concerned with two issues in            the design of distributed databases.   The first is the design and              analysis of highly available databases.  Replication methods to                 tolerate site and communication failures are being explored.  Database          design using robust data structures to tolerate an intermediate level           of faults, including software faults and partial media failures is also         being investigated.  The second issue is the development of a                   distributed database system using an object mode.                                                                                                               Visual texture perception research is concerned with visual texture             perception in humans and machines.  The trade-offs of using different           types of filters as the front-end for the texture discrimination module         in a machine vision system are being explored.  VLSI-appropriate                architectures for various problems in machine vision are also being             studied.  Some of these architectures will be prototyped using the CAD          tools developed above.",
