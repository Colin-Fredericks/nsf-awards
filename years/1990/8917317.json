 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research planned in this proposal will address the question                 of why black mother-only families and their offspring are more                  likely to experience long term welfare dependence.  The                         investigator is proposing to look at the way in which internal                  family dynamics interact with stressors in the environment                      among a group that is presently being referred to as the                        underclass.  The objective of this study has major theoretical                  implications, because it will address the current controversy                   over what social, economic, and environmental mechanisms are                    responsible for the persistence of welfare dependence.  The                     investigator feels that the findings from such a study will                     facilitate the development of more social and clinical                          interventions and policy prescriptions for unmarried black                      mothers with children living in areas of concentrated poverty.                  As a prelude to preparing a full proposal, the investigator                     plans to engage in an intensive review of the subject area,                     consult with experts in the field of study, and enroll in                       courses in quantitative methods.",
