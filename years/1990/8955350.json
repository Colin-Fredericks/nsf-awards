The purpose is to lead the visitors from the perceived               complexities of our surroundings to an unperceived simpler features of          the subnuclear world.  The collaborators propose to develop two                 duplicate copies of eight exhibits, with one copy for display at each of        the two institutions.  They also look to making the plans available to          other science centers inexpensively and on a copyright-free basis.  An          added feature of the project is the collaboration between the Center of         Science and Industry, an established science center, and the Science and        Technology Interactive Center, an emerging one.",
