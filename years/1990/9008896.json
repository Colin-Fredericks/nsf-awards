 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate genetic divergence and                      phylogenetic relationships among species of the owl monkey,                     Aotus.  Owl monkeys are widely distributed in Central and South                 America.  Until ten years ago it was generally assumed that owl                 monkeys comprised a single species, A. trivirgatus.  More                       recently, however, it has been suggested that the owl monkey                    represents at least ten allopatric species which have distinct                  geographic distributions and can be distinguished both                          phenotypically and genotypically.  Aotus has undergone an                       extraordinary amount of karyotypic change with diploid chromosome               counts ranging from 46 to 58, but changes in other genetic                      characters have not yet been investigated.  This research will                  examine mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and several related gene                      sequences within and among several karyotypically distinct                      species.  This work is important because of the use of the owl                  monkey as a model for malarial research, and because of the                     unusual nature of chromosomal rearrangements in this genus.",
