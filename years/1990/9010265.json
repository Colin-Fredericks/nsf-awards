 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the effect of cultural factors, social                  ties, and short-term population mobility (such as daily shopping                and visiting) in the spread of parasitic disease on the island of               Dominica in the Lesser Antilles, West Indies.  Methods involve                  the development and analysis of mathematical models.  The                       movement of individuals in the course of their daily activities                 is an important aspect of human behavior.  Since most human                     illness is spread by direct or indirect human contact, population               mobility is a critical factor involved in its spread between                    regions.  Previous research on population movements has                         concentrated on large-scale permanent migrations, often because                 of better labor markets in new areas.  Although this kind of                    mobility has proven useful in explaining global patterns of                     disease spread during human history, it is not of use in                        explaining its every-day occurrence.  Short-term mobility is far                more important for this problem because it is more common and                   because long stays in an area are not required in order for                     transmission to occur.  This project will provide quantitative                  data on the nature of such mobility and its importance for the                  spread and maintenance of disease in an area.  While a major                    focus of this study is the ultimate utilization of these data in                epidemiology, the study itself is anthropological in nature and                 draws on the importance of social ties among kin and non-kin, and               the significance of population mobility in a market-based                       economy.",
