Examples of projects to be supported by the requested                           equipment are: 1) development of improved bioreactors and                       operating strategies for production of proteins and                             insecticides from the insect cell-baculovirus system; 2)                        testing of mathematical models that predict responses in                        cellular physiology to alterations in culture conditions;                       3) development of cell-culture analogs to pharmokinetic                         models for the purpose of improved risk assessment with                         respect to potentially toxic chemicals; 4) model studies                        on the dynamics of receptor-mediated cell adhesion; 5)                          development ofan experimental model of cell adhesion to                         blood vessels to preventmetastasis or the spread of tumor                       cells from one organ within the body, using metastatic cell                     lines; and 6) the development of biomaterials for culture                       of attachment-dependent cell lines to improve bioreactor                        performance.",
