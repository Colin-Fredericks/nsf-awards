 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fourth International Workshop on Plant Mitochondria                         continues a series of informal and interactive gatherings for                   researchers in the fields of plant mitochondrial genetics,                      biochemistry, physiology and molecular biology.  This Workshop                  is the only forum for a large number of researchers in the field                to interact.  The format requires that all attendees present                    either a poster and/or a short talk, thus maximizing their                      degree of participation.  The specific objectives of the                        Workshop are to provide an informal atmosphere for the exchange                 of ideas and current data, to facilitate and encourage the                      establishment and continuation of existing scientific                           collaborations, and to hold concurrent workshops on specialized                 topics and thus to identify critical research objectives in the                 understanding of mitochondrial function and biogenesis.  The                    Workshop will be at Cornell University, where there is active                   research in plant organelle molecular biology, biochemistry and                 transformation.  Several significant advances have occurred                     since the last Workshop, including the discovery of RNA editing                 in plant mitochondria, mitochondrial transformation and the                     complete sequence analysis of a plant mitochondrial genome.                     The upcoming Workshop promises to be the most scientifically                    stimulating to date, and has already attracted widespread                       interest including inquiries or accepted invitations from nearly                100 scientists from 15 countries.",
