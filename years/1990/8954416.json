 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chautauqua Program is providing an annual series of workshops in            which scholars at the frontiers of various sciences and engineering meet        intensively for several days with undergraduate college science and             engineering faculty.  These workshops are providing an opportunity for          invited scholars to communicate new knowledge, concepts, and techniques         directly to college faculty in ways which are immediately beneficial to         their teaching.  The primary aim is to enable undergraduate faculty in          the sciences and engineering to keep their teaching current and                 relevant.                                                                                                                                                       The program is national in scope and is benefiting large numbers of             undergraduate faculty (1900 participants in the first year, 2125 in the         second year, and 2,375 in the third year).  This national program is            helping in attracting and maintaining an adequate supply of graduates in        science, mathematics and engineering.                                                                                                                           The participants and the various universities involved in the program           are funding the majority of the costs of the program.  NSF is providing         decreasing funds over the three year period to cover recruitment,               development, and the Advisory Committee.",
