 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a Research                   Training Group in Studies of Paleorecords of Global Change.  The                faculty group is a mixture of outstanding senior and junior                     investigators who come from a variety of disciplines.  The funds                will provide stipends for graduate students and postdoctoral                    fellows, will support research participation by high school and                 undergraduate students, will defray part of the cost of the                     trainees' research and will enable the trainees to attend                       scientific meetings.  In addition, funds will be used to purchase               specialized research equipment to be used by trainees, and to bring             investigators from other research and academic institutions to the              Minnesota campus for workshops and symposia.                                                                                                                    There is now a significant need for the training of new researchers             skilled in study of the environment.  The use of new techniques                 taken from a variety of physical and biological disciplines is                  revolutionizing studies both of the environment and of its                      variation over the course of time.  The quantitative analysis of                past changes in the environment, including the study of particular              ecosystems and their response to environmental stress, is of                    particular relevance to the current concerns about global change.",
