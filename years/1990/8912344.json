 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research activity in astronomy and astrophysics at Columbia                     University has recently undergone a major expansion with the                    allocation of substantial new resources to the Departments of                   Physics and Astronomy:  Nine new faculty members have been hired                during the past five years, over $2 million has been spent or                   committed for building renovation and another $0.4 M has been                   awarded in startup money for the new faculty.  In addition, the                 University has agreed to allot $320,000 in 2:1 matching funds                   toward the purchase and installation of a modern computing facility             to support the varied research programs of its young faculty.  This             award provides the remaining 1/3 of the funds required to complete              the acquisition of this system.  Major science projects which                   necessitate the CONVEX-based facility are already underway; these               include a complete volume-limited HI survey fo the Hydra cluster                of galaxies and a number of other large aperture synthesis spectral             line projects conducted by the PI, a survey of the Galactic plane               at 327 MHz which exceeds all previous surveys be a factor of more               than 30 in both resolution and sensitivity, analysis of several                 hundred echelle spectra of K giants and extensive crowded-field                 photometry in the Galactic bulge as part of a larger program                    directed at unravelling the chemical and dynamical evolution of the             Galaxy, analysis of other extensive data sets including                         high-resolution optical spectra of white dwarfs, emission line                  regions of active galactic nuclei, and quasar absorption line                   systems, and several theoretical projects related to time-dependent             convection in stars, numerical studies in the formation and                     evolution of galaxies, and the investigation of a novel approach                to thermal instabilities in the interstellar medium.  The research              computing facility is essential for the conduct of much of this                 research program.",
