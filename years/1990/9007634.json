This is a eighth in a series of meetings                     on finite elements methods in water resources which is                          being broadened starting with this meeting.  The problem                        areas to be covered include; groundwater flow, flow in                          lakes and estuaries, remote sensing, environmental                              systems analysis and optimization, and salt-water                               intrusion.  Significant effort have been expended in                            attracting leading international researchers to                                 complement the broad focus of this meeting.  This is the                        major conference focusing on the computational-                                 mathematical-water resources interface and this action                          provides partial travel and per-diem support for U.S.                           invited speakers, organizers, and student participants.                         The conference is being hosted by the Dipartimento di                           Metodi e Modelli Matematica per le Scienze Applicate,                           Universita degli Studi Padova.                                                                                                                                  In addition to the traditional presentations, this                              conference will include two forums in which the                                 participants have been invited to solve \" standard                              problems\" in Supercomputing in Water Resources and                              Wave Propagation in Shallow Waters.  The purpose is to                          provide a systemic comparison of different numerical                            solution methods for problems difficult but important to                        water resources applications.",
