 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of electrogenerative processes, i. e.                           processes for producing chemical products with byproduct                        electric power.  The emphasis in this study is on electrodes                    for electrogenerative processing of substrates dissolved in a                   liquid phase.  Methods for formulating and preparing the                        requisite electrocatalysts to optimize the selectivity are                      investigated.  Selected processes include integrated flue-gas                   teatment in which sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfuric                       acid and nitric oxide is converted to ammonia or                                hydroxylamine; processing of biomass to convert alcohols to                     aldehydes and ketones; and \"galvanic cementation\" to recover                    metals such as copper and tin from waste streams.                                                                                                               Electrogenerative proceses are fundamentally attractive                         because they capture the energy released in the chemical                        process (which would traditionally be released as wasted heat)                  in a form that can be readily transported and reused.  In                       addition the three processes at the center of this study all                    use bothersome environmental pollutants as raw materials.                       These processes should be advantageous from perspectives of                     cost, energy conservation, and environmental protection.",
