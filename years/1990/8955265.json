Over three                       years, 75 participants from South Georgia will take part in                     an intensive 3-week course.  Hands-on laboratory experiments                    will include principles of enzyme action, principles of                         electrophoresis, DNA isolation from E.coli, separation of DNA                   and RNA using Sephadex, analysis of DNA fragments sizes, DNA                    fingerprinting, analysis of restriction enzyme patterns,                        characterization of supercoiled, nicked, and catenane forms.                    DNA sequence analysis and immunoelectrophoresis of proteins.                    Teacher participants will take a kit back with them to their                    schools to incorporate molecular biology techniques directly                    into their curricula.  Over the three-phase program, lead                       high school teachers will assist with the course and provide                    feedback on their use of these techniques in their home                         schools.                                                                                                                                                        A network of participants will develop into a biology                           interaction group which will continue to support the on-going                   program with the assistance of Valdosta State College.",
