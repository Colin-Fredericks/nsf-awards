 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation of 20 U.S.                    scientists in a binational workshop on \"Parameterization of                     Subgrid-Scale Processes in Dynamical Model of Medium Range                      Prediction and Global Climate\" to be held in Pune. India,                       August 6 to 10, 1990.  The Indian cooperating scientist is                      Dr. D.R. Sikka, Director, Indian Institute of Tropical                          Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India.  The workshop is planned to                    discuss the following areas:  convection (large scale and                       cumulus scale), radiation, orography, boundary layer fluxes,                    hydrological cycle, and biosphere processes.  The                               parameterization of these physical processes will be examined                   in global models for medium range forcasting (normally up to 10                 days), and for global climate.  Emphasis will be on the                         conditions in the tropics where the interaction between the                     dynamical fields and the parameterized convective, radiative                    and boundary layer processes is very rapid.  It is expected                     that better understanding of the controls of tropical climate                   will result, leading to further improvements in medium range                    forcasting, and in our general understanding of global climate                  change.  The workshop will also seek to identify areas for                      cooperative research.  Workshop proceedings are scheduled to be                 published.                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  U.S.-Indian cooperation in atmoshperic research                         stretches back to the 1970's and to the two year MONEX                          experiments in the winter of 1978 and summer of 1979.  Indian                   interest in predicting weather conditions, both long-term and                   medium term forcasts, is well known.  U.S. interest in the                      monsoon circulation, itself a planetary scale feature, is also                  very strong.  The IITM in Pune has long history of tropical                     research.  India also has recently established a National                       Center for Medium Range Weather Forcasting (NCMRF) in Delhi                     which has a newly acquired supercomputer.  Thus both the U.S.                   and India have the strong interest and resources to deal with                   research problems of the workshop topic.  Their collaboration                   is likely to benefit the two countries.",
