 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three classes of symbiont-bearing sarcodines                           (acantharia, polycystine radiolaria and foraminifera) are a                     conspicuous component of upper ocean communities.  Most of the                  previous research on the ecology of these taxa has been                         concentrated on a single species or limited group of species.                   Dr. Michaels and colleagues will simultaneously examine the                     ecological role of the entire assemblage of these three                         protozoa. Their research examines two hypotheses:  1.  In                       nutrient-poor oceanic environments, the symbiont primary                        production in the entire population of acantharia, polycystine                  radiolaria and foraminifera will represent a significant                        fraction of the total primary production and will dominate the                  production by large cells (operationally defined as cells                       larger than 74um).  2. Sarcodines will be a disproportionately                  important component of sinking material from the euphotic zone                  compared with their suspended biomass. Symbiont production                      rates of the entire population of symbiont-bearing sarcodines                   are determined through a combination of  large volume and                       diver-collected production measurements to evaluate the                         importance of this production relative to total primary                         production.  The significance of these planktonic protests for                  the vertical flux of material is estimated by the concurrent                    measurement of both the stocks of sarcodines and the rate of                    sinking export. These measurements are coordinated with the                     GOFS Time-Series Study at Bermuda (participation in two                         cruises per year), which enables the investigators to view                      their results from a large, seasonal perspective.",
