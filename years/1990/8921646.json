The articles will be incorporated into a single issue of                        the Marine Technology Society Journal designated volume                         24, number l to be published in March, 1990.  The Journal                       distribution is approximately 3,000 copies to members and                       subscribers throughout the marine technology community.                         An additional 100 copies will be provided to the National                       Science Foundation for distribution.                                                                                                                            Fifteen (15) papers were generated from the session.  They                      address techniques available  or required in the                                assessment of resources and conditions perquisite to                            evaluation, exploration and monitoring of the impact of                         activities in the ocean environment.  Original data are                         presented in the papers which advance the state of                              knowledge in ocean technology.",
