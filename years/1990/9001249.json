 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research addresses three basic questions:  (1)                What is the organizational structure of the broadcast media of                  Jamaica, and how is that structure penetrated by outside                        interest groups?  (2) What are the characteristics of the                       individuals who conceive and produce broadcast messages, both                   inside and outside formal mass media organizations?  (3) How                    much of the content of broadcasting is related to issues of                     national development, and what is the extent of foreign media                   penetration?  Several methods will be employed.  She will                       interview relevant communications and government employees,                     analyze demographic information on communications and government                workers, and analyze the program content of Jamaica's two radio                 networks and one television network longitudinally.",
