 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now widely recognized that in view of the excellent                       science and engineering capabilities that exist in many countries               in all parts of the world, it is increasingly important for                     U.S. scientists and engineers to remain in close touch with the                 activities and plans of their foreign colleagues, in part as a                  means for planning joint research programs with them.                           Additionally, gaining an understanding of many important                        scientific problems, such as those associated with the global                   environment, requires cooperative scientific efforts on a                       multinational basis.                                                                                                                                            U.S. scientists and engineers have a number of available                        mechanisms to maintain close communication with scientists and                  engineers in other countries.  Among the oldest and most                        extensive of these mechanisms are the non-governmental                          international disciplinary unions (the first was established in                 1919) which today comprise the International Council of                         Scientific Unions (ICSU) in which more than 70 countries are                    represented.  National members of these unions, as well as                      ICSU-proper, are private scientific bodies whose activities are                 normally determined by committees of working scientists.  In                    the United States, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) is                    the official adhering body to ICSU and its unions, and NAS                      disciplinary and non-disciplinary staff officers manage U.S.                    participation on behalf of the U.S. National Committees for                     ICSU and those unions.",
