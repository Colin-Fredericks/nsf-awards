 "awd_abstract_narration": "An organization, the Circumpolar Education Clearinghouse, will be               established to link educators and organizations concerned with the              education of native northern peoples into a network for the exchange of         information and other educationally useful activities.  Initial                 participants in the Clearinghouse will be from the United States,               Canada, Greenland, and the Scandinavian countries.  The Clearinghouse,          including its library, will be headquartered in the Alaska Native               Foundation in Anchorage. The Education and Resources Group in Boston            will also utilize its facilities and some staff members to support the          project.  Program components include establishment of the Curriculum            Library, a semiannual newsletter, a conference in Alaska in 1990, and           visits by Canadian, Greenlandic and Sami educators to Alaskan schools.          National Science Foundation (NSF) funding will primarily be used to             improve science and mathematics instruction in the elementary and               secondary schools of rural Alaska.                                                                                                                              Cost sharing by the partners will total 89% of the NSF funding.",
