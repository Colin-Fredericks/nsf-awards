 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mammalogy Section of the Los Angeles County Museum of                  Natural History has exhibited rapid growth over the past several                decades, and now comprises more than 85,000 catalogued specimens,               as well as an uncatalogued backlog of approximately 9,000                       additional specimens.  In size, this mammal collection is the                   ninth largest in North America and ranks among the 20 largest                   collections in the world.  The collection includes                              representatives of tropical species from around the world, as                   well as the holdings of the Marine Mammal Laboratory.  The                      Section has recently established a frozen tissue collection and                 laboratory facilities for molecular biology, a tool used in                     reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among taxonomic                   groups.  Dr. Sarah George, Associate Curator in the Section of                  Mammalogy, proposes completion of all preparation and computer                  cataloging of the backlogged specimens.                                              The proposed curatorial activities will bring important                    collections into the mainstream of research.  Until they are                    properly prepared, curated, and entered into the LACM computer                  database, it is difficult, if not impossible, for researchers to                gain access to and knowledge of these important specimens.                      Systematic collections in natural history museums are the most                  readable form of the evolution of life on earth.  Researchers in                ecology, systematics, biogeography and evolutionary biology are                 completely dependent on these research resources, and their                     continued growth and proper curation are critically important.",
