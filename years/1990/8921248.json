 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing research on law creation has been framed from within a                 variety of divergent theoretical positions.  Those taking the                   consensus perspective see law as a reflection of the collective                 views and interests of the community or general public.  Those                  taking a conflict perspective see law as a reflection of powerful               interests which result in the creation of laws to maintain                      various capitalist or ruling class interests.  Pluralist                        theorists see law as the outcome of conflict and compromise                     between a diversity of groups fighting for power.  These and                    other theoretical positions do not adequately account for the                   fact that law is also actively constituted through social                       relations and modes of discourse, including non-state normative                 orders.                                                                                                                                                         To date, there has been litte systematic research focussing on                  how legal and social norms influence each other.  This project                  will address this issue through studying the construction of the                Uniform Employment Termination Act.  The project is designed to                 examine the ways that the philosophy and assumptions of private                 justice, in the form of industrial discipline and discharge rules               and procedures, enter into the emergence and construction of law.               Qualitative research methods will include ethnographic                          fieldwork, interviews with and observations of the Uniform Law                  Commissioners drafting committee, and analyses of all related                   documents used in drafting the law.                                                                                                                             This study provides a unique opportunity to examine the process                 of lawmaking as it occurs, rather than retrospectively                          reconstructing that process.  The results should have important                 implications for the way other non-state social control forms,                  such as professional discipline, agency regulation, private                     tribunals, and commissions of inquiry might similarly penetrate                 the formation of other state law.  Thus, the research has                       important theoretical and practical implications.  In so far as                 it illuminates how private justice connects to state law, it will               help inform policy considerations when considering the impact of                legal and social change.",
