 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Science, Technology and Society (SSTS) supports research             about the intellectual and value contexts that govern the                       development and use of science and technology.  Ethics and Values               Studies, in SSTS, supports research on ethical and value aspects                of the interaction between science, technology and society.  This               research project seeks to understand how governmental decision                  making, differing values, and institutional mechanisms influence                the development and deployment of new satellite technologies.  In               particular, this project focuses on the effort to study and protect             planet earth, embodied in the emerging Global Change program. This              effort requires space monitoring, and NASA is currently sponsoring              a \"Mission to Earth\" program to develop and deploy satellites for               this purpose.  This project will examine the role of \"advocacy                  coalitions\" in moving technology from development to use.  Advocacy             coalitions can be comprised of developers, users, providers,                    funders, and other affected parties.  The research uses the case                of Mission to Earth and two others -- weather satellites and land               satellites (Landsat) to explore how values of these parties come                into conflict and whether and how the conflicts are resolved.                   Weather satellites are generally regarded as a successful linkage               of technological development with earth observation.  Institutional             relationships were established between developers and users at                  national and international scales.  Maintained and built over the               years, these relationships satisfy providers, funders and an                    enormous variety of other affected groups.  In contrast, the land               satellite program has been called a \"soap opera\" from the                       standpoint of government management of a new earth monitoring                   technology.  Since land observations are critical to Global Change              plans, the reasons behind Landsat's relative under-utilization are              as important to understand as those behind the comparatively strong             exploitation of the weather satellite.  A comparative examination               of governmental decision making will explore systematically the                 institutional dynamics of applying space technology to monitoring               planet earth.  It will identify institutional models that may                   assist in the consideration of policy alternatives for developing               and deploying this technology in the service of studying and                    protecting the earth's environment.  Results will be reported in                professional journals and at conferences, and presentations to                  federal policymakers concerned with issues of Global Change will                be arranged.                                                                                                                                                    This research has an important and timely focus; its results will               be useful and accessible to a wide audience.  The qualifications                and track record of the investigator are excellent; institutional               support is good; the research plan is sensible.  Support is highly              recommended.",
