 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                          Chemistry Program.  The synthesis of the complex new substances                 required by our society in a cost effective manner is the goal                  of this research.  This is a daunting challenge that requires                   considerable insight and ingenuity to accomplish.                                                                                                               Nature is replete with organic compounds of intricate molecular                 structure.  Often these materials may be isolated from their                    natural sources in quantity; more often they cannot.  The                       alternative to isolation is synthesis--laboratory manufacture                   from commonly available materials.  Although chemists have over                 the last half-century become rather adept at constructing small                 amounts of very complicated molecules, they generally cannot                    prepare most desired organic compounds in an efficient,                         practical, and cost-effective manner.  This general inability                   to conceive and execute practical laboratory syntheses                          constitutes a frailty of our science.  It is the long-term goal                 of this research to address this deficiency by inventing new                    strategies for the laboratory synthesis of complex organic                      structures.  The compounds to be synthesized are molecules of                   nature--alkaloids and polyisoprenoids. The intent is not just                   to make a compound, but to do it in a way that will lead to                     something new about the architectural aspect of                                 molecule-building.  The constant goals are:  (a) to minimize                    the required number of tranformations by eschewing protective                   groups whenever possible, (b) to minimize the required number                   of transformations by finding ways in which \"cascades\" of                       reactions can occur under the same reaction conditions, (c) to                  simplify the total synthesis process by using, to the extent                    possible, \"low-tech\", rather than exotic, expensive reagents.                   The specific systems to be studied are: petrosin, sarain-A,                     nominine, aristone, dictyoxetane, velutinal, crinipellin A and                  members of the daphniphyllum alkaloid family.",
