The projects are: (1) Research on the                        iterative redesign model applied to parametric design of                        components: Modifying and extending an existing system to include               the Taguchi philosophy of parametric design, and to include                     tolerance selection; (2) research on the iterative                              respecification model applied to parametric design of assemblies:               Developing a first domain-independent version of the model,                     including tolerance selection; (3) research on features and                     designing with features for components: Extension of the current                architecture and representation to deal with the more complexity,               including tolerances, curved surfaces, feature combinations,                    user-defined features, and (possibly) functional intent; (4)                    research on a feature-based computer environment for conceptual                 design of mechanical assemblies: Extension of the current                       multiple level of abstraction representation to include multiple                functional viewpoints; (5) research on extending the iterative                  redesign model to configuration and to conceptual design: Using                 features and concepts to assist evaluation and redesign of                      configuration and embodiments.",
