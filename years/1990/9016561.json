ATM provided assistance in starting this project.  The project                  demonstrates that when fifth-grade students are given the                       opportunity to participate in highly-motivational activities in                 weather study, they will acquire skills in basic scientific                     procedures, positive attitudes towards the study of science, and                a greater awareness of career opportunities in sciences,                        especially in meteorology.  Increased costs associated with the                 project that could not be accommodated in this year's Bronx                     school system budget threaten the continued existence of the                    project.  NSF support will enable the purchase of a new facsimile               machine require as a result of recent changes in the National                   Weather Services (NWS) policy.  Also, funding will support                      anticipated increased costs associated with receiving satellite-                imagery and weather-graphics transmissions.",
