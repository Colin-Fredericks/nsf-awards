 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports a dissertation research                     by Mrs. W. M. Tahseen of the Pakistan Council of Scientific                     and Industrial Research (PCSIR), Karachi, who is currently                      completing her doctoral work at the University of Illinois,                     Urbana, in collaboration with Dr. Larry Hansen, and Dr. David                   Schaeffer of that Univeristy.  The research includes sampling                   of sites near chemical plants for pollutants in water, soil,                    plant and/or animal after establishing acute bioassay                           capability for the in-country field work, subjecting the                        obtained samples to organochlorine and elemental analysis and                   additional bioassays, carrying out of statistical analyses of                   the data, and developing site contamination maps displaying                     multiple toxic endpoint contours.                                                                                                                               Scope:  The project involves two experienced U.S.                               toxocologist with a young Pakistani researcher with the                         backing of the main industrial research organization in                         Pakistan.  The problem to be dealt with is critical in                          Pakistan and other growing Third World Countries and is also                    important to the U.S.  This project meets the Science in                        Developing Countries' criteria for the dissertaion                              improvement by allowing the Pakistani graduate student to do                    field work in that country.",
