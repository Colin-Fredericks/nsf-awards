 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program is being funded by the Organic Synthesis                  Program.  Dr. Fraser-Reid will explore the synthetic potential                  of a new method for controlling the chemistry of the anomeric                   center in carbohydrates.  It will provide an important new tool                 for carbohydrate research.  This will lead to new routes to the                 complex carbohydrates that nature uses at cell surfaces as                      recognition elements.                                                                                                                                           During the earlier work, a serendipitous observation was made,                  while synthesizing the ansa chain of Streptovaricin A, which                    led to a study of the chemistry of n-pentenyl glycosides                        (NPGs).  It was shown that halonium ion-induced reaction of                     NPGs provides for specific activation of the anomeric center                    enabling the hydrolysis of glycosides under neutral conditions.                 Coupling to sugar alcohols afforded higher saccharides, and the                 fact that a C-2 ester \"disarms\", while a C-2 ether \"arms\" the                   NPG, provided a ready protocol for controlled synthesis of                      oligosaccharides.  However, it was also found that, depending                   on the inorganic source of halonium ion, the disarmed ester can                 be made to react readily.  Thus, NPGs offer the potential for                   promoter-specific and/or substrate-specific reactions, thereby                  allowing great flexibility in the assembly of complex                           oligosaccharides.  Studies aimed at developing this methodology                 will be undertaken.                                                                                                                                             Pursuant to the above, it was also found that protection of a                   cis-diol as a cyclic acetal causes an NPG to react more slowly                  than protection as benzyl ethers.  This will also be examined                   as an alternative armed/disarmed strategy.  A study to                          rationalize these various reactivities will be undertaken and                   will take advantage of results of MM2 and ab initio                             calculations.                                                                                                                                                   The reactions of NPGs have been found to eject a                                (R)-1-halomethylfuran with about 80% enantiomeric excess.  Ways                 to optimize this value and to prepare complex furanoids, such                   as insect pheromones, will be investigated.",
