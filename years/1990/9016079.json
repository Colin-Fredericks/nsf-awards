Many kinetic and                                            mechanistic models for MOCVD have                                               been proposed that include                                                      numerous reactions steps and kinetic                                            parameters.  However, few studies                                               have been conducted to study the                                                reactions occurring at the surface                                              during the growth of III-V                                                      semiconductors.  In situ techniques                                             are available to characterize                                                   surface reactions but they are                                                  normally limited to study lower                                                 temperatures and pressures than                                                 those employed in MOCVD growth (to                                              1Atm.and>500oC).  Most notably,                                                 transmission and reflectance                                                    infrared spectroscopy in conjunction                                            with isotopic labelling has                                                     revolutionized our understanding                                                of catalytic reaction on solid                                                  surfaces.  As temperature increases,                                            semiconductors are no longer                                                    transparent in the infrared and                                                 transmission techniques can not be                                              employed; indeed, these solids begin                                            to emit radiation. Fortunately, the                                             spectra of the emitted radiation can                                            be analyzed by similar techniques                                               and contains similar information                                                with regard to the adsorbed                                                     intermediates.  Thus, emission                                                  spectroscopy may be an effective                                                tool for determining these reactive                                             species for higher temperature                                                  reactions on semiconducting                                                     surfaces.  We propose to use                                                    infrared emission spectroscopy in                                               conjunction with isotopic tracers                                               and on-line mass spectroscopy to                                                investigate the surface species                                                 during the adsorption and reaction                                              and to show how different precursors                                            effect surface compositions.  In                                                parallel transmission infrared and                                              detailed surface analyses for the                                               same samples will be conducted at                                               Fort Monmouth.  This unique                                                                                                                                     combination of complementary                                                    techniques will then be used to                                                 better determine surface                                                        reaction models for growth of II-V                                              semiconductor surfaces.",
