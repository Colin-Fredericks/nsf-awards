 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Dr. Carlton Caves of the University of Southern California                      and Dr. Gerald J. Milburn of the Department of Physics,                         University of Queensland, Australia.  An overall                                objective of this research is to advance characterization                       of photons. Characterization of photons are a partial                           function of the properties -- which determine the                               optical frequency mode -- of particular detectors.                              Development of a theory of continual optical-frequency                          measurements is therefore necessary to advance                                  characterization of photons. Without such  theory, it                           becomes  difficult to find quantum limitations to high-                         precision optical detection of photons.  The specific                           objective of this project is to develop a theoretical                           framework for describing and analyzing continual                                quantum-limited detection of optical fields.                                                                                                                    The project continues collaboration of U.S. and Australian                      researchers who have made significant contributions to                          development of this theoretical framework. Expectations                         are that the project will improve the framework;                                contribute to the foundations of quantum physics; and,                          in addition, lead to advances in applications in modern                         optics and optical communications theory.",
