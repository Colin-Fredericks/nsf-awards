 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces lower division engineering students to                  state-of-the-art scientific computing environment.  Key components              of this environment include two high-performance workstations, a                widely-used scientific subprogram library, and a very high-level                problem solving environment.  A color PostScript printer provides               state-of-the-art printing capability.  Equipment support for the                introductory course in scientific computing previously consisted                of an IBM mainframe and attached terminals;  this new                           instrumentation expands an existing NSF-funded laboratory, thus                 allowing the course to demonstrate modern methods in problem                    solving and scientific software development.  Students gain a                   knowledge of the capabilities of existing software libraries and                systems and then learn to critically evaluate problems in order to              recognize which ones require custom-designed software, which may                be approached using library routines, and which may be rapidly                  solved with a very high-level programming language.  Problems                   requiring varying amounts of computational resources will be solved             so that students will acquire expertise in the selection of the                 appropriate hardware environment.  The award is being matched by                an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.",
