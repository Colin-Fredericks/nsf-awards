 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasmas have become important in materials processing because                   they can provide a highly chemically reactive environment                       while remaining at relatively low overall gas temperatures.                     One of the more common industrial reactors consists of radio                    frequency (RF) power capacitively coupled to two parallel                       plate electrodes.  The material to be processed is placed on                    one of the electrodes and the plasma generated in the fill gas                  provides the free radicals, ions and energetic neutrals needed                  for the particular chemical process.                                                                                                                            With this Career Advancement Award, the PI will design and                      construct a \"standard\" RF reference parallel plate reactor                      with maximum capability for diagnostics as well as certain                      characteristics desirable for modeling.  Specifically, the                      reactor will have the following properties                                      - RF power (capacitively coupled)            0 - 500 Watts                      - RF Frequency                               13.56 MHz                          - Electrode Spacing                          2.54 cm                            - argon                                      99.999%                            - Gas flow                                   2 - 20 sccm                        - Gas pressure                               0.1 -1.0 Torr                      The diagnostics she plans to measure include: (1) the first                     five harmonics, magnitude and phase of the voltage and current                  at both electrodes, (2) spatial and temporal measurements of                    the visible optical emission, (3) spatial measurements of                       eletron temperature and density, and (4) spatial measurements                   of the electron energy distribution function.  The results of                   these measurements will be compared to measurements taken on                    another reactor on the University of Michigan campus.  Once                     the standard reactor is fully characterized, it will be used                    as for comparison in the modeling and experimental study and                    analysis of industrial reactors.  The grant will advance the                    career of the PI by providing her initial experience in a new                   line of research on which future projects can be based.",
