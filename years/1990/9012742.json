 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first goal of this project is to empirically assess, by using               a simulated insanity defense trial with mock-jurors how mock-juror              insanity defense verdicts are affected by:  a) shifting the burden              of proof to the defendants; b) the availability of the \"guilty but              mentally ill\" verdict choice; and, c) narrowing insanity tests or               standards.  The second goal is to empirically determine (again                  with mock-jurors) how race of defendant and race of victim                      influences juror decision-making within the insanity trial domain.              In addition, the PI proposes to examine how jurors's attitudes                  toward:  a) \"due process of law\" versus \"crime control\"; b) the                 death penalty; c) the insanity defense itself; and d) the                       efficacy/believability of expert psychological testimony relate to              their insanity defense verdicts.  One of the most fundamental                   questions being asked in regard to the insanity defense is:  What               are the causally efficacious factors which affect juror                         determination of a \"Not Guilty by Reason of Insanity (NGRI)\"                    verdict?",
