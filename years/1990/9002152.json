 "awd_abstract_narration": "One central theme of this project focuses on nonlinear                     partial differential equations representing the evolution of                    certain physical phenomena.  An evolution equation whose                        solutions are smoother than the initial data is said to have a                  gain of regularity.  An example of this occurs in the Schrodinger               equation if the initial data decay faster than any polynomial.                  Some success has also been obtained in the nonlinear area,                      particularly in the case of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.  In                 this work, a general class of equations will be investigated for                gain in regularity.  It will concentrate on equations in three                  space dimensions and seek to prove that gain in regularity is                   governed by the sign of the third derivative of the solution.                   Method of proof uses the technique of nonlinear multipliers and a               fundamental energy (integral) estimate which shows the gain.                    Efforts will also be made in applying similar ideas to dispersive               equations such as nonlinear Schrodinger equations.                                   A second line of investigation concerns spectral and inverse               spectral problems of the Laplace operator or the Laplace operator               plus a potential defined on compact Riemannian manifolds.  Three                objectives of this work are to: (1) describe the distribution of                the eigenvalues, (2) identify the properties of a Riemannian                    metric or a potential which are spectral invariants, and (3)                    determine the metrics or potentials which can be isospectrally                  deformed in a mathematically significant manner.  Particular                    emphasis will be placed on measuring the pattern of gaps between                eigenvalues and the density properties of potentials with a                     finite number of double eigenvalues.",
