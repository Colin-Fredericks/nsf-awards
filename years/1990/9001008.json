 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will conduct research on                        problems which intersect various branches of probability theory                 including the classical theory of partial sums of independent                   random variables, probability in Banach spaces and the theory of                random sets.  The major objective is to clarify and extend the                  understanding of three related probabilistic topics which are of                both theoretical and applied interest:  1)  approximate the                     distribution of sums of independent real valued random vectors                  and their accompanying self-normalized sums;  2)  asymptotic                    theory of partial maxima of independent and identically                         distributed sample continuous processes;  3)  unions of                         independent or dependent random sets and models for growth.  The                first two topics have potential applications to statistics,                     while the third topic has potential applications to biology.                    The work will be conducted with collaborators.",
