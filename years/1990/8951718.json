 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique approach is taken for enhancing theoretical course work                in statistical process control (SPC).  By introducing laboratory                work into the course using simulated scenarios of actual                        processes, students will learn the implication, demands, and                    constraints of SPC tools .  A new Quality in Manufacturing                      Laboratory (QIML) is created to improve the learning process in our             quality control course.  The primary goal of this project is to                 provide a realistic manufacturing environment for students to                   investigate the effectiveness of SPC techniques.  This is achieved              through discrete event simulation with a graphics display.                                                                                                      The QIML consists of a set of ten student computer workstations,                instructor workstation, and system station on an Ethernet local                 area network.  Students can perform a variety of functions at                   their workstation through the course of the experiment.  A large                screen projector displays an overall picture of the system so that              students maintain a wide-scope perspective on the problem.                                                                                                      Experiments include process capability, SPC monitoring,                         experimental design, acceptance  sampling, and total interaction.               The equipment provides for interaction between the instructor and               students as well as among students.",
