 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonprocedural programming, such as functional, has been an attractive           approach to programming parallel computers.  Programs written in such           languages exhibit implicit parallelism which can be exploited for               their efficient parallel execution.  This project will investigate the          applicability of equational style to parallel programming. Equational           programming is a style of nonprocedural programming in which a system           of oriented equations of the form l -> r, where l and r are terms,              constitute a program.  Equational languages have logical semantics              which is intuitive and easy to understand.  A new class of equations            called path sequential systems has been identified.  This class of              equations is naturally suitable for parallel execution of equational            programs on both shared memory as well as message passing                       architectures.  Efficient strictness analysis techniques have been              developed which work well for flat parallelism in equational programs.          In continuation of this research, a parallelizing compiler and run-             time system for a first order equational language that is constructor           based will be implemented.  The implementation will be done on a                shared memory and on a message passing parallel computer.  A major              thrust of this investigation will be on load balancing and minimizing           inter-processor communications.  Specifically, dynamic load balancing           strategies that are based on regular communication patterns of path             sequential systems will be investigated.  Finally, the performance of           the equational programming system will be examined by executing                 numerical and nonnumerical applications such as sparse matrix                   computations and toy theorem provers.",
