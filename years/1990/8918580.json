 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to advance                            understanding of the microbial ecology of anaerobic cellulose                   degradation in soils and sediments.  At present, little is known                of the complex microbial processes responsible for the conversion               in the absence of oxygen, of cellulose, the most abundantly-                    produced organic material in terrestrial environments, to CO2 and               CH4.  An important objective of the project is to develop methods               to identify, enumerate, and estimate the activity of groups of                  anaerobic cellulolytic bacteria in soils and sediments.  Rapid                  RNA sequencing methodology will be used to sequence 16S ribosomal               RNAs of isolated strains of cellulose-fermenting bacteria.                      Sequences will be aligned to identify those that are shared by                  members of groups of bacteria.  Oligodeoxynucleotides                           complementary to these unique sequences will be used as probes to               detect the presence and activity of specific groups of                          cellulolytic bacteria in controlled experiments and in                          environmental samples.  A second objective of the project is to                 use these probes to investigate the activity of cellulolytic                    bacteria in poorly-drained forest soil at a proposed study site                 in Central Massachusetts.  A final objective concerns the ability               of cellulose-fermenting bacteria to fix N2.  Several strains of                 bacteria from soils and sediments have recently been shown to use               cellulose as an energy source for the fixation of N2.  Strains of               cellulose-fermenting bacteria isolated as part of the proposed                  project, as well as additional presently known strains, will be                 examined for the presence of nitrogenase activity in order to                   determine the prevalence of the ability to fix N2 among                         cellulose-fermenting bacteria, thus setting the groundwork for                  establishing an important link between carbon and nitrogen cycles               in natural environments.  Such processes are likely to be common                in many natural systems, where they may be indications of                       important biological processes.",
