 "awd_abstract_narration": "Income flows across regions are at the core of important                   theories in Geography and Regional Science relating to regional capital         accumulation and corporate dominance.  Major problems with research             relating to interregional income flows are the lack of a consistent             theory about the nature of flows and the lack of an adequate data base          to test hypotheses.  The purpose of this project is to investigate              income flows across boundaries Transboundary flows of personal income           and consumption expenditures include the proceeds from the absentee             ownership of capital, commuter salaries, and tourist spending.  The             investigators will develop a data base on flows of capital-related              income across state boundaries by refining and reconciling previously           unavailable data from the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau of               Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of the Census.  The data will be used         to discern patterns of capital-related income flows across regions.             These patterns will be based on the regression of these \"transboundary\"         flows on several important variables thought to explain capital flows.          The data will also be used to test a key hypothesis regarding the               extent to which economic characteristics of business operations and             regional economic structure affect capital accumulation.                                                                                                             The study will build a data base on interregional capital flows.           It will contribute to regional capital theory, which has long been              constrained by lack of capital flow data, and to other research that            involves the development of nonsurvey methods for the construction of           social accounting matrices at the sub-state level.  The study will              assess the explanatory value of regional differences in firm size,              character of financial institutions, and credit policies in the                 explanation of these flows.  By increasing our understanding of the             ways that economic activities expand and contract, local and regional           officials will be better able to anticipate and plan for these marked           multiplier effects.",
