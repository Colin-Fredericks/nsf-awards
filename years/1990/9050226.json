 "awd_abstract_narration": "Based upon the Teaching Integrated Mathematics and Science (TIMS)               teacher enhancement materials,l complete K-6 and science materials will         be developed. Students will spend about half their time doing hands-on          quantitative experiments and activities, a fourth of their time involved        in open ended problem solving, and a fourth of their time learning              methods of arithmetic.                                                                                                                                          The classroom materials produced by the project will include a total of         140 hands-on experiments which combine knowledge of significant science         and mathematics (each of which takes about five class periods to                complete), problem solving modules, a textbook, and an adventure book.          Students will pursue problems in small groups, discover relationships           through experiments, and discuss their results.  They will gather,              graph, and analyze data.  They will, through sequences of questions             about the experiments, make conjectures, find alternative methods,              discuss connections, verify conclusions, and reinforce skills.                                                                                                  Support for the curriculum will include extensive teacher materials in          addition to a teacher preparation textbook, an inservice/staff                  development program,l an assessment package, and a program for parent           involvement.  The curriculum will make extensive use of appropriate             technologies including calculators and computers.  Teachers' pedagogical        skill and knowledge should increase through use of these materials.             Evaluation of the project encompasses both formative evaluation during          the pilot test phase and summative evaluation during the field test             phase.  As part of the summative evaluation, the children's growth in           conceptual development, the children's attitudes, and the teachers'             attitudes and knowledge will all be studied and compared with other             curricula.",
