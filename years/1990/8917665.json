 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glia maturation factor (GMF) is a brain protein first detected in               Dr. Lim's laboratory in 1972.  The factor stimulates the                        proliferation and subsequent differentiation of astrocytes and                  Schwann cells.  Endogenous GMF is also found in these cells,                    suggesting an autoregulatory function.  Dr. Lim has recently                    achieved the milestone of purifying, sequencing, and cloning of                 the GMF protein along with the production of the recombinant                    growth factor which matches the natural protein in all respects.                The chemically defined factor is now designated GMF-beta, in                    distinction from the cruder samples previously used.  The pure                  protein promotes the maturation of neurons as well as glia, and                 arrests the growth of tumor cells of neuronal and glial origin.                                                                                                 This research is a continuation of Dr. Lim's on-going                           effort to employ immunology as a tool to elucidate the mechanism                of action of GMF-beta in the nervous system.  Dr. Lim plans to do               the following experiments: (1) to develop an anti-idiotypic                     antibody against GMF-receptors; (2) to demonstrate cell surface                 GMF-beta with antibodies in order to prove the hypothesis that                  GMF exerts its action through intercellular contact.",
