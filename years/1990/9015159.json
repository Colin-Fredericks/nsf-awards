Their neurocontrol                       algorithms will be used to deploy the active surfaces of a                      wing.  This will be simulated with neural networks                              monitoring various sensors and controlling the active                           wing surfaces.  The P.I.'s believe that it is possible to take                  control theory that has been used in robotics and develop                       it to function in aeronautical applications.  To prove this,                    they will employ a system they are using in a robotic                           application that is based on a distributed adaptive control                     theory developed by Seraji (1989) and enhanced with                             neural networks.  They will use a multiple neural network                       systems approach as outlined in their NSF Final Report                          (                                                                               will be tested in a flight simulation and demonstrated in                       a realistic scenario on a high resolution, three                                dimensional graphics workstation.",
