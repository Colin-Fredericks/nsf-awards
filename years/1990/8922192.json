 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to determine the relationship between                 market structure (concentration, costs, entry barriers and product              differentiation) and economic performance (profits, prices,                     efficiency, growth and welfare) in U.S. food industries.  The                   research will address the shortcomings of existing market behavior              studies by initiating time-series analysies of specific food                    industries.  The planning stages will be limited to the potato                  industry but it will expand to two additional food industries in                the expanded proposal.  This planning grant is intended to generate             resources for collecting data, developing appropriate research                  methods and identifying food industries with meaningful databases.              These activities will be facilitated by collaboration with a                    recently formed Northeast-165 regional committee, Private                       Strategies, Public Policies and Food System performance.  It is                 expected that significant changes in the amount of concentration                (structure) and contracting (organization) in the potato industry               should provide meaningful data for testing theories which predict               different relationships between structure and performance.                      Further, available data on firms performance by size should allow               for testing the role of strategic groups within industries.",
