 "awd_abstract_narration": "The College of Engineering at Michigan State University project will            develop funding, recruiting and retention programs for women and                minorities seeking Ph.D. degrees.  The College will continue to recruit         these students to its nationally recognized research centers.  NSF funds        initially  will be used for support of six students while the College           develops recurring fellowship funding to provide long-term stability for        the program.  The efforts will emphasize recruitment of African                 Americans and women.  The goal is to provide a four to five year funding        profile for outstanding Ph.D. students having the monetary advantages           of a fellowship while involving the student in regular research and             teaching.  The full fellowship during the first year permits the student        flexibility while choosing a research advisor.  During years 2 through          4, the student's primary support will be provided by research and               teaching assistantships.  This helps assure that the student contributes        to research and teaching, thereby acting as a role model for other              students.  Dissertation fellowships are available for the final year to         allow the student to complete papers and the dissertation.  During the          NSF award period, the NSF fellowship model would be used while Michigan         State University develops continuing endowments to operate the proposed         program.",
