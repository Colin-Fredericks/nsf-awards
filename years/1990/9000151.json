 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will test several hypotheses regarding the control                 of oceanic primary productivity (primarily phytoplankton                        productivity) by varying the amounts of dissolved trace metals                  needed for growth (Fe, Mn and Zn) and also those which may be                   toxic and are often also present (Cu and Co).  In nature the                    extent to which these metals are complexed by naturally                         occurring organic compounds may control their availability to                   the phytoplankton.  This research will investigate several                      areas of the ocean which are underutilizing the dissolved                       nutrients nitrate and phosphate, perhaps because of lack of                     needed trace metals or excess of toxic trace metals.  The                       experiments to be done will involve: 1) determining the                         concentrations of dissolved trace metals versus depth at                        several stations, and 2) at each station varying the amounts                    and availabilities of the trace metals Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu and Co in                 living phytoplankton cultures.  The results of the second set                   of experiments will be compared with phytoplankton growth                       experiments wherein no additional metals have been added in                     order to quantify the magnitude of varying availabilities of                    the trace metals.",
