 "awd_abstract_narration": "As governments and other institutions become aware of new                  information about changing conditions in their environments, they               alter their goals, expectations, and behavior.  This process by which           institutions change their skills, beliefs, and/or interpretations in            response to new information and experiences is called social learning.          Most research on learning has focused on individuals and small groups.          This project will continue research at a different scale, focusing on           the ways that national governments alter their attitudes and actions            with respect to environmental risks as new information becomes                  available.  Work begun in 1989 will be continued, with initial emphasis         on the prototyping of research methods in a case study in the Federal           Republic of Germany.  Those efforts will lay the foundation for a               subsequent comparative analysis that also will include the United               States, the Netherlands, Sweden, the U.S.S.R., the United Kingdom, and          the European Community.  Within each jurisdiction, news reports,                official records, and other sources of information will be used to              outline the historical sequence of major environmental events and               responses.  Among the major functions for which processes in different          states will be compared are (1) risk identification and                         characterization, (2) risk context, (3) risk estimation, (4)                    identification of control options, (5) assessment of costs of                   implementation, (6) goal selection, (7) strategy selection, (8)                 strategy implementation, and (9) strategy evaluation.                                This project will continue research on an important line of                inquiry into the processes by which human institutions perceive and             respond to changing environmental conditions.  It will enhance our              general understandings of how large, complex institutions function, and         it will provide a comparative framework for assessing the ways in which         different nations evaluate and deal with global environmental change.",
