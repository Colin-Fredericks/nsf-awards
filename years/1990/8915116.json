 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the award is to provide partial financial                 support for the International Conference on Modulation                          Spectroscopy to be held March 17-21, 1990, in San Diego,                        California.  The funds from the National Science Foundation will                be used for travel expenses for both domestic and foreign                       scientists and engineers to attend and participate in the                       conference.  Topics to be emphasized at the conference include:                 physics and properties of artificially produced materials such as               single and multiple quantum wells, delta-doped layers of                        materials, heterojunctions and superlattices, physics of two-                   dimensional electron gas, effects of pressure, temperature,                     electric and magnetic fields, in-situ studies of materials                      processing, application to electronic devices, etc.  The goal of                the conference is to assemble the top scientists and engineers in               the world having knowledge of modulation spectroscopy for the                   purposes of exchange of results from research, and definition of                future opportunities and barriers to progress in research in the                field.",
