 "awd_abstract_narration": "The embryonic development of the Drosophila salivary glands                     provides several advantages for analysis of the genes involved in               determination and differentiation. In the ectoderm of the germ                  band extended embryo, the glands begin development  at a defined                position which suggests the involvement of several known pattern                regulating genes. Differentiation then occurs within a few                      hours, implying that there are few steps leading from commitment                to differentiation. This proposal suggests methods to identify                  genes acting in the salivary glands at this early stage and to                  order them into a pathway for salivary gland development.                       Salivary gland marker genes will be identified using P-lacZ                     transposons that express beta-galactosidase in tissue specific                  patterns that include the salivary glands. Embryos homozygous for               lethal transposon inserts will be examined for phenotypes that                  alter salivary gland development. For non-lethal inserts,                       mutations will be induced by imprecise transposon excision to                   test whether an adjacent gene is required for the development of                salivary glands. For some inserts that are shown to be within or                near to a gene that is important for salivary gland development,                regions flanking the insert will be cloned by plasmid rescue and                these regions searched for embryonic salivary gland transcripts.                To get clues to gene function, exonic regions will be sequenced                 and examined for homology with known genes. Finally, mutations in               required genes will be examined for effects on beta-galactosidase               expression in several enhancer trap lines. Results form these                   tests will help define a pathway for embryonic salivary gland                   development.                                                                    %%%                                                                             Investigations of the genes that form patterns in early                         drosophila development have been spectacularly successful in                    solving the longstanding riddle of how a single fertilized egg                  cell develops the intricate and regular pattern that                            characterizes the mature embryo. This proposal is an attempt to                 extend those studies downstream to the actual formation of a                    differentiated organ, the salivary gland.",
