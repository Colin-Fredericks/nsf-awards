 "awd_abstract_narration": "The quality of the science of astronomy depends, like all the                   natural sciences, on the acquisition of fundamental data about the              objects of its concern.  Three of such fundamental data in                      astronomy are the masses, radii, and luminosities of stars.  These              data vary greatly with stellar types.  So do the problems                       associated with their acquisition.                                                                                                                              The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to continue with his                   current NSF-funded research program of obtaining mass, radius, and              luminosity data of stars by measuring the velocity variations of                eclipsing binary stars.  In the past, the PI focused on early type              main sequence stars, which are relatively bright and, hence, easy               to observe.  In the present proposal, he intends to focus on binary             systems with G- and K-type main-sequence stars, for which                       relatively few reliable results have been obtained to date because              of these stars' faintness.  To overcome the problems associated                 with faintness, the PI will be using the recently developed                     Hamilton Echelle Spectrometer and a charge-coupled device (CCD) of              the Lick Observatory.                                                                                                                                           In addition to the project just described, the PI will be alert to              \"targets of opportunity\" and search for faint secondary components              of bright evolved B stars.",
