 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is commonly accepted that shallow crystallization and                        degassing of silicic magmas contribute to the potential                         explosivity of a volcanic eruption, but the rates at which such                 processes operate in natural systems are unknown.  The recent                   eruption of Mount St. Helens involved both explosive and non-                   explosive (dome-building) episodes that have followed a pattern                 of decreasing intensity and decreasing time-averaged magma                      production rates from 1980 through 1986;  this trend has been                   interpreted to be the result of progressive of a single batch of                dacite magma (e.g. Scandone and Malone, 1985).  This project is                 for a detailed textural and chemical study of the products of the               1980 explosive eruptions of Mount St. Helens volcano with the                   goal of 1) using changes in glass chemistry and groundmass                      crystallinity together with stratigraphic work on deposits of May               18, 1980 (provided  by Criswell, 1987) to assemble a pre-eruption               stratigraphy of the Mount St. Helens magmatic system. 2)                        quantifying observed groundmass changes through the summer of                   1980 to determine rates of crystallization in response to system                degassing and depressurization, and 3) relating measured                        crystallinity and bulk chemistry to physical changes in eruptive                style of the volcano; in particular, relating these parameters to               observed patterns of degassing and changes in eruption rate and                 intensity.  Proposed methods of study including not only                        detailed microprobe, BASEM and TEM analysis, but also                           quantification of textural parameters (e.g. the size and shape                  distributions of crystals and vesicles) made possible by recent                 advances in automated image analysis capabilities.  This study                  differs from other approached to the \"petrologic\" inverse                       problem\" not only in the extreme sample control based on timing,                seismicity, and eruption style, but also in the application of                  textural as well as chemical criteria for sample classification.",
