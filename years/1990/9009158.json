 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thermomechanical behavior of fiber reinforced composite                parts will be investigated.  The objective of the study is to                   conduct research in modeling, analysis and process simulation of                the thermomechanical behavior of compression molded fiber                       reinforced polymer parts.  Such a study will increase our                       understanding of the phenomena and the physics behind shrinkage,                warpage and surface waviness of reinforced plastic parts.  The                  project can be divided into two portions:  an experimental and a                computer modeling potion,.  The experimental aspect of the research             deals with thermomechanical material properties qualification and               characterization.  Here, the effect that different types of                     matrices and fillers have on part's properties will be studied.                 During these studies different degrees of fiber orientation will                be considered.  In the second portion of the project a finite                   element computer simulation of the thermomechanical processes that              take place during molding will be developed.  The simulation will               be compared to parts of complex geometry molded under realistic                 industrial processing conditions.  Understanding the                            thermomechanical behavior of plastics and being able to predict                 filling patterns, fiber orientation, shrinkage, warpage and surface             waviness before a part is actually molded leads to higher part                  quality and eliminates some of the expensive and time consuming                 tasks done in the early stages of part and mold design.",
