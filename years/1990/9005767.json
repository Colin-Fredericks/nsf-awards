 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ribosome is a small particle composed of molecules of                       proteins and ribonucleic acid which is responsible for the                      synthesis of proteins in the cell.  A wide variety of                           experimental methods are providing information on the                           structure of this particle.  Dr. Harvey is developing                           computer modeling methods for integrating that information                      into models for the ribosome and for other ribonucleoprotein                    complexes.  The procedures are capable of producing low or                      high resolution models, depending on the available data.  The                   lowest resolution \"succinct\" models identify only the                           locations of the principal substructures, such as individual                    proteins and RNA stems, but no more detailed information; at                    the other extreme are all-atom models.  Models of mixed                         resolution are also produced, with succinct models for most                     of the structure and all-atom detail only where sufficient                      information exists.  These procedures produce a range of                        models, all consistent with the experimental data and provide                   quantitative statements about the uncertainties in various                      parts of the structure, which should be useful in guiding                       future experimental studies.  The study will involve                            extensions and improvements to the methodology, including                       more powerful algorithms for energy minimization, Monte                         Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations on all-atom models.                   It also describes applications to the E. coli ribosome,                         eukaryotic small nuclear ribonucleoproteins, RNase P, and the                   Tetrahymena ribozyme.",
