 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support exploratory research on a                           technique to decontaminate soil by use of electroosmosis.                       In this process, an ionic liquid under action of an                             applied electric field moves through the porous and                             permeable contaminated soil in a manner thought to be less                      conducive to channeling than pressure-drive flows.  The                         drive-liquid containing the contaminant is then replaced                        in the soil by a clean purge solution.  The contaminated                        fluid is collected for appropriate treatment.                                                                                                                   This proposal was submitted to NSF under conditions                             outlined in NSF 89-85, Small Grants for Exploratory                             Research (SGER).  The proposed research which addresses a                       topic of significant National interest, has previously                          been successfully applied in dewatering and consolidation                       of soils and may prove to be useful for removal of organic                      contaminants of soil.  It has significance and potentially                      direct application to removal of contaminants from soil                         alone and in conjunction with other physical, chemical and                      biological processes.",
