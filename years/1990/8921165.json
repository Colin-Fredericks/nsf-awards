 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program on X-ray is a continuation of                             the development of mask response studies, process                               modeling and photoresist characterization.  The                                 program will provide new insights and techniques in                             the areas of semiconductor manufacturing using X-                               ray Lithography-based techniques.                                                                                                                               Thrust: Development and study of X-ray Lithography                              process components suitable for 0.25 micrometer and                             below.  These studies capitalize on the uniqueness of                           the X-ray source, the electron storage ring Aladdin,                            and of the facilities of the Center for X-ray                                   Lithography.                                                                                                                                                    Methods: concentrate on key areas offering the                                  highest productivity and likelihood of making a                                 significant impact.  These areas will involve the use                           of the inspection and characterization facilities                               available at the Center for X-ray Lithography to                                maximize the effectiveness of the studies.  We plan to                          continue the study of mask response, extending it to                            silicon carbide and polysilicon membranes and to                                continue developing new fundamental photoelectron                               models in the area of photoresist modeling.  New                                topics will be started in the area of projection X-ray                          Lithography, based on the use of the existing X-ray                             microscope, and of alignment with the                                           implementation of the linear Fresnel zone plate                                 system.                                                                                                                                                         Goals: to further characterize and understand mask                              response; to perform preliminary experiments in                                 projection X-ray Lithography; to extend the physical                            models of photoresist response; to implement and                                test a novel alignment scheme based on linear                                   Fresnel zone plate.",
