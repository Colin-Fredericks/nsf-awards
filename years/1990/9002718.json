The focus of this project is to assess the performance of                       previously retrofitted buildings, a unique opportunity for                      this kind of study made possible by this particular event.                      The work to be conducted includes:                                                                                                                                 (1)  documentation of observed damages of several (3-10)                                    buildings,                                                                                                                                          (2)  detailed analysis of seismic behavior                                                                                                                      (3)  field testing of damaged buildings for their dynamic                            properties,                                                                                                                                                (4)  destructive tests as necessary and as permitted by the                          owner, and                                                                                                                                                 (5)  identification of improved retrofitting techniques.                                                                                                     In addition, tests of wood frame connections will be carried                    out to assess the seismic performance of plywood shear walls.",
