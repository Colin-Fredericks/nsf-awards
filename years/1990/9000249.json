 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eighth Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference will be                held April 12-14, 1990 in Denton, Texas.  The meeting is                        sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology, which states                in its guidelines:  \"Regional meetings are an important activity                of the Society for Developmental Biology....The function of the                 Regional Conference is to provide a more informal opportunity                   than national meetings for the exchange of information on                       development.  Participation by graduate students, postdoctorals                 and junior faculty is particularly encouraged....\"  The meeting                 will adhere to this goal.  This will be achieved by inviting                    three prominent speakers to present different aspects of                        developmental neurobiology.  In addition, developmental                         biologists from the Southwestern region will be encouraged to                   present recent and preliminary findings from their laboratories.                Such an arrangement will give the students in the Southwest an                  opportunity to meet investigators from a specialized discipline                 and reinforce their knowledge about research projects pursued in                their own geographic region.",
