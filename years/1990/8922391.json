An                   important goal of the NBER-CRIW is to bring together empirical                  researchers from government, academia and the private sector,                   primarily from the U.S. The last conference on the service sector               was organized over twenty years ago. In the meantime, this sector               has grown tremendously, and so have public worries about its                    lagging productivity growth. The purpose of the conference is to                focus in particular on measurement, conceptual and definitional                 issues in calibrating and interpreting output and productivity                  growth in various service sector industries.                                                                                                                    The conference is to take place in May in Charleston, South                     Carolina. During the two-day conference period, fifteen papers                  are to be presented and discussed. Papers from this conference,                 as well as discussant's remarks, will be published in the NBER-                 CRIW Conference Series.",
