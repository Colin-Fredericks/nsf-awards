 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer-controlled, high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC)                 is a basic analytical tool and the foremost preparative technique               for solution characterization and separation of organic and                     biochemical materials.  The chemistry department at the                         institution identified as a curricular deficiency the lack of                   opportunity for the students to utilize such instrumentation.                   Alumni had indicated that their preparation for industrial                      employment and graduate study would have been greatly enhanced                  through HPLC experience.  Through this project, the department                  acquired a HPLC system possessing the durability and versatility                to instruct students in organic chemistry laboratory courses and                to enhance the education experience of undergraduates involved in               independent study research projects.  The acquisition of a Waters               DeltaPrep(TM) 3000 HPLC system has helped the department to meet                its curricular goals.                                                                                                                                           The institution has contributed to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
