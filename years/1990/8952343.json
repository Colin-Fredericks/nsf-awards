 "awd_abstract_narration": "The new Electric Energy  Systems (EES) Laboratory brings modern                 digital concepts, presented the most electrical engineering                     students in only a signal or information processing context, into               an electric energy/power laboratory.  Personal computer and                     special purpose microprocessors are used for recording,                         processing, and displaying on-line data taken from systems                      controlling and utilizing electric power.  In addition, these                   computers are also used to actually control power electronic                    interface circuits.  This new state-of-the-art laboratory is                    needed to sustain the energy/power subdiscipline in electrical                  engineering education.                                                                                                                                          In particular, the laboratory will deal with three major    areas:              1. Digitally-based power measurements, including signal                         conditioning, isolation, and computer manipulation and                          display of data.                                                                2. Power electronic devices and interface circuits with control                 signals derived through both analog and digital information                     processing.                                                                     3. Electric energy-transferring, consuming, and conversion                      devices including transducers and rotating                                      electromechanical converters.                                                                                                                                   Student acquire a strong background in electric energy-related                  areas, pertaining to such application as robotics, machine tool                 control, and electric drives for transportation and manufacturing               processes. This laboratory provides this background, though a                   hardware experience with flow-control, mode-conversion, and                     utilization of electric energy using modern digitally-based                     instrumentation and modern power-related instructional components.",
