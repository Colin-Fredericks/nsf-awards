These periodic structures                                      enable efficient frequency conversion, optical                                  switching and dramatically altered dispersion                                   properties.                                                                                                                                                     Frequency Conversion - The origin of efficient                                  second and third-harmonic generation (SHG and                                   THG) in optical glass fibers will be studied.                                   These studies will include writing gratings into                                optical fibers and bulk glasses with a new                                      holographic technique.  This technique involves                                 exposing the outside of the fiber or bulk glass                                 to interference fringes at the right periodicity                                for phasematching of either SHG or THG.  The                                    interference fringes will be produced by an                                     Excimer laser, with a wavelength of 248 nm                                      which is resonant with the GeO molecules in                                     the glass responsible for the photoinduced                                      periodicity.                                                                                                                                                    Optical Switching - It has been shown both                                      theoretically and experimentally that periodic                                  structures can be used for optical switching.                                   Research into the use of the above mentioned                                    holographic technique to write periodic                                         refractive index changes into glass optical fibers                              to obtain switching will be carried out.  The                                   advantage of this method will be that arbitrary                                 periodicities could be obtained by simply                                       changing the angle between the two interfering                                  beams and thereby allowing switching at an                                      arbitrary wavelength.                                                                                                                                           All-Fiber Pulsecompressor - Ultrashort optical                                  pulses can be obtained for wavelengths longer                                   than 1.3 microns in optical fibers due to                                       solitons.  The same type of compression can be                                  obtained for an arbitrary wavelength shorter                                    than 1.3 microns if an periodic refractive index                                perturbation has been written into the fiber.                                   The principal investigator would like to study                                  this further to make an alternative all-fiber                                   pulsecompressor for the visible and near-                                       infrared.",
