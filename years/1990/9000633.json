 "awd_abstract_narration": "The School of Natural and Applied Sciences, Program in Biology at               the University of Houston-Clear Lake is comprised of seven full-                time faculty engaged in a wide variety of research projects within              the area of Cellular and Molecular Biology.  The biology faculty                seek funding to sponsor students from the nine local area community             college systems.  Funding for each year will provide student                    scholarships, registration fees for a three-unit topics course,                 student health insurance for the summer, laboratory supplies for                the research project, and one-month summer salary for the program               director.  The current application is to recruit 14 students per                year for a summer laboratory research internship.  This will offer              the top quality minority and women students form UH-CL's regional               community college population an opportunity to obtain first-hand                experience in a research arena.  The division is extremely active               in supporting undergraduate research.  The participating faculty                have published or submitted 28 papers co-authored by undergraduates             in the last five years.  Over 50 undergraduate students have                    participated in research activities in our laboratories since 1983.",
