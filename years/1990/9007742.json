 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with botanists of the Philippines National                Museum, Drs. Sy Sohmer and Benjamin Stone of Hawaii's Bishop                    Museum are initiating an intensive plant collecting program                     throughout the Philippines, as phase one of a comprehensive                     inventory of the estimated 10,000-12,000 species of ferns,                      conifers, and flowering plants of that tropical island nation.                  The plant collections of the National Herbarium, virtually                      destroyed at the end of World War II, will be augmented                         significantly, and U.S. and European botanists will aid in the                  identification and study of the thousands of new specimens.                     Scientists from the University of the Philippines are also                      participating in this biodiversity inventory.                                        As specimens begin to accumulate from field teams throughout               the country, staff at the Philippines National Museum will enter                information into computer databases modeled upon similar ones                   implemented at the Bishop Museum.  Initial priority for field                   collecting is being given to forested regions under consideration               for protection or otherwise of interest to conservation agencies.               The inventory will also be of use to resource managers and others               who must have up-to-date knowledge of species identity,                         geographical distribution, local uses and names, and ecological                 condition--common, rare, or extinct--for the plants of the                      Philippines.  A published identification guide to the plants is                 one of the long-term goals of the collaboration.",
