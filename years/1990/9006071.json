 "awd_abstract_narration": "In warmer habitats, plants possessing the C4 photosynthetic                pathway have higher photosynthetic rates, greater potential                     productivity and greater competitive potential than the more                    common C3 species.  The vast majority of C4 plants, including the               economically important species such as corn and sugar cane, are                 limited to habitats which are worm and sunny.  Since 1982,                      however, several species of the C4 grass Muhlenbergia have been                 discovered in forest understory habitats at light  levels                       significantly lower than normal for C4 plants.                                       This project investigates the photosynthetic responses of                  Muhlenbergia sobolifera, the most shade-tolerant C4 species                     known, to determine if it uses both photosynthetic pathways,                    either concurrently or in response to environmental cues.                       Because M. sobolifera is thought to have evolved regressively                   from the more common high-light, fully-functional C4 plants, an                 understanding of its metabolic pathway will provide scientists                  valuable insight into the environmental pressures which lead to                 the evolution of photosynthetic pathways.  In addition, this                    knowledge may lead to breeding approaches for producing plants                  with the desirable characteristic of both photosynthetic types.",
