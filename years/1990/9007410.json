 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both genetic and molecular analyses of Drosophila have clearly                  demonstrated that homeobox containing genes are intimately                      involved in the establishment of the body plan. Using molecular                 probes from Drosophila the vertebrate homeobox containing gene                  counterparts were isolated. However, there is no clear evidence                 demonstrating that the homeobox containing genes play a similar                 role in vertebrates. This proposal is focused on analyzing the                  function of a maternally expressed homeobox containing gene,                    X1Hox 2, in the frog Xenopus laevis. Dr. Etkin's preliminary data               show that the X1Hox 2 mRNA is localized in the animal hemisphere                in full grown oocytes and that destruction of the maternal mRNA                 by injection of  antisense oligodeoxynucleotides results in a                   specific defect in the neural tube.  Dr. Etkin hypothesis is that               this gene plays a fundamental role in the regulatory gene                       hierarchy in early Xenopus development.  He will test this                      hypothesis by accomplishing the following specific aims: 1)                     define the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of the                    X1Hox 2 gene using in situ hybridization, RNase protection                      assays, and immunostaining of the protein in tissue sections and                whole mounts 2) analysis of how this gene is regulated during                   development by examining the role of cell cell interactions and                 autoregulation on its expression, as well as characterizing the                 putative target genes that the X1Hox 2 gene product may activate                at the gastrula stage and 3) determine the function of the X1Hox                2 gene using several approaches including a novel combination of                antisense oligodeoxynucleotide injection, maturation, and                       fertilization of oocytes in vitro.                                              %%%                                                                             The analysis of this gene and its product will be important in                  the formulation of basic principles of how homeobox containing                  genes function in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan.",
