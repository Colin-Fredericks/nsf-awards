 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in systems theory                between Dr. Peter Crouch, Arizona State University and Dr.                      Francoise Lamnabhi-Lagarrigue, Laboratoire de Signaux et Systemes,              Ecole Superieure d'Electricite, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.  The                    objective of the proposed project is the development of efficient               computational algorithms for nonlinear control systems using                    algebraic and combinatorial algorithms.                                                                                                                         The scientific benefit of the proposed research arises from the                 fact that, unlike the situation for linear systems, the current                 new theories for nonlinear control systems have not yet developed               sufficiently for their widespread acceptance by the industrial                  designers of modern control technology.  The linear theory is now               developed to a stage where the computer is used not only as a tool              to implement control algorithms as an integral part of the                      physical plant, but also in the automated design of the algorithms.             Conversely, in the case of nonlinear systems, the complexity of                 the design problems are such that, even though sometime it is                   possible to prove the existence of solutions, it is usually not                 possible to formulate the solutions in a manner that is computa-                tionally implementable.  This project is aimed at addressing these              issues through the use of mathematical and numerical techniques                 and symbolic computation.  The successful outcome of this project               will be of great assistance in the design of controllers for                    complex systems, such as robots, space stations and aircraft.  The              project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the two                investigators in nonlinear systems theory and their past history                of successful collaboration.",
