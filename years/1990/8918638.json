 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                    chemistry, and in the subfield of mass spectrometry.  Professor                 Murray Johnston will study the laser photodissociation and                      photoionization of hydrocarbon molecules containing four to ten                 carbon atoms.  An important objective of the program is to                      identify mechanisms of fragmentations of molecules after they                   have been photoionized.  This will lead to more specific means                  of determining structure in large molecules from controlled                     fragmentations in mass spectrometry.  This will improve the                     determination of complex hydrocarbon mixtures, such as                          hydrocarbon fuels and oils, which is accomplished by mass                       spectrometry.                                                                                                                                                   The research to be conducted will focus on ultraviolet and                      vacuum ultraviolet unimolecular photochemistry and                              photodissociation of alkanes and alkenes.  The main objective                   is to understand charge remote fragmentation and the                            localization of charge in \"soft\" photoionization processes.                     This novel approach will allow for more controlled                              photofragmentation, and will be compared with electron impact                   and chemical ionization techniques.  Gas phase alkanes and                      alkenes will be photodissociated by an excimer laser and the                    photoproducts photoionized by 118 nm photons.  Time of Flight                   mass spectrometric detection will be utilized.  Relative                        abundances of specific fragments will be used to understand                     branching.  The minimization of rearrangements upon                             fragmentation with this method should allow cleaner                             interpretation of structure in mass spectrometry.",
