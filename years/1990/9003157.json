 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Drs. David Chih-yuen Koo, Joseph S.                     Miller, and Lloyd B. Robinson of the University of California                   Lick Observatory in a research collaboration with Dr. Gustavo                   Bruzual of the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia (CIDA)                   in Merida, Venezuela.  The purpose of the collaboration is to                   establish a long-term joint program involving two parts: the                    first involves travel and data-transfer support for a pilot                     instrumentation project to develop a large-format electronic                    (CCD) camera for use on the new CIDA 1-meter Schmidt telescope.                 Lick and CIDA astronomers will then use this powerful                           combination to undertake various extensive new photometric                      and synoptic surveys of joint scientific interest.  One of                      these will be a major new long-term observational survey of                     20 areas in the sky.  Among many potential programs using                       these data will be a multicolor photometric survey to study                     the luminosity function of galaxies and a synoptic program to                   search for very distant supernovae.  The second part of the                     collaboration will attempt to develop new quantitative                          methods of analyzing extensive multidimensional data, aimed                     mainly at exploring the evolution of galaxies and cosmology.                                                                                                    Major observational surveys are some of the most productive                     astronomical tools to understand the universe.  Such surveys                    allow astronomers to measure distributions of properties of                     known objects and also to discover new, rare, or unusual                        classes of objects.  Despite their importance, photometric                      surveys that cover large areas, synoptic programs, or any                       long-term projects are all particularly difficult to undertake                  in today's climate of scarce telescope time.  The CIDA                          observatory in Venezuela has recently finished the construction                 of a 1-meter Schmidt telescope that has overall optical                         properties similar to the one at Palomar and is the among the                   three largest in the northern hemisphere.  The collaborators'                   plan to develop imaging cameras for the telescope at CIDA using                 charge coupled detectors (CCDs) of very large format developed                  at the Detector Laboratory at Lick, plus the ability of CIDA                    to provide dedicated observers time for long-term surveys                       should allow astronomers to undertake a variety of new                          surveys of unprecedented depth, time and areal coverage.",
