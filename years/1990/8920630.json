It is commonly believed                in the United States that the quality of life in rural and small                towns is preferable to that found in large urban areas.  The                    objective of this research is to compare the quality of life for                individuals who work in small machine-tool companies located in                 rural, semi-rural, and urban areas of western Pennsylvania, and to              ascertain what factors contribute to the degree of satisfaction                 that these individuals have with their lives.  An in-depth                      ethnography of the small machine-tool companies in the region will              be developed, including a survey of workers' satisfaction with                  their jobs, leisure, communities, and lives in general.  Research               methods will include traditonal anthropological field techniques,               including observation, interviews, and the use of key informants,               as well as the experience sampling method, local and regional                   surveys, and the use of written and physical stimulus materials in              sorting and ranking tasks.  Results will include presentations at               professional society meetings, book chapters, and articles in a                 wide variety of journals.                                                                                                                                       This research will further knowledge of quality of rural and urban              life, technological development in rural and urban areas, the                   influence of automation on work and worker satisfaction, and the                relationships among work, leisure, community, and life satisfaction             of employees of these shops.  The investigators are very well                   qualified; and the research design and methods of collection and                analysis are very sophisticated.  Results will be of interest to                a broad audiences of policymakers as well as academics.  Support                is highly recommended.",
