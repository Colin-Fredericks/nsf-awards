 "awd_abstract_narration": "Observational astronomy is both a science and an art.  While the                science can be taught in the classroom, real understanding of                   telescopes, detectors, and data acquisition requires hands on                   experience at an observatory.  Most undergraduate students receive              little direct exposure to observational astronomy with                          instrumentation and computing facilities comparable to those found              at major observatories.  Over the past two years the Five College               Astronomy Department has been supporting an upgrade of a local 40cm             Boller and Chivens reflector.  The goal this project is to provide              an environment for students which, in as many was as possible,                  simulates the key aspects of modern telescopic observing.  The                  availability of state-of-the-art infrared instrumentation which has             been installed on this small telescope not only provides                        undergraduates with invaluable laboratory experience but also enables           them to carry out research projects competitive in both quality and             significance to those performed at the largest telescope facilities.            The department is continuing the upgrade by incorporating a low-                light camera for remote source acquisition and guiding, upgrading the           data acquisition computer to accomodate a new high data-rate                    detection system, and providing students with access to professional            data reduction and analysis computing facilities.  The consortium is            matching the award with an equal amount of funds.//",
