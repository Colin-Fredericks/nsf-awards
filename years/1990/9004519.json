 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the evolutionary patterns of                     gastropod shell biota from subtropical and tropical Miocene to                  Recene assemblanges as a function of ecological opportunities and               preservational biases created by hermit crabs.                                       PI will study shell bionts associated with a guild of marine               hermit crabs, living snails, empty and experimental tethered                    shells in two habitats (rocky intertidal and sandflat) in Purerto               Penasco, Mexico.                                                                     I will identify guilds of bionts associated with each shell                inhabitant and formulate criteria by which these shell occupants                (snail or hermit crab), and their prospective habitats, can be                  recognized in the fossil record.                                                     I will then determine, using the fossil record, if these                   bionts are (1) recurrent as guilds or change through time as a                  result of hermit crabs providing a novel substrate (the empty                   gastropod shell), (2) adequate to distingush the evolutionary                   history of the hermit crab, and (3) indicative of how much the                  gastropod fossil record has been biased by hermit crabs, thus                   potentially biasing gastropod paleoecology.  Hermit crabs may                   have caused evolutionary breakthroughs in shell biota and this                  biota, in turn, may be indicative of the little known fossil                    history of hermit crabs and their shell use through time.                       Research will address how ecoligcal interactions may have changed               through time.",
