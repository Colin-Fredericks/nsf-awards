 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will give intensive training over a three-year                     period in astronomy and science teaching strategies to 60                       teachers of grades five to eight from Central Texas                             elementary and middle schools.  The project will be a                           cooperative effort involving the College of Natural Science                     and the School of Education of the University of Texas at                       Austin, McDonald Observatory, and many Central Texas school                     districts.  Three members of the Astronomy Department will                      conduct the classes.  In addition, a professor from the                         Science Education Center and two master school teachers (one                    from a rural elementary school and one from an urban middle                     school, both Christa McAuliffe Fellows) will help prepare and                   present the program.                                                                                                                                            Each year, for three years, 20 participants will attend the                     university for a three-semester Institute in Astronomy. In                      the Fall semester they will perform hands-on inquiry-based                      activities and field exercises in astronomy in order to                         receive three hours of upper division undergraduate Astronomy                   credit.  In the Spring semester they will learn strategies                      for presenting workshops, prepare a resource manual                             ofinexpensive materials and ideas for teaching astronomy to                     children, and receive three hours of upper division credit in                   Science.  The Fall and Spring meetings will occur on sixteen                    Thursday evenings and seven Saturdays.  The evening meetings                    are essential to give the participants direct experience of                     astronomical phenomena.  In the summer, the participants will                   live together for three-weeks as they update their knowledge                    about modern astronomy and astronomy instrumentation.  During                   the two-week Austin session, they will attend lectures and                      learn to use astronomical instruments on the Astronomy                          Department's Cassegrain-focus research caliber 16-inch                          telescope.  Following their training, the participants will                     share in the experiences of a research astronomer through a                     three night observing run at the University of Texas McDonald                   Observatory in west Texas, 450 miles west of Austin in the                      Davis Mountains.  At the observatory, they will live with the                   astronomers, tour the facilities and use the 30-inch and/or                     36-inch telescope for their own projects.  McDonald                             Observatory is providing six nights of telescope time per-                      year at no cost to the project.  Three hours of graduate                        credit in astronomy is awarded upon completion of this                          portion of the program.                                                                                                                                         In addition, an astronomer will interact with the science                       classes taught by each of the participants through visits to                    their school.  Although many visits will be made by the                         principal investigator (offering a female role model), over                     20 other members of the Astronomy Department have volunteered                   to visit classrooms.  Non-federal funding is provided for                       these visits.                                                                   Besides increasing the confidence of the participants in the                    teaching of science and improving their own backgrounds,                        another aim of the program is train them as science workshop                    presenters to teachers of grades two through eight.  All                        participants have the support of their own districts which                      will provide the facilities and materials for conducting at                     least two grade specific workshops.  The districts will also                    provide support for the participants to attend two follow-up                    meetings of science teachers.                                                                                                                                   In summary, this program will develop a continuing                              collaborative partnership among scientists, science                             educators, and local schools as it improves the quality of                      astronomy instruction in elementary and middle schools in                       central Texas.                                                                                                                                                  Cost sharing in the amount of $126,914 is equal to 33% of the                   NSF award.",
