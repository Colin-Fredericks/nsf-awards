 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Peter Wolynes is supported by a grant from The                        Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to continue his                 studies in the nonequilibrium statistical mechanics of                          condensed systems.  He is applying theoretical statistical                      mechanics and numerical simulation techniques to studies of                     electron transfer in biomolecular systems, and to solvation                     dynamics and chemical dynamics in glassy systems.  The results                  obtained from such studies provide a molecular level                            interpretation of important physical and biological processes.                                                                                                  Professor Wolynes is conducting theoretical research in two                     specific areas.  First, he is investigating electron transfer                   and recombination reactions in biomolecules, using path                         integral simulations appropriate for studying the deep                          tunneling regime.  His studies in this area will help to                        determine the role of real time quantum interference effects                    and dephasing in such rate processes.  The second area of                       research involves a continuation of his studies of glass                        transitions using computer simulation and renormalization group                 approaches.  He plans to examine the problem of the glass                       transition in systems of confined geometry and make comparisons                 with NMR experiments as well as tribological experiments.",
