 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every spring large numbers of horseshoe crabs migrate to beaches                along the Atlantic coast.  Females, with males attached, bury in                the sand, laying eggs which the male fertilizes externally.                     Unattached males aggregate around nesting pairs and evidence                    suggests that they also fertilize eggs.  The proposed field study               will characterize the unusual reproductive behavior of this                     species.  The proportion of offspring fathered by attached and                  unattached males will be determined using DNA fingerprinting.                   Descriptive observations, measurements of marked populations and                experimental manipulations will quantify nesting and mating                     behavior, and differences between populations. Limulus is unique.               The Xiphosurida are the only extant arthropods with the primitive               pattern of external fertilization and aquatic, free-swimming                    sperm.  A study of their breeding will provide insight into the                 ancestors of modern arthropods.  Furthermore, although Limulus is               one of the best-studied species on the planet, little is known                  about their reproduction.  This field study will provide a                      valuable context for, and will take advantage of, research on                   other aspects of their biology.  Finally, because of their                      synchronized, semi-lunar breeding and external fertilization,                   Limulus mating shows profound similarities to explosively                       breeding amphibians.  Therefore, the study of Limulus may provide               an independent test of theories on the evolution of mating                      systems.",
