 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a program of activities and experiences for                     students in grades K-6, particularly disabled and limited                       English Proficiency students, with a focus on encouraging                       disabled students to pursue studies leading to technological                    careers.  It provides opportunities for disabled scientists to                  serve as role models for disabled students, and helps all                       students and teachers overcome biases against disabled people.                  It also encourages teachers and administrators to work together                 to make decisions concerning their schools' science programs.                                                                                                   By the end of the 2-year program, 60 disabled scientists,                       engineers and technicians will have attended one of two 150-hour                training institutes, and have developed conceptual, multimodal                  science lessons, which they will have presented to various                      combinations of teachers and students in at least 40 elementary                 schools. Each school will have received approximately 50 hours-                 per-year of Scientists' teaching time.  Teachers and principals                 will have worked together to determine how, when, by whom, and                  to whom the lessons will be presented.  The second year expands                 the number of Scientists and lessons and permits teachers and                   principals involved in the first year to participate in                         improving all                                                                   elements of the program.",
