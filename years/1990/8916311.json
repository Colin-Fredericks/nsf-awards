 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will determine how desaturation of membrane lipid                 fatty acids is regulated.  Because it has not been possible to                  characterize most of the membrane-bound enzymes which catalyze                  fatty acid desaturation by conventional methods, the small family               of genes encoding the desaturases will be cloned.  The cloned                   genes and antibodies against the products of these genes will                   then be used to measure the amount of desaturase gene products                  and to examine the effect on membrane lipid composition of                      quantitative variation in the amount of desaturase in transgenic                plants.  The proposed approach will exploit a unique collection                 of mutants of Arabidopsis with alterations in fatty acid                        desaturation to facilitate the isolation and characterization of                the family of desaturase genes.                                                                                                                                 Fatty acid unsaturation is a determinant of the quality and                     economic value of the product from oilseed species.  Because of                 the importance of nutritional fatty acids from plants in human                  health it would be advantageous to be able to control the degree                of unsaturation of the lipids in the harvested tissue of crop                   species so that they can be tailored to meet our nutritional                    needs.  This could be extremely cost effective.  Many conceivable               mechanisms of understanding of how the desaturases act, how they                are regulated, and having the relevant genes in hand.  Inasmuch                 as the same enzymes appear to regulate both membrane and storage                lipid composition, the goals of this proposal represent tangible                steps in this direction.",
