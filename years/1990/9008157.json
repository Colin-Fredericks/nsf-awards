 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal offers new insights into the sources of cooperative               behavior in small-group situations involving prisoners' dilemma                 games.  Previous analyses have explained the behavior either by                 assuming supplementary incentives or by assuming that cooperators               are capable of recognizing defectors.  Both approaches place                    substantial demands on human cognitive capacities that appear                   unreasonable.                                                                                                                                                   The present approach, in contrast, is based on an alternative                   heuristic involving two decisions: (1) whether to participate, and              if so,  (2) how to participate.  This approach provides a basis for             studying the evolution of cooperative behavior.  The ideas will be              tested using a new experimental paradigm that holds particular                  promise.  The proposed approach offers advances both theoretically              and empirically.  In particular, the results of this research will              define conditions under which cooperative behavior tends to breed               cooperation.  Because the focus is on cooperation rather than                   competition, the proposed research should provide new understanding             of small-group behavior.",
