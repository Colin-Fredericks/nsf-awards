 "awd_abstract_narration": "The resource potential of deep-water marine minerals has                        been brought into focus with the establishment of 200-mile                      offshore Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) by the world's                          coastal and island nations.  A variety of programs is                           currently underway in the United States and several other                       nations for evaluating the potential deep seabed mineral                        resources that exist within national jurisdictions.                                                                                                             Collection of outcrop samples from consolidated seabed                          mineral deposits is essential for deposit characterization                      but is a tedious and inaccurate process with presently                          available technology.  Dredging, which is still the only                        common method, is notoriously imprecise and biased toward                       collection of protruding and loose rocks rather than                            representative in-place material.  The project proposed                         here has the potential to replace dredging for                                  reconnaissance surveys of hard seabed mineral deposits                          with a precise, rapid and unbiased method based upon an                         untethered free-fall sampler.",
