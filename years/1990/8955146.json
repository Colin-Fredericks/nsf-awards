 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 40-month project provides courses and internship                           activities for teachers of science who have a minimal                           background in the science they are teaching. The project will                   teach content, develop hands-on laboratory activities and                       provide an internship experience to follow up on the                            coursework to assure the implementation of new approaches in                    the classroom. The target schools have a large minority                         population (60% Black, Hispanic, Asian, Filipino, Pacific                       Islanders) and have not been traditionally strong in the                        sciences. In addition to basic science courses, advanced, or                    enrichment, courses will be offered to those who reach the                      appropriate level of preparation. A total of 252 teachers                       will be involved in the project over its three year duration.                   The project will be advised by a Planning Committee which                       consists of teachers, school administrators, local                              representatives of business and industry, and University                        personnel. Design teams will be chosen from the schools to                      aid in the development of the course curriculum.  The NSF                       portion of the total project cost is $792,688 matched by                        $191,569 of institutional support. Thus the cost share is                       approximately 24%.",
