 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Kent Lightfoot, Professor of                         Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, Mr. Aron                Crowell will conduct archaeological fieldwork and analysis to                   collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  Mr. Crowell will                   conduct a two year program of investigation at the site of Three                Saints Bay located on Kodiak Island, Alaska.  A village at this                 site was established in 1784 by Grigorii Shelikhov as a fur trade               outpost and constituted the first permanent Russian settlement in               Alaska.  The goals of the settlement were to pacify the local                   Koniag Indians, to use them to exploit the untapped sea otter                   resources in the region, and to establish a permanent, largely                  self-sustaining outpost for the organization and administration                 of fur procurement.  The Russians succeeded, at least                           temporarily, and the site was not abandoned until the early to                  mid-nineteenth century.                                                                                                                                         Mr. Crowell and his colleagues will conduct a remote sensing                    survey of the site to locate structural remains and then excavate               a series of houses.  Through recovery and analysis of artifactual               and faunal remains, they will attempt to reconstruct settlers'                  lifeways and their relations with local inhabitants.  The team                  will also excavate in the associated Koniag Indian village to                   determine the effect of the immigrants.  This contact situation                 is extremely interesting because interactions between native                    Americans and European/Asian settlers and merchants were                        extremely variable, and the Kodiak case illustrates a rare                      situation of direct dominance and economic exploitation.                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons.  It will increase               our understanding of the processes of culture contact and change.               It will also help to fill in a blank in the record of North                     American colonization, and, finally, it will assist in the                      training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
