 "awd_abstract_narration": "Institutions of law play a pivotal role in maintaining or                       undermining stability in societies, especially deeply divided                   societies fractured along racial, ethnic, or religious lines.                   Policing in such situations has been characterized as having                    little accountability to and little legitimacy in major segments                of the community.  Despite the importance of understanding law                  enforcement processes, the social science literature lacks                      studies of the police in divided societies, particularly primary                research that is theoretically and empirically robust.                                                                                                          This study examines a series of theoretical questions on the role               of policing in a deeply divided society.  The focus of the                      research is on the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.               This is an apt context for examining policing because it allows                 for comparative and longitudinal analysis of a polarized society                under two very different political systems, Protestant (1921-                   1972) and British (1972-present) rule. Three analytical theses                  derived from the literature are addressed--the instrumentalist                  thesis, the functionality thesis, and the fortification thesis.                 The research will examine how the role of the police has evolved                along with changes in the political structure and in particular                 whether the movement toward police normalization affects the                    links between the police and the divided community.  The research               design will consist of systematic interviews with community and                 religious leaders, government officials, politicians, and the                   police; direct observation of police activity; and collection of                reports, documents, and newspaper accounts.  The data will be                   analyzed with the help of secondary studies of the police in                    other divided and integrated societies.                                                                                                                         This study should have major implications for understanding the                 various ways in which the police affect and are affected by their               social and political environment.  Not only will it contribute to               knowledge about societies which are institutionally and                         culturally divided, but also it will contribute to understanding                of policing in more integrated, ethnically diverse, societies                   such as in the United States.  Issues of legitimacy, impartial                  law enforcement, use of force, and accountability have effects on               police-minority relations that are not unlike the effects in                    deeply divided societies.  A general theory of policing in                      societies will be developed by connecting policing to communal                  divisions and grievances.  The comparative, longitudinal                        framework will highlight both changes and continuities over time                and offer insights about the opportunities and limits of reform.",
