 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Fosket has isolated and sequenced two soybean beta-tubulin                  genes (SB1 and SB2) which exhibit different patterns of                         developmental and organ specific expression. However, both genes                are expressed in elongating internodes and they are strongly and                rapidly down regulated at the transcriptional level when                        etiolated seedlings are exposed to light. He will determine the                 nature of the cis-acting elements controlling the internodal                    expression of SB1 and SB2. Constructs in which a promoterless E.                coli beta-glucosidase (GUS) reporter gene is driven by the SB1                  and SB2 promoters have been made and transferred to tobacco by                  Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and the chimeric genes are               expressed in the transgenic tobacco plants. The effect of                       deletions and mutations of the putative promoter regions of SB1                 and SB2 on the expression of the GUS reporter gene in                           transgenic tobacco will be determined to identify the regulatory                elements responsible both for their expression in elongating                    internodes and for their light induced down regulation. GUS                     enzymatic activity assays and S1 nuclease protection experiments                will be used to verify that GUS enzymatic activity is a                         reflection of the transcriptional activity of the chimeric genes.               The precise cellular localization of GUS activity in the                        transgenic tobacco plants will be determined histochemically,                   while the cell specific expression of the SB1 and SB2 genes in                  soybean internodes will be  will be determined by means of in                   situ hybridizations, using labeled, gene specific probes.                       Additionally, SB1 and SB2 specific antibodies will be generated                 and used to ascertain which microtubule arrays contain these                    tubulins. The trans-acting factors regulating the transcription                 of the SB1 and SB2 tubulin genes in soybean internodal tissues                  will be identified by means of footprinting and gel retardation                 assays. These DNA binding regulatory proteins will be isolated by               affinity chromatography and the nature of their interaction with                SB1 and SB2 promoter elements will be studied. Antibodies raised                to these DNA binding proteins will be used to isolate cDNAs                     encoding them from a lambda gt11 expression library. The cDNAs                  will be used as probes to examine the regulation of expression of               the genes encoding these DNA binding proteins.                                  %%%                                                                             In plants microtubules are an important subcellular component                   involved in determining how cells expand and as a consequence,                  how tissues grow. This study will elucidate how the expression of               a microtubule protein is expressed during plant growth and in                   response to light.",
