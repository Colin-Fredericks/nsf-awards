 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project improves the quality of instruction of upper level                 courses in computer science in artificial intelligence by providing             students with a laboratory of powerful, interconnected workstations             and a modern programming environment which integrates artificial                intelligence (AI) techniques, graphics, windowing systems, and                  object-oriented programming.  With this equipment, students                     majoring in computer science, computer engineering, and physics are             able to develop advanced software projects, utilizing the state-                of-the-art software tools of graphics, windowing facilities, LISP,              Prolog, an expert system shell, and object-oriented programming                 tools.  Also, students in senior research projects, independent                 study projects, and in the honors program are able to develop                   sophisticated AI software using this laboratory.  These experiences             with advanced software will provide better preparation for students             who wish to go on to graduate school as well as those who pursue                careers in industry.  The award is being matched by an equal amount             from the principal investigator's institution.",
