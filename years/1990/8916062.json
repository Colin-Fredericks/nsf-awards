 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taste specificity in the vertebrates is shown by activity in                    specific single nerve fibers.  Peripheral receptor cells in taste               bud organs can be classified into types based on morphology and                 ultrastructural features.  Individual nerve fibers may innervate                subpopulations of these receptor cells that are specifically                    activated by certain stimuli, but the evidence to date is scarce                and controversial.                                                                                                                                              This project is a pilot study to find out if classes of taste                   cells that are distinguishable by structural criteria respond                   preferentially to given chemical stimuli.  The preparation will                 be from taste barbels of catfish because they are a very well                   studied model physiological system, able to discriminate among                  several chemical compounds.  There are three novel aspects to the               approach: 1) use of a metabolic label (2-deoxyglucose) for                      ultrastructural studies, 2) autoradiography with high-voltage                   electron microscopy, and 3) high-pressure rapid freezing for                    tissue preparation.  The pilot work will determine if this                      approach yields useful information on the structure and function                of the taste cells, and if the cells form functional clusters.                  This innovative project has a great potential impact on an                      important issue in chemosensory research, and on developing new                 technology for cellular  biological studies.",
