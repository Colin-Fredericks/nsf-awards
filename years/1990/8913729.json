 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents an interdisciplinary,                              collaborative effort between the principal investigator and                     scientists at NOAA's Aeronomy Laboratory and the National                       Center for Atmospheric Research.  It consists of a study of the                 stratosphere involving elements of dynamics, transport, and                     chemistry.  In order to understand distributions of ozone and                   other chemical species, the dynamical processes responsible for                 mixing and transport must be understood.  Of particular                         interest is the role of transient eddies in the transport of                    chemical species form the equatorial to polar regions.  The                     evolution of the stratospheric flow is quite complex:  the                      periodic displacement and distortion of the polar vortex                        results in very small-scale, asymmetric distributions of                        chemical species that cannot be adequately resolved temporally                  or spatially by existing observing systems.  The goal of this                   project is to develop a high (horizontal) resolution numerical                  model to further investigate this phenomenon and to identify                    the physical mechanisms involved.  Because the stratosphere is                  characterized by flows of deep vertical extent, the co-                         investigators will employ a two-dimensional model to look at                    the interaction between eddy transport and photochemistry.  In                  addition, they will explore the role of polar stratospheric                     clouds in altering the photochemistry of the stratosphere.                           This results of this research will have important                          implications for understanding of both atmospheric dynamics and                 atmospheric chemistry.",
