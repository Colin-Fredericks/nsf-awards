 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed program of undergraduate laboratory research experiences           is based on a strong experimental research program using modern lab             facilities in all principal subareas of civil and environmental                 engineering.  The program is designed to generate excitement,                   motivations and research commitment  by undergraduate students through          hands-on lab research experiments performed with the guidance of                experienced senior researchers.   Students will be matched with the             following laboratories, based on their interest, backgrounds, and               talents: Concrete and Construction Materials, Environmental                     Engineering, Hydraulics, Remote Sensing, and Structural Engineering.            The students could work in pairs.  The program is building on a very            successful REU program in civil and environmental engineering in the            summer of 1989.                                                                 Each laboratory program has a faculty member as co-principal                    investigator in charge.  A carefully thought-out evaluation, feedback           and interaction mechanism  has been designed to assure that the                 undergraduate lab research experience will be enticement for talented           students to think seriously about advanced studies in engineering.              The proposal identifies a great number of research activities with              which the students will be matched, based on interest and talent.  A            strong minority recruitment, and advising and counseling program will           assure that the interested minority students can be identified and              recruited.",
