 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provide funds to develop a hypermedia based learning                 environment for a course in the economics of industry in the                    Department of Economics at Miami University.  Hypermedia/hypertext              materials will be developed for use by junior and senior                        undergraduate students that supplement the standard textbook and                lecture materials.  The hypertext materials will derive from                    general and professional literature on the issues not normally                  accessible to students.  Students explore the hypermedia materials              at a computerized workstation within an integrated software                     environment.  Explorations by students arise from both assigned                 analyses and student motivated review of topics.  The integrated                software environment allows the student to undertake assignments                from start to finish, at the workstation.  The computer equipment               consists of one network server, ten student workstations, and two               network printers.  The network server functions as the repository               for the hypermedia data and software.  A student workstation                    provides the access to the hypermedia material while two network                printers are for output of students assignments.  The project                   provides a framework for accessing and analyzing large amounts of               diverse information in hypermedia format by the students.  The                  hypermedia environment will be able to change and grow as                       understanding of the topic material improves.  The university will              provide 50% matching funds from non-Federal sources.",
