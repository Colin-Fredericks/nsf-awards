 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science is a problem-solving activity.  This project will explore             strategies for solving problems, especially strategies for forming,             testing and revising hypotheses.  In previous work, strategies                  exemplified in a historical case were analyzed, including strategies            for resolving anomalies for a theory and for producing an improved              version of the theory.  This project will test the sufficiency of such          strategies in a computer model, using techniques from artificial                intelligence.  The model will provide a method for representing a               biological theory (Mendelian genetics) and will incorporate reasoning           strategies to model changes in that theory.  Experiments with                   alternative reasoning strategies will be explored with the model.               The completion of this project will contribute to the growing body of           knowledge about computational methods for representing scientific               theories and reasoning about such theories.                                       Interactive activities include teaching a graduate course on                  computational philosophy of science, giving two departmental                    colloquia presentations, and, with support from the Cognitive Science           Center, organizing a symposium on Career Opportunities for Women in             Cognitive Science.                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a                      valuable investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
