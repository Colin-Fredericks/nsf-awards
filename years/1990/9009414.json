 "awd_abstract_narration": "Redundance control is always considered as one of the most challenging          problems to the automation of reasoning, because of combinatorial               explosion in inferences generated during the search of solutions (of            any non-trivial problems).  This project will investigate a powerful            inference rule called clausal superposition, which combines resolution          and paramodulation together, but generates much less inferences.  This          project will also investigate a simplification rule called contextual           rewriting, which identifies many unnecessary inferences and is more             powerful than demodulation and subsumption together.  The approach              taken in this project is based on well-founded term orderings, which            play a central role in the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure and                rewriting methods for equational reasoning.                                                                                                                     In this project, results of theoretical investigation will also be              implemented and experimented with in a software system called the               Rewrite Rule Laboratory (RRL), an environment for experimenting with            and developing new automated reasoning procedures based on rewrite              methods. This research will increase the power of RRL for solving               problems in verification and specification of hardware and software,            as well as those considered a challenge for automated theorem provers.",
