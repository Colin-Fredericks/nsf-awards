 "awd_abstract_narration": "How neurons make synaptic connections with the correct cells                    during the development of the nervous system is still largely a                 mystery.  It is clear that the guidance of growing nerve cell                   processes (axons) to appropriate regions of the developing                      nervous system, where their future target cells reside, places                  constraints on which neurons can ultimately connect with each                   other.  However, even within a small region there exist neurons                 with very different functions, and growing nerve axons must be                  able to recognize these different neuronal types and choose only                the ones appropriate for them to make connections with.  This                   project will examine the mechanisms by which neurons that                       normally innervate muscle fibers (motoneurons) discriminate                     between different muscles.  One possibility is that each muscle                 is unique in some way that motoneurons axons can recognize.  A                  way to achieve this would be for muscle fibers to carry a                       molecular label of some kind that distinguishes them from muscle                fibers in other muscles.  Dr. Wigston will examine this                         possibility by searching for molecules unique to, or highly                     concentrated in, a particular muscle, by generating monoclonal                  antibody probes that bind selectively to particular muscles.                    Another possibility is that each muscle secretes its own                        diffusible factor that attracts the axons of only those                         motoneurons appropriate for that muscle.  This possibility will                 be examined by culturing pieces of spinal cord and muscle near to               one another, and determining whether particular axons grow                      preferentially towards particular muscles.  Furthermore, using                  various experimental designs, isolated motoneurons will be grown                in tissue culture and their selectivity for different muscles                   examined.  If selective synapse formation occurs in such a                      system, it will provide tremendous opportunities for the                        elucidation of the mechanism by which selectivity is achieved.                  This work should help us to understand how the correct \"wiring                  pattern\" is laid down in the developing neurons system, and in                  particular how the right motoneurons connect with the right                     muscles during embryogenesis.  The normal functioning of the                    brain, and normal behavior of the organism, is critically                       dependent on the establishment of proper orderly neuronal                       connectivity.",
