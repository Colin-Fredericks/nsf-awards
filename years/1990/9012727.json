It will build upon a                                 preliminary study conducted in 1985 in Tianjin,                                 China's third largest city.  It is sponsored                                    jointly by the NSF and the Tianjin Academy of                                   Social Sciences.                                                                                                                                                The investigators will try to determine how                                     Chinese search for and find jobs by conducting a                                sample survey of 2,000 presently employed males and                             females between the ages of 18 and 60 who have                                  entered the labor force since 1949 (the founding                                of the People's Republic of China).  The                                        \u001ainvestigators have assumed that it is more                                     important for the Chinese to enter into the                                     \"right\" work units than to find \"good\" jobs.  The                               \"right\" work units tend to be in the state sector,                              under the direct jurisdiction of the central                                    government.  The work units under other, lower.level                            governments, called the collective sector, tend to                              be less prestigious because they pay less, have                                 fewer promotions, have less fringe benefits, and                                have less authority relative to the state.owned                                 work units.  The investigators will test the                                    following hypotheses:  (1) males rather than                                    females are more likely to enter into the state                                 sector and work units, (2) males are more likely                                than females to be helped by their family (parents                              and relatives) than females in getting into the                                 state sector, (3) males are more likely than                                    females to find social connections through family                               ties to enter into the state sector.                                                                                                                            The study will increase our understanding of social                             connections in contemporary Chinese society, which                              is undergoing rapid economic and social change.                                 It will also help make comparisons across different                             societies and cultures (e.g., comparing with North                              American and European countries) as to how people                               move ahead successfully in their careers.                                                                                                                       .\fU2.",
