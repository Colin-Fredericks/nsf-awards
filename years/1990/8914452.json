 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Jon                  Zubieta, State University of New York at Albany, and Dr. Yves                   Jeanin, Laboratorie de Chimie des Metaux de Transition, University              of Pierre and Marie Curie   Paris, France.  The objective of the                project is the investigation of coordination compounds of                       polyoxomolybdate anions.                                                                                                                                        Since heterogeneous metal oxide surfaces play an increasingly                   important role in the chemical industry, the chemical processes                 which occur on these surfaces are of considerable interest.  The                chemistry of polyoxomolybdates with organonitrogen species is of                particular importance in providing chemical models for abiological              nitrogen fixation and industrial ammoxidation.  In this joint                   project, the investigators will exploit currently developed                     synthetic methodologies for organohydrazido complexes of polyoxo-               molybdates to the coordination chemistry of polymetalates with                  organoimido ligands.  The experimental plan will concentrate on the             synthesis of organoimido derivatives of organic soluble polyoxomo-              lybdates, of polyoxomolybdate complexes stabilized by coligands,                and of lacunary polyoxometalates.  The complexes will be character-             ized using X-ray crystallography, multinuclear NMR and electro-                 chemistry.  Thermal and photochemical decomposition reactions of                the organoimido derivatives, as well as their reactions with                    allyalcohol and alkenes will be investigated.  The project will                 benefit from the complementary expertise of the US and French                   investigators; the two laboratories have been studying related                  aspects of the coordination chemistry of polyoxometalates with                  organonitrogen ligands for several years.",
