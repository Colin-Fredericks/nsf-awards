Nicolais               of the University of Naples.  The investigators plan to continue                previously supported work in the area of advanced polymer                       composites.  More specifically, over the next three years they                  intend to work on: (1) Processing of thermosetting resin composites;            (2) processing of thermoplastic resin composites; (3) master                    model property inputs; and (4) vapor and liquid permeabilities of               carbon and glass fiber beds.                                                                                                                                    The researchers are experienced collaborators; their recently                   completed effort on thermosetting processing research, in which                 many of the processing models were developed in the U.S. with much              of the basic data needed as input to the models obtained from                   Italy, is an example of the complementarity intrinsic to much of                their work.  The proposed projects are on                                       the forefront of emerging technology that is critically important               to the strategic materials base as well as the economies of both                countries.",
