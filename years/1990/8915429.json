 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic                              Mountains has the most complete Gondwana sequence (Victoria                     Group of the Beacon Supergroup) in Antarctica.  This                            sequence is overlain by tholeiitic flood basalts of the                         Ferrar Group which are related to Gondwana fragmentation.                       The volcanism and flood basalt eruption reflect a major                         change in tectonic environment in the Transantarctic                            Mountains, from a foreland basin associated with an active                      plate margin to a continental rift related to Gondwana                          breakup.  The objectives of this project are to:                                1) establish a detailed stratigraphic framework for the                         volcanogenic rocks in order to assess the importance of                         regional thinning of units and of syndepositional                               extensional normal faulting; 2) investigate the                                 paleovolcanology of this sequence, in particular that part                      of it formed by phreatomagmatic processes, in order to                          understand the physical environment in which the rocks were                     formed and the relations to the inferred tectonic setting;                      3) further characterize the geochemistry of the                                 volcanogenic rocks in order to better define time dependent                     changes in magma compositions and possible relations                            between the silicic and basaltic rocks; 4) attempt a                            preliminary assessment of possible source regions for the                       silicic magmas.",
