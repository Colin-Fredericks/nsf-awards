 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between                          Dr. John L. Omdahl of the University of New Mexico and                          Dr. Brian May at the University of Adelaide (South Australia).                  The research is clearly significant in the development of our                   understanding of the ubiquitous biological activities of the                    many varieties of P450 genes. For example, some P450 genes are                  expressed in the liver to metabolize foreign chemicals such                     as drugs and others are expressed in tissues for hormone                        production.  Specifically, these researchers propose to                         define the control region of the P450 gene responsible for                      metabolism of phenobarbital in chickens, and to isolate                         the P450 gene of the pig to lay the ground for future work in                   defining the control regions of these genes responsive to                       hormones.                                                                                                                                                       The project brings together complementary expertise in that                     Dr. May is well-versed in the molecular biology of these                        systems, and Dr. Omdahl is an expert in their biology.  In                      addition to the scientific advances anticipated and their                       potential applications to toxicology, the University of                         Adelaide's Center of Excellence for Gene Technology will                        serve as a resource for  understanding how such centers are                     organized and administered for potential application at the                     University of New Mexico.",
