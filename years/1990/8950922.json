 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the the Department of Agricultural                 Engineering at Oklahoma State University to develop a microcomputer             based, data acquisition and control laboratory for use by various               introductory classes in the life sciences and engineering.  The                 project has four objectives; to provide students insight to                     scientific uses of computers, to expose them to state-of-the-art                automatic data entry and instrument control, to improve the quality             of student laboratory data and minimize tedious number crunching,               and finally to create exciting broad audience, lower division                   experiments.  This last objective will refresh the interests of                 technical majors and possibly even attract to the life sciences                 and engineering, students from other fields.                                                                                                                    The equipment used will include data acquisition and control units,             power supplies and custom experimental apparatus.  Multiple units               will ensure every student obtains hands on experience.  This                    equipment will allow many different types of experiments to be                  performed, including measurements of biological response, thermal               dynamics and control, thermal processign, and robotics.  This                   project will significantly increase the level of instruction in the             intended classes above current levels at this or any other known                institution.  The developments here, should serve as a model for                improvement at other schools.  This award is being matched by the               grantee with with non-Federal sources.",
