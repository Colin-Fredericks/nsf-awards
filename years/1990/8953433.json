 "awd_abstract_narration": "The St. Louis Science Center, originating in the Academy                   of Science of St. Louis, founded in 1856, is today a major                      American science center attracting more than 670,000 visitors                   each year.  A 34 million dollar facility expansion will open                    in late 1991.  As part of that expansion, the science center                    will develop two unique sets of interactive science                             exhibitions that will encourage visitor interaction with                        concepts and ideas through \"multiple-outcome participatory                      exhibits.\"  These experimental exhibitions will be developed                    in two clusters totalling 2,000 to 3,000 square feet of                         exhibits that will be integral parts of larger, themed                          galleries.                                                                                                                                                           In the first cluster visitors will explore                                 misconceptions and personal assumptions about science, using                    exhibit modules that address popular myths about science.                       Exhibits will demonstrate experimental phenomena contrary to                    naive views and allow visitors to replace existing ideas with                   more general and more powerful scientific principles.                           Approximately 15 exhibits on misconceptions in newtonian                        mechanics and classical optics as well as other areas will be                   developed.                                                                                                                                                           The second of the two clusters will allow free, open                       exploration by visitors of a variety of scientific phenomena                    and principles of explanation.  Visitors will measure as well                   as observe, using modern laboratory instrumentation that can                    be successfully operated by visitors with minimal                               supervision.  The topics of light, motion, sound, energy, and                   physiology will be covered with six lab stations in each.                                                                                                            These experimental exhibit units will be developed with                    the assistance of outside advisors and consultants, will                        involve prototyping and formative evaluation of visitor                         response to trial units, and will include formal evaluation                     at the conclusion of the project.  A unique cooperative                         agreement with the Science Museum of Minnesota will allow                       exchange of audience research data, staff exchanges, and                        frequent consultation between the two groups.                                                                                                                        This project will explore new modes of exhibit based                       learning and the potential in exhibit research partnerships.                    Cost sharing equal to the award will be provided by the St.                     Louis Science Center.  The resulting exhibits will be seen by                   more than a million visitors each year in the new science                       center facilities.",
