 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program outlined continues successful earlier NSF                           supported research in transport process in two phase flow.                      The general objectives are to understand how turbulent                          transport of molecular species is related to Lagrangian                         statistics, to understand the turbulent transport of                            particles, droplets and bubbles that have a density different                   from the fluid in which they are suspended, to understand how                   the turbulent transport of mass at a solid/liquid or a                          gas/liquid boundary is related to fluid mechanical factors                      close to the interface, and to understand non-linear waves                      caused by air flow over a liquid surface.                                                                                                                       Five projects are proposed:  (1) Computer studies that relate                   the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions of turbulent                           transport, and that provide information on the role of                          molecular diffusivity in diminishing turbulent transport; (2)                   Optical studies on the turbulent transport of drops, particles                                                                                                  and bubbles; (3) Influence of waves on gas absorption in                        stratified flows; (4) Finite amplitude waves in gas-liquid                      stratified flows; (5) Turbulent mass transfer at a solid-                       liquid boundary.                                                                                                                                                Important aspects of this work are that combined laboratory                     and supercomputer experiments will be conducted and that newly                                                                                                  developed optical techniques will be used to study Lagrangian                   turbulence characteristics of particles, drops and bubbles and                                                                                                  finally, one of the most immediate consequences to be derived                   from this study will be the application leading to development                                                                                                  of improved design equations for gas/liquid flow in pipelines.                                                                                                  The system chosen to study gas absorption is of practical                       importance in many process problems.  However, it is also of                    interest to geophysicists, since the transfer across the                        surface of environmental waters is an important phase of the                    geophysical and natural biochemical cycles of numerous                          substances.  This explains the widespread interest in it by                     chemists, geophysicists, civil engineers, mechanical                            engineers, and environmentalists.",
