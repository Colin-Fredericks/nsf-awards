This research project utilizes heavy atom isotope effect                        studies in determining mechanistic details for a variety of                     addition and elimination reactions.  Specific reaction systems                  on which carbon-14 isotope effect measurements and calculations                 are being made are the Hofmann and Cope Elimination reactions,                  the solvolysis of substituted alpha-phenylethyl compounds, the                  decomposition of brominated cinnamic acids, the addition of                     arenesulfenyl chlorides to phenylethenes, and the addition of                   dibromine to 1,2-diphenylethenes, cinnamic acid esters, and                     phenylethynes.  Correlation of experimentally measured and                      theoretically calculated isotope effects will be used to                        determine details of transition state structure, motion through                 the transition state, and the timing of bonding changes in                      chemical reactions.",
