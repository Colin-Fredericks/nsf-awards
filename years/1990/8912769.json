 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a long-term research visit to           Denmark by Dr. James T. Morris of the University of South Carolina.             He will collaborate with Dr. Arne Jensen and others of the Botanical            Institute of the University of Aarhus in a comparative study of salt            marsh carbon cycles.  Dr. Morris has studied carbon dioxide exchange,           decomposition and nutrient uptake in marshes for many years, and has            produced several physiologically based models of these processes.               With Dr. Jensen, he will adapt these models to Skallingen salt marsh            in Denmark, and use the models to explore differences in the carbon             cycles of climatically dissimilar marshes from Northern Europe and the          Southeastern United States.  They also plan to combine these models             into an integrated ecosystem level model that will be used to                   predict the dynamics of salt marsh carbon cycles, including below-              ground production.  The collaborative plan provides Dr. Morris with             access to a vastly different marsh environment, an excellent group of           plant ecologists, led by Dr. Jensen, and a world renowned group of              estuarine biogeochemists.  He expects to learn remote sensing skills            and new methods in plant physiology, as well as benefit from the                different concepts and approaches to ecology in Europe.  In return,             the Danish group should benefit from Dr. Morris'expertise in numerical          modelling.                                                                                                                                                      Salt marshes are highly productive ecosystems that exist worldwide              along continental margins in the temperate zone.  Primary production            in these ecosystems is thought to be an important source of nutrition           for commercially important fishes.  Salt marshes also function as               sinks for organic carbon; however, knowledge of the carbon cycle in             salt marshes is incomplete.  The rate of below-ground primary                   production has been especially difficult to measure and is subject to           great uncertainty due to sampling error.  The proposed collaboration            is expected to result in a theoretically robust model that will be              useful for predicting or evaluating primary production and other                carbon cycle processes in salt marshes.  The structure of the model             is general and could be applied to other systems when calibrated.",
