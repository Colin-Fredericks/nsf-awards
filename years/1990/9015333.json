 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to study the feasibility of                   applying neural networks to the real-time discrimination between                true defects and surface anomalies in float glass ribbon. At the                present time the industry uses a laser scanner system capable of                detecting defects in newly manufactured glass ribbon.  The system               does not distinguish between true defects and harmless surface                  anomalies which causes marketable glass to be wasted.                                   Data collection will be performed in a laboratory setting               using a laser scanner system identical to those currently working               in the factory.  The laboratory setup will be designed to simulate              the conditions as closely as possible, so that any result from this             study should be applicable to factory production.  Because a large              number of defect samples are available, the evaluation will focus               on neural networks which learn in a supervised mode.  At least two              such techniques will be utilized:  (1)  backpropagation network                 with the generalized delta rule used as a learning algorithm; and               (2)  a technique which involves the use of the delta rule in a                  novel way.",
