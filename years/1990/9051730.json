 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the physical-analytical sequence at Georgia State University,                improvements are being made in studies on solution phenomena and                thermodynamic analyses, and high pressure liquid chromatography                 (HPLC) is now the primary technique in the chromatography area.                 Automated thermal and pH titration systems connected to personal                computers are being used by students to explore, in a biological                context, the thermodynamic and analytical aspects of proton                     transfer and metal ion binding.  Titrations with hundreds or even               thousands of data points can be performed on small volumes, thus                allowing use of costly biological samples and performance of up                 to ten times more experiments than at present.  Students are                    using HPLC to perform separations of optically active components,               establish the molecular weight distribution for sonicated DNA                   samples and amylose mixtures, explore the analytical capabilities               of chromatography and determine the detection limits for a                      particular component in an analgesic.  Extensive data for several               biological systems will be combined with the latest mathematical                treatments to provide physical parameters and their associated                  errors for each system studied, and in some cases test the                      validity of chemical models.                                                                                                                                    The institution is contributing to this project and amount equal                to the NSF funds.",
