Pilot research                 indicates that learners achieve native-like command of the                      morphosyntax of the tense and aspect system before they acquire                 native-like semantics.  This study will document the differential               development of morphosyntax and semantics by long-term                          observation of learners.  Natural and experimental language                     samples will be collected from twenty learners of English over a                period of one year as they move from beginning to advanced levels               of proficiency.  These samples will be analyzed with respect to                 English to determine how target-like the interlanguage system is,               on the one hand, and independently, to understand the internal                  characteristics of the developing system, on the other.  In                     addition, the emerging semantics will be compared across learners               to ascertain the extent of target and native language influence                 and the universality of the developing systems.  Besides                        describing one facet of language acquisition, the results of this               study will contribute important new information about the nature                of interlanguage semantics and provide evidence about the ability               of the adult mind to acquire language.",
