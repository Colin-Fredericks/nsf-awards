 "awd_abstract_narration": "The self-concept is the outcome of a number of forces, including                no doubt, the culture within which the concept develops.  If                    cultures differ, then the self-concepts of inhabitants of the                   cultures should differ too. If this is so, then the system of                   rewards, of interdependencies, of fitting-in, achieving, etc.,                  should differ as well.  This research, focused on American and                  Japanese respondents, is an attempt to test these possibilities.                The goal of the 12 studies of the project is to lay the                         groundwork for understanding differences in the ways in which the               fundamental reward systems work cross-culturally.  The                          implications of this research for understanding important                       cultural differences, and for understanding ways in which                       cultures might be brought into more effective communication, are                vast.  The research team on the project is first-rate, and there                is little doubt that this project will provide results of immense               importance, both in terms of fundamental social psychological                   theory and application.",
