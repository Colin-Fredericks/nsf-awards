The method being developed in this                       project combines simulation models of solute transport and                                                                                                      fate, descriptions of spatial variability, probabilistic                        analysis of uncertainty, and optimization.  The proposed                        algorithm is expected to be used to simultaneously                              estimate the aquifer parameters in making decisions on the                                                                                                      location of wells and rate of pumping.  Subject to                              constraints on decision variables and on reliability of                         meeting water quality standards, this method gives promise                                                                                                      for optimizing the objective function while balancing the                       effects of model and parameter uncertainties.  A newly                          developed estimation method will be incorporated in the                         optimization algorithm to improve the performance of                            estimation.                                                                                                                                                     Results of this project are expected to provide an                              approach for determination of the effects that aquifer                          remediation procedures will have on quality of water in                         the aquifer.  This will include the identification of                           additional information that is needed before engineering                        design of the remediation procedure which may involve both                                                                                                      injection and recharge systems supplemented by above-                           ground or in situ chemical or biological treatment                              procedures.",
