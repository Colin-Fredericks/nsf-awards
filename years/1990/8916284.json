 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the proposed investigation is two-fold:  1) to                   study the regulation of magnesium ions in excitable cells by                    measuring the fluxes of stable isotopes in and out of these                     cells, and in the process, 2) to develop and perfect a general                  technique for measuring fluxes and flux parameters by the use of                stable isotopes as tracers.  The technique of mass spectrometry                 will allow calculation of the fluxes through determination of the               shifts in the ratios of the different stable isotopes of                        magnesium to each other.  At present there is a great lack of                   quantitative information on magnesium ion fluxes in excitable and               other cells, particularly concerning how magnesium movements are                coupled to energy sources.  Part of the reason for the deficiency               in information stems from the difficulty previous workers have                  had in obtaining the only radioactive tracer of magnesium,                      namely, the short-lived isotope 28Mg; thus, the use of isotopes                 that do not decay will permit continuous and uninterrupted                      research.  Another major advantage of using this approach is that               bidirectional fluxes of two or more ionic species can be                        simultaneously measured in the same experiment.  Successful                     completion of all aspects of this project will make available                   badly needed new knowledge of the direct and indirect energy                    sources affecting magnesium movements, the calculation of the                   stoichiometries of any magnesium counter-exchange involved, the                 definition of the possible role of the membrane potential in                    magnesium counter-ion transport, and an understanding of how                    these factors may work in concert to maintain physiological                     levels of intracellular magnesium ion.  This proposed study                     should serve as a model for flux studies of other ions as well.                                                                                                 One of the important mechanisms by which cells receive signals                  and transduce external signals to intracellular biochemical                     messages involves the movement of ions across the cell's external               membrane or from one compartment to another within the cell.                    Studies of these processes often require the measurement of ion                 fluxes, and ion fluxes are usually measured by the use of                       radioactive isotopes as tracers.  This research will develop and                apply an alternative approach to the measurement of transmembrane               cation fluxes.  This method employs stable isotopes as tracers                  and uses mass spectrometry to measure shifts in isotope ratios of               a given element in a sample from a cell or the cell's external                  medium.  These measurements, when coupled with measurements of                  the concentration of that element in a sample (e.g. by atomic                   absorption spectroscopy) make it possible to determine fluxes in                and out of cells.  The technique will be applied to the study of                magnesium fluxes.  Considerable evidence suggests that magnesium                movements may play important physiological roles, but radio-                    active isotopes of magnesium are very difficult to work with and                very expensive, so few measurements have been made of magnesium                 fluxes.  This research will provide a new method for studying ion               fluxes without radioactive isotopes, and new information on the                 physiological movements of magnesium in cells.***//",
