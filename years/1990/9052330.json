 "awd_abstract_narration": "The curriculum of the Chemistry Department has been strengthened                by the acquisition of an atomic absorption spectrometer in the                  following ways:  (1) students from several academic disciplines                 gain first-had knowledge of an important analytical technique; (2)              a critical assessment of the data obtained is made part of the                  experiment; (3) new experiments have been implemented which not                 only illustrate scientific principles but also relate to current                problems of the environment; and (4) experiments previously in use              are done more efficiently.  The instrumentation is used by students             in their second semester of freshmen chemistry as well as Physical              and Inorganic Chemistry, Instrumental Methods of Analysis, and                  Undergraduate Research.                                                                                                                                         The institution contributed to this project in an amount equal to               the NSF funds.",
