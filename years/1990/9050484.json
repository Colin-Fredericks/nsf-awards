 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of computer for controlling instruments and in the                      collecting and analyzing of data is an integral part of the                     chemistry curriculum today and should pervade all levels of a                   student's experience.  The Chemistry Department at Converse                     College has used the HRM (Human Relations Media) Software:                      Experiments in Chemistry successfully for the last five year in                 the upper level Physical Chemistry Laboratory and Instrumental                  Analysis.  The HRM software allow students to collect real-time                 data using a thermistor probe or electrode, enter it directly                   into the computer and graphically analyze that data.  Because of                its success in these laboratories and because the department is                 committed to the continuing improvement of its curriculum they                  obtained nine Apple IIe/HRM computer software set-ups to be used                in General Chemistry and Quantitative Analysis for the collection               and analysis of data.  This has extended the use of computer                    assisted labs into the elementary curriculum where is it used by                science and non-science majors alike.                                                                                                                           The institution has contributed to this project in an amount                    equal to the NSF funds.",
