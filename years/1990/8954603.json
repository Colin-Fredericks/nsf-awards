The goals include                          increasing teachers' knowledge of basic mathematics, increasing                 their ability to teach this material to their students,                         obtaining the informed support of the supervisors of                            participating teachers, and creating a professional learning                    community and support network for teachers of mathematics at                    all grade levels.  Participants will attend either a sixteen-                   day summer institute in mathematics content and related                         methodology or similar academic-year courses.  Extensive in-                    school support will also be provided, and during the second                     summer, fifteen teachers will attend a twelve-day advanced                      institute.  Responsibility for instruction will be shared by                    university faculty and school personnel.  A total of 105                        teachers from a region centered on District 10 in the Bronx                     will participate in the project.                                                                                                                                Lehman College of the City University of New York and the New                   York City Board of Education are contributing as cost-sharing                   an amount equal to 67% of the NSF award.",
