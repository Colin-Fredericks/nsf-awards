 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological recycling of phosphorus (P) in surficial organic                horizons has been suggested as an important mechanism maintaining               soil P availability in some tropical forests.  A similar                        mechanism has been proposed for some temperate forests, but no                  direct evidence has been gathered with respect to this surmise.                 More recent studies suggest that high densities of microorganisms               in tropical forest floors may actually inhibit plant uptake, and                that P might be particularly susceptible to leaching in organic                 form.                                                                                Preliminary investigations at the Coweeta Hydrologic                       Laboratory in North Carolina have shown strong geochemical P                    adsorption in all mineral soil horizons and the importance of                   microbial immobilization in the forest floor, suggesting that                   forest floor organic matter also inhibits geochemical adsorption.               Collectively, these data strongly suggest that tight biological                 control of P cycling in the forest may contribute significantly                 in maintaining long-term P availability in these southern                       Appalachian forests.                                                                 Research sponsored by a two-year postdoctoral fellowship                   award will allow tests of the \"biological control\" hypothesis by                means of a series of laboratory and field radiotracer                           experiments.  Specific objectives are to determine the relative                 importance of microbial immobilization, plant/mycorrhizal uptake,               and mineral adsorption in controlling P dynamics in forest floor                and mineral horizons of a temperate deciduous forest soil, and to               examine vertical movement of organic and inorganic P.  The                      Fellow's host institution for the study is Duke University.",
