 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of invasive plant species has often emphasized                attempts to make generalizations about the life history                         characteristics of invaders and descriptions of their genetic                   variability.  In these attempts, species native to widely                       divergent climates and habitats are often compared.  The results                are often a comparison of species that only have their invasive                 ability in common.  Comparative study of a native species growing               with an invasive congener has been repeatedly suggested as a                    means of gaining a clearer understanding of the attributes that                 actually do enable a species to become invasive.  This type of                  comparative study could also contribute to an understanding of                  the changes plant invaders may affect in the communities in                     which they occur.                                                                       This study will perform such a comparison.  The focus of the            study will be \u001aLonicero\u001a \u001ajaponica\u001a native to Asia, and \u001aLonicera\u001a              \u001asempervirens\u001a native to the southeastern United States. This                   investigation will be conducted in the southeastern United                      States where \u001aL\u001a. \u001ajaponica\u001a has been an invasive species since the             early 19th century.                                                                     This study will include a comparative  examination of seed              emergence, seedling survival, growth rates, temporal variation                  in light utilization, and any effects preferential herbivory may                have on growth and establishment between the two species.  The                  potential effects of pollinator competition on population biology               will be examined through observations of pollination within and                 among populations of these two congeners.  Changes in plant                     community structure will be measured by sampling community                      composition in a series of successive old fields.  The proposed                 project will contribute to an improved understanding of the                     possible advantages invading species have as compared to native                 species, the effects their presence may have on succession and                  plant community structure.",
