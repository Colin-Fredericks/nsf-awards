 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transcriptional enhancers are a crucial element in eukaryotic                   gene expression, yet their mechanism of action is largely                       unknown.  The Xenopus rRNA enhancer is an excellent system in                   which to probe enhancer mechanism because it can be easily                      assayed by injection into oocytes and appears to require only                   a small number of proteins for its activity.  When the rRNA                     enhancer and promoter are located in trans on the opposite                      rings of a multiply-intertwined dimeric catenane, the enhancer                  augments transcription.  This result strongly suggests that                     enhancers work by looping, and this approach can be used to                     further test enhancer mechanism and to better understand                        transcription mechanisms.  To test the importance of catenane                   structure in trans activation, gyrase network of the promoter                   and enhancer, which consist of single interlinks in essentially                 all combinations, will be prepared and assayed for enhancer                     activity.  The importance of enhancer topology will be tested                   by linearizing the enhancer after transcriptional activation.                   The kinetics of transcription complex formation will be                         examined by oocyte injection.  Oligonucleotide-directed triple                  helix formation will be tested for its usefulness as a tool in                  dissecting transcriptional mechanisms.  The mechanisms of                       enhancer action and transcription  of RNA polymerase II genes                   in Xenopus oocytes and embryos will be investigated by defining                 the regulatory sequences of oocyte-specific genes and testing                   trans activation of an embryonic enhancer. In a complementary                   approach, the interaction of the transcription factor THIS with                 both the promoter and enhancer will be characterized in more                    detail.  The DNasel footprint of THIS suggests that the DNA                     wraps around the protein.  This hypothesis will be tested by                    determining whether a change in the linking number of a plasmid                 containing  THIS binding site in the circular permutation                       assay.  Enhancer mutants that have changes either in spacing                    between sites or promoter THIS binding sites substitution for                   enhancer sites will be assayed for transcription.  The                          importance of primary sequences and DNA structure in THIS                       binding and bending will be explored by combining DMS                           protection and interference, ethylation interference and                        bending studies with site directed mutagenesis of the THIS                      binding sites.  the polypeptides copurifying with THIS activity                 will be characterized in more detail.",
