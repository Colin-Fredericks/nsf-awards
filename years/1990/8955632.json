 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loyola University of Chicago will initiate a 6-week commuter                    Young Scholars project for l8 students in grades ll-l2 in                       math/computer science.  This project gives participants a                       comprehensive introduction to computer science from both                        hardware and software perspectives.  Students experiment in                     two distinct forums.  First, they assemble IBM-compatible                       microcomputers, and then perform digital circuitry                              experiments on the computers and other electronics equipment.                   Second, they experiment on mathematical objects through                         programs they write in the project's software science                           introduction.  Also, during the summer, participants visit                      software development firms and R&D facilities at Motorola,                      Inc. and AT&T Bell Labs.  At the end of the full-time summer                    activity, students take their computers home to keep and use                    throughout an intensive and sustained eight-month academic                      year follow-up.  The project began in l988 under YSP funding.                   It has been widely recognized by Chicago's news media and by                    its municipal government.  Beginning in l990, the project                       will adopt an artificial intelligence component and                             accompanying group programming project; the career                              exploration and philosophy/ethics components will be                            deepened; and, the project will become formally affiliated                      with an NSF-funded prototype Comprehensive Regional Center                      for Minorities.",
