 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for support of the research in arithmetic                    algebraic geometry of Dr. Noam Elkies of Harvard University. Dr.                Elkies proposes to continue his studies of the arithmetic of                    supersingular curves over function fields with finite constant                  field; by looking closely at these, he has already discovered                   sphere packings in certain high-dimensional Euclidean spaces that               are more dense than any previously known. In addition, Dr. Elkies               plans to investigate explicit modular equations from a                          computational viewpoint and connect these with the abstract                     theory of heights.                                                                   This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
