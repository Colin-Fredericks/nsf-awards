 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-week workshop in Computational Physics is helping 20 faculty              members from predominantly undergraduate departments throughout the             United States become conversant with two important, rapidly developing          areas of computational physics.  These are the use of symbolic                  manipulation programs such as  Maple and Mathematica in the solution of         physics problems, and the use of computer simulation methods to better          understand physical problems.  Participants in the workshop are                 expected to develop one or more applications of these methods for use           in advanced undergraduate courses during the semester or the term               following the workshop.  In 1991, the participants will return to the           university for a two-day follow-up session.  They will then share the           applications that they have made with the entire group.  Project staff          are available both by telephone and computer network in the interim             between the workshop and the follow-up session to assist the                    participants in the development of their applications.",
