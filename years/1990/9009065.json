The grant will provide funds                 for her to visit established research centers and consult with                  experts in the field.  In addition she will attend several                      conferences and participate in research seminars.                                    The project itself deals with C* algebras.  The notion of a                C* algebra is an abstraction of the idea of a family of linear                  transformations on a space.  These transformations can also be                  thought of as having values in the states of the space, and the                 property of this family which is responsible for the symbol * is                that the algebra is generated by transformations whose values in                these states are real numbers.  The fact that these objects                     appear naturally in many branches of mathematics and physics make               them important to study.",
