 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four major problems have dominated recent discussions of U.S.                   economic growth: the productivity slowdown that began in 1973,                  the dramatic differences in growth across regions throughout the                postwar era, the relationship between productivity and U.S.                     international competitiveness, and the impact of the                            deterioration of the public infrastructure on the nation's                      economic performance. The analysis of regional productivity                     growth  from this project could potentially offer important                     insights into all of these issues.                                                                                                                              In this project, the growth rate and level of productivity in                   twenty one industries for each of nine regions over the 1951-1986               period will be estimated. This approach parallels the trend in                  national productivity research toward disaggregation. Although                  this disaggregation has focused on narrower industry detail, it                 is likely that focusing on regional growth will lead to further                 gains. The results of the project will allow several important                  questions to be answered:                                                            (1) Has productivity grown more rapidly in some regions than               others?                                                                              (2) Was the productivity slowdown limited to a small number                of regions, or was it more pervasive?                                                (3) Is there any evidence that regional productivity levels                are converging?                                                                      (4) Are regional differences in productivity correlated with               industrial characteristics, the degree of urbanization, education               expenditures, regional investment in public infrastructure                      capital, and other public policies?",
