 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of trace surface analysis.  The thrust of this activity                is the construction and testing of an imaging neutron activation                analysis detector capable of discerning element concentrations on               a point by point basis.  Neutron activation analysis is an                      extremely powerful method for measuring major, minor, and trace                 element concentrations in a wide variety of samples.  In this                   method, analyte elements absorb a neutron to form a radionuclide                which usually decays by emitting a B particle and a gamma ray.                  The gamma ray energies are characteristic of the analyte element                and they are normally measured with a germanium detector.                       Secondary electrons produced at a sample surface as a B-particle                passes out of a thin sample can be accelerated and imaged.  When                gamma rays and B-particles are detected in coincidence, the gamma               ray energy answers the question \"what\" and the secondary electron               position answers the question  \"where\" for an individual                        radionuclide disintegration.  This information will be organized                into element maps and local area gamma ray spectra.                                                                                                             Successful pursuit of this research should facilitate the                       application of imaging neutron activation analysis to the                       characterization of heterogeneous solids.  Following a coupled                  successful Phase II effort, widespread applications in fields such              as geology, biology, materials science, and particle analysis can               be anticipated.",
