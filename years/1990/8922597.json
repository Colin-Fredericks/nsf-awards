 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past ten years interest and advances in the molecular                    biology of streptococci have increased dramatically.  Although                  this broad group of bacteria can have vastly different ecological               niches and socio-economic implications, they share unique                       mechanisms of genetic exchange and modes of gene regulation, and                present common technical difficulties to investigators.  Based                  on the past two conferences and a recent poll more than 150                     scientists are expected to attend the Third International                       Streptococcal Genetic Conference to be held in Minneapolis, June                6-9, 1990.  The conference will be arranged and administered by                 the American Society for Microbiology.  Its goal is to                          disseminate the most recent discoveries which impact on the                     molecular genetics of streptococci important to agriculture, food               science and human disease.  Speakers will represent those who do                the highest quality, most significant work in these fields.                     Moreover, poster sessions are planned to give others the                        opportunity to present more preliminary studies.  Plans are to                  publish the proceedings through the ASM Publications Office.                    Goals of the organizing committee are to create an atmosphere                   conducive to the development of future collaboration and                        interaction among the participants, and to expose young                         scientists, students and postdoctoral trainees to the exciting                  scientific questions and future of this field.",
