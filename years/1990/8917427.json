 "awd_abstract_narration": "Denitrification is a key process in the nitrogen cycle, which                   controls the amount of nitrogen available for plant growth.  It                 is estimated that up to 30% of fertilizer nitrogen is lost via                  denitrification.  The pathway by which nitrate is reduced to                    gaseous nitrogen is still not known in detail, but nitrite and                  nitrous oxide have been identified as free intermediates, and                   there appear to be two routes from NO2 - to N2O, one direct and                 the other via NO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The object of the proposed research is to elucidate the                         pathway(s) by which NO2 - is converted to N2O.  The major                       questions to be answered are how NO2 - is reduced by the heme cd1               and copper-containing nitrite reductases, how NO is reduced to                  N2O by nitric oxide reductase, and what  factors control the                    relative flux via the two routes from NO2 - to N2O in vivo.  A                  multifaceted approach to the problem is described, combining                    chemical and biological studies, and focussing on the mechanism                 by which the N-N bond of N2O is formed.  Specific techniques to                 be employed include isotopic labelling experiments; kinetics                    studies; cryoenzymological and spectroscopic studies of the                     purified enzymes; and electron  microscopy. Specific systems to                 be examined include whole cells and cell-free extracts of                       selected wild-type denitrifying bacteria and appropriate mutants,               as well as purified nitrite reductase and crude nitric oxide                    reductase preparations.",
