Among the several projects currently underway and being                         proposed for the future, two specific areas are being                           currently emphasized.  These areas are:  a) optical                             communications and b) optical methods in material                               evaluation.  New and exciting methods for communications,                       ultrastable solid state lasers and infrared imaging are                         currently being explored for which the proposed optical                         systems can greatly enhance the opportunities for success.                      A new ultra-high noise rejection high efficiency quantum                        filter, which holds the record for the narrowest bandwidth                      wide field-of-view operation, is under development in the                       OMS Lab.  The device is well suited to optical                                  communication applications where a weak narrow-bandwidth                        signals are buried in strong non-resonant noise.  Pulsed                        optical systems of high quality and the associated                              equipment will be put to good use in the further                                development of the filter.  Fast and accurate testing of                        materials and material processing is also an area being                         studied in detail.  The OMS Lab is studying new techniques                      for the analysis of materials and the complex structures                        which embody the materials.  Infrared and laser                                 optical systems will be used to study the failure of                            airframe structures and highway bridges.  Each of these                         areas are critical to several industries in the                                 U.S.  Further development and transfer of technology in                         these areas to industry will help to strengthen the                             industrial base in the U.S.",
