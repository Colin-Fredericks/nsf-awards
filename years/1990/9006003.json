 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this investigation is to explore the mechanisms whereby          parasites achieve successful development in their host.  The question           is often asked:  \"Who is in control of this relationship - the                  parasites or their host?\"  In Dr. Beckage experiments, larvae of the            tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, are used as a model of parasitic               infection in conjunction with the wasp parasitoid Cotesia congregata.           The wasp injects a virus into host larvae along with its eggs, and the          role of the virus in facilitating successful parasitism will be                 examined.  The virus induces a new protein to be synthesized by the             host, and the role of the protein in suppressing the immune response            of the host will be tested using hemocyte assays in the presence and            the absence of the protein to assess whether it inhibits encapsulation          of foreign organisms by the host's blood cells.  Another goal will be           to identify the gene encoding the amino acid sequence of the protein            and study its regulation in newly parasitized larvae.  A variety of             parasites have viruses associated with them, including protozoa and             amoebae, yet their role has yet to be identified in most cases.  The            viruses may be developed as mechanisms of genetic transformation of             arthropods and parasites, thus paving the way of novel genetic studies          and manipulation of pest species and medically important parasites.",
