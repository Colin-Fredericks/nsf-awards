 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is to determine what                      undergraduate school characteristics and student background factors             are associated with persistence in mathematics, natural sciences, and           engineering, particularly for women and minority students.  The data            set is based on a longitudinal sample of 69,000 students who had SAT            scores, GRE scores, and accompanying questionnarie responses.  These            data include major field of study at three points in time: intended             major at high school graduation, actual undergraduate major, and                intended graduate major.  The prediction of persistence in these                fields will be analyzed with multinomial logit or logistic regression           models.                                                                           Interactive activities include a course entitled Psychological                Measurement in Survey Research, guest lectures on recent works, a talk          to students about ETS research and choice of science careers,                   statistical advising to faculty and students, and participation in              social activities with Hispanic and other minority faculty and                  students.                                                                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
