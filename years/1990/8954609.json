 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to strengthen the background and preparation of        high school chemistry teachers from rural Midwestern United States.             Twenty-five secondary school teachers from this region who are assigned         to teach chemistry but who have less than a minor of formal preparation         in chemistry, will be selected as Phase I participants.  These teachers         will spend four weeks during the first summer (1990) in an intensively          scheduled laboratory and lecture workshop during which topics applicable                                                                                        to high school chemistry will be emphasized along with appropriate              laboratory and demonstration activities.  The participants will work            closely with mentor teachers, in a ratio of five participants/mentor,           who are considered to be the area's strong chemistry teachers as well as        with the project staff.  Two Friday/Saturday sessions are planned for           the academic year following the summer workshop.  Dr. Vernon Thielmann          of SMSU and the mentor teachers will conduct extensive follow-up visits         with  these teachers in their classrooms.                                                                                                                       During the second year of the project, Phase II will commence in which          at least fifteen of the Phase I teachers will continue their study of           chemistry and further enhance their strategies for teaching high school         chemistry.  This four-week summer will  include several theoretical             topics, more training in organic,                                               biochemistry, environmental chemistry and computer-aided                        instruction and simulation.  Additional teachers who have been                  identified as having at least a minor in chemistry will be                      selected in order to bring the number of Phase II teachers to                   twenty-five.                                                                                                                                                    This renewal project is the culmination of a previously                         successful effort to enhance the background and teaching                        strategies of high school chemistry teachers.  This project                     will have reached a large number of the secondary chemistry                     teachers in the rural areas of the Central Midwest states of                    Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma.                        Teachers in rural areas tend to be among the most isolated and                  the least interactive with their peers.  This project not only                  addresses the content and teaching strategies issues, but                       establishes a                                                                   network of colleagues, mentors and University staff. The small                  cost-sharing of about 3% of the grant request is indicative of                  the relatively poor financial status in the area, not the                       willingness to share expertise and facilities.",
