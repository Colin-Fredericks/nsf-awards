 "awd_abstract_narration": "Satellite surveying has surpassed traditional ground based                 surveying in both efficiency and accuracy in the past few years.                The most powerful of such surveying techniques uses the NAVSTAR                 Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, which were developed                by the Department of Defense.  Measurements of 3-dimensional                    baselines between GPS receivers separated by 10 kilometers or                   more are now being routinely performed with one centimeter                      accuracy.  Such measurements can be completed using portable                    equipment in a few hours or less.  The University NAVSTAR                       Consortium (UNAVCO) is now utilizing GPS for worldwide crustal                  deformation and earthquake studies.  UNAVCO serves the research                 community in two different roles.  The first is the development                 and testing of GPS terminals and techniques with the highest                    possible accuracy and efficiency.  The second is offering GPS                   equipment and assistance to the academic community for research                 in earth sciences, and also providing training, as well as                      concentrating its research efforts on the improvement of vertical               accuracy, precise surveying in a kinematic rather than a                        stationary mode, development of reliable and well documented                    baseline analysis software, interactive computing and graphics,                 data archiving, and application of GPS technology to the                        detection of \"global greenhouse\" effects.  This renewal award                   continues support of these activities.",
