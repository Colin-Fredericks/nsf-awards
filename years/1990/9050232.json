 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Museum of Science is initiating a unique approach to                   its permanent exhibits which concentrates on the process of                     learning science rather than on the facts to be learned.  The                   first stage, development of \"Seeing the Unseen\", one of six                     activity centers, is the focus of this proposal.  Guided by the                 American Association for the Advancement of Science's call for                  reforms in science teaching and by recent research on learning                  styles, the Museum will organize its exhibits around six                        \"activity centers\".  Each center introduces a basic skill, such                 as observation or experimentation, and prompts a visitor to use                 the new method in special surrounding exhibits.  The project is                 a breakthrough approach to science learning in the museum                       setting because it encourages visitors to discover for                          themselves characteristic scientific activities and habits of                   analysis.  Although the Museum will use many current exhibits                   in the layout of the new plan, many others will be created                      which engage visitors interactively in learning science.  The                   total cost of the project is estimated to be $18 million.",
