 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal goal of this project is to introduce and use modern,              computer-based design tools and methodologies in a broad range of               undergraduate digital systems design activities.  The intent is to              introduce such tools and methods early in the program so that students          can become well-versed in their use before applying them at the                 advanced level.  This approach will greatly enhance instruction in              digital systems design and will also introduce students to current              industry practice.                                                                                                                                              Funds are requested for the development of a computer-aided engineering         laboratory to support five courses dealing with the design and                  implementation of digital systems.  The laboratory will consist of a            network of six lab stations, each consisting of a logic analysis system         coupled to an engineering workstation and supported by computer-aided           engineering software.  A network server will accommodate file and               program sharing among the lab stations.                                                                                                                         The idea is to integrate the capabilities of the logic analysis system          with those of the engineering workstation to form a single support              environment.  A student will first develop and verify, via simulation,          a circuit design on the workstation.  A prototype will then be                  constructed.  The logic analysis system, driven by workstation software         and using the simulation results, will be used to test the prototype by         comparing the observed prototype behavior to the expected behavior              indicated by the circuit simulation.  Modification of the original              design and/or prototype can occur as desired.",
