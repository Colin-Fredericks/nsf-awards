 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of 3-manifolds could be described to the lay                     person as the study of all possible 3-dimensional universes                     which are locally \"like\" the space we live in.  This project will               continue research into a class of 3-manifolds called laminated                  manifolds.  It has the potential to influence the subject quite                 significantly, especially if two goals are achieved.  The first                 goal is to extend methods and theorems from the well-known class                of Haken manifolds to the larger class of laminated manifolds.                  The second goal is to show that, in some sense, \"most\" 3-                       manifolds are laminated.                                                             Another part of the project deals with surfaces or 2-                      manifolds.  Here the object is to study certain geometric                       structures on surfaces, the spaces of these structures                          (Teichmueller spaces), laminations to which the geometric                       structures degenerate, and spaces of these laminations.  The                    remainder of the project deals with codimension-1 laminations in                manifolds of arbitrary dimension, especially with those having                  transverse structures.",
