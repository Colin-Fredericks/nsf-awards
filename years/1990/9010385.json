 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for high-speed computation in many digital signal processing         (DSP) and scientific application and the availability of low cost, high         speed, high density VLSI technology have provided a new dimension in            implementing architectures, particularly the evolvement of algorithm-           based application-specific architectures.  Systolic array is one class          of such architectures that exploits the strength of VLSI and is                 particularly suitable for implementing many DSP algorithms which are            well-structured and locally recursive.  As demand in speed and                  application rises, many systolic arrays have become more complex in             terms of cell structure, interconnection topology, and data flow.               Complete, precise, and formal description of architectures has become           vital for unambiguous and complete communication among designers and            implementers, as well as for formal verification of design correctness.         The main objective of the research is to fully develop a solid formalism        and apply it to systolic array level specification and design                   verification: (1) The formalism must provide simple, and yet complete           and precise description (specification) of any systolic structure and           behavior; (2) the formalism and related techniques developed must               exploit unique attributes of systolic arrays ( synchrony, modularity,           regularity, spatial and temporal locality, pipelinability,                      repeatability, and parallel processing ability) to produce notations and        verification procedures that are simple, elegant, and efficient; (3) the        constructs and operators involved should preferably be able to be               unified with one useful lower level formalism for coherent multilevel           reasoning; (4) the techniques should be automated and developed into a          CAD tool eventually; (5) the formalism must be further expanded for             synthesis description and design debugging.  The proposed research will         be carried out through rigorous and comprehensive survey, theoretical           analysis, design, and implementation.",
