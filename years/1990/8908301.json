Mite ectoparasites are know from all groups of birds except                penguins, emus, cassowaries and todids.  About 1,800 species have               been named (an estimated 10% of the existing fauna).  These are                 assigned to 357 named and 58 new genera and arranged in 31                      families.  Access to information about these mites is very                      difficult as few revisions have been completed and a biblography                has never been published.                                                            The objectives of this grant are to provide means for the                  identification of groups above the species level, with an indepth               study of one family.  Included will be illustrations of                         representative species, know host-parasite associations, and a                  bibliography of approximately 700 entries.  The resulting                       publications will provide comprehensive baseline data on the mite               ectoparasites of birds and will open this field of research for                 present and future investigators on a worldwide basis.",
