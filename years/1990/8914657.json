 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Carlos               F. Quiros, University of California at Davis, and two French                    groups:  Dr. Michael Delseny, Lab de Physiologie Vegetale,                      University of Perpignan, and Dr. Anne Marie Chevre, National                    Institute for Agronomic Research (INRA), Rennes.  The objective of              the project is to develop a series of cytogenetic stocks and                    molecular probes as chromosome markers, and to use them to study                the evolution of the Brassica genomes.                                                                                                                          Specifically, the project involves mapping the chromosomes of the               diploid species Brassica nigra and B. oleracea.  This will be done              by using a series of chromosome addition lines for these species                already developed at Davis and at INRA, Rennes, and a series of                 molecular probes developed at Perpignan and Davis.  The Perpignan               group will develop additional informative DNA clones from B.                    nigra, and sequencing analysis, as well as provide expertise in                 other finer molecular genetics techniques.  The creation of                     additional lines will be the responsibility of INRA, Rennes, and                UCD.  At Rennes most of the addition lines in tetraploid background             will continue to be developed, while at Davis these lines will                  continue to be developed in diploid backgrounds.  UCD will do most              of the mapping activity on the basis of RFLP and isozyme markers                and the intergenomic recombination study.  This project brings                  together three of the world's top laboratories in Brassica                      research on a topic which is at the forefront of plant gene                     mapping research.  The results of this project will serve as the                basis for applied studies, such as the improvement of rapeseed and              cole crops, development of resistant varieties to Phoma, improved               oil quality and horticultural traits.",
