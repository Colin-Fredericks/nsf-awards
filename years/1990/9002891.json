 "awd_abstract_narration": "Graph traversal is a fundamental computational problem, not only                because it is the natural abstraction of many search problems, but              also because its complexity is at the root of important relationships           among deterministic, nondeterministic, and probabilistic computations.          Significant progress has been made during the last two years toward             understanding the complexity of graph traversal.  Viewing the problem           in its natural structured setting was crucial to most or all of these           advances.  This project is following a number of approaches to                  investigate the time and space complexity of graph traversal in                 structured settings.  The goal is to obtain stronger results in the             previously studied structured settings, and novel results in                    substantially richer structured settings.                                                                                                                       Similarly, structured views of important algebraic problems such as             matrix multiplication have been instrumental in advances toward                 understanding those problems.  The project is also investigating the            communication and space complexity of these problems, motivated by the          importance of communication in parallel and distributed computation.",
