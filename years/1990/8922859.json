Grant of Purdue University will                    extend and expand his current investigations on the chemistry                   of gas phase organometallic compounds. The purpose of the work                  is to characterize the kinetics and energetics of important                     elementary reactions of these molecules in the gas phase.                       Pulsed laser radiation will be used to initiate the reactions.                  Transient infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic                 detection methods that span the range of time scales from                       nanoseconds to hours, will be used to monitor the progress of                   the reactions. The understanding of these elementary reaction                   processes will also contribute to the science of catalysis and                  to the development of potentially useful catalysts.                                                                                                             The type reactions to be studied include: (1) elementary dis-                   sociation and recombination reactions of organometallic com-                    pounds with two electron ligands, including unsaturated                         hydrocarbons and carbon momoxide; (2) two-coordinate inter-                     actions of unsaturated metal centers with sigma-(H-H) and (C-H)                 bonds; (3) gas phase transformations of metal-oxo complexes;                    and (4) early transition metal electroplilic carbon-hydrogen                    activation reactions.",
