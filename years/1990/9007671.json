 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gracillariids are a family of minute colorful moths                     comprising more than 1500 species world.wide.  In their early                   developmental stages they live as \"leaf miners\" on woody plants,                and they constitute an economic pest in some areas.  Unlike most                animals, the early stages of gracillariid development are more                  diversified and structurally complex (especially for sap.feeding                forms) than the later stages, which converge on the generalized                 morphology of a moth.  Dr. David Wagner proposes a taxonomic                    revision of the North American species of the family.  Geographic               ranges, life histories, host associations, and morphological data               from reared specimens will be synthesized.  These data will also                be used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among North               American species.                                                                       The proposed research has implications beyond gracillariid              specialists.  The proposed revision will facilitate ecological                  research and will help attempts to control this economically                    important pest.  The resulting genealogical framework will allow                future studies to explore the evolution of different life                       histories and developmental pathways.  This group and this                      research project will attract the attention of developmental                    biologists, ecologists, systematists, functional morphologists,                 and evolutionary biologists in general.",
