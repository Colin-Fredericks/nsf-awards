 "awd_abstract_narration": "For roughly the past 100 years classifying stars according to                   their spectral features has been of inestimable value in the                    astronomical sciences.  This kind of classification is the basis                of much of our present understanding of the physical structure                  and evolution of stars.  Until recently, such classification                    systems have been limited to the optical range.  It is now                      possible to extend them into the near-infrared (NIR) range.                                                                                                     The Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to develop a NIR classi-               fication system for stars throughout the  Hertzsprung-Russell                   Diagram that will complement the traditional optical                            Morgan-Keenan (MK) system.  In establishing the NIR system, the                 PI will take full advantage of the high quantum efficiency of                   modern silicon- based detectors in the wavelength range of                      approximately 5800-9000 angstroms.                                                                                                                              Like the MK system, the NIR system will be based on the                         appearance of the various spectral lines, bands, and blends.  The               new system should contribute to the study of red and heavily                    reddened stars, the initial mass function of low and high mass                  stars, the luminosity function, stellar variability, and star                   counts.  The observational work will be carried out with the                    36-inch telescope and a charge-coupled device (CCD) of the PI's                 home institution, located at a dark site 5000 ft above sea level                and 40 miles SE of Monterey.",
