 "awd_abstract_narration": "Teeth comprise a significant portion of the fossil record,                 and thickness of dental enamel has been used as a measure to                    distinguish among human and ape fossils.  Yet, we still do not                  know how thickness is determined.  Enamel thickness is the result               of three poorly known processes: rate of formation, length of                   formation time, and number of cells that are producing it.                           This project is a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)                       analysis of three major parameters of dental microstructure                     (enamel prism cross-striation repeat interval, Striae of Retzius,               and pattern of enamel decussation) in great apes and humans.  The               measurement of these parameters will permit the reconstruction of               crown formation time and thus provide a better understanding of                 the determination of enamel thickness.  Large samples of molar                  teeth will be studied to provide baseline data for the                          interpretation of fossil teeth.                                                      There is considerable controversy among anthropologists                    concerning the nature and pattern of dental development in living               and fossil apes and humans.  This study will establish the                      homology of enamel thickness categories, and similarities or                    differences in the developmental pathways that were followed to                 achieve enamel thickness in different hominoid primates.  These                 results will be of relevance to any studies of enamel thickness                 and development in other primate groups.",
