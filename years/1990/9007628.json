 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Drennan, Mr. Jeffrey Blick, a               graduate student in the University of Pittsburgh Anthropology                   Department, will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.  For               many years Dr. Drennan has conducted archaeological research in                 the Valle de la Plata region of Columbia, an area noted for its                 impressive prehistoric sculptured stone figures.  He has linked                 these to the development of complex chiefly societies.  Mr. Blick               will examine one stage of this process in detail.  Focussing on                 the Middle Period which dates from 0-850 A.D., he will examine                  ceramics from existing surface collections and conduct soil                     phosphate testing as well as extensive survey to locate intact                  sites.  He will then excavate four to six residential areas to                  recover household information.  These individual households will                then be compared to examine potential differences in wealth and                 economic stratification.                                                                                                                                        In recent years many archaeologists have focussed on the question               of how complex societies develop and the role which emerging                    social inequality plays in this process.  Archaeological data                   make it clear that differences in prestige existed since limited                numbers of large and impressive burial structures are known to be               associated with this time period and these indicate differences                 in individual status.  It is not known, however, whether these                  also reflect variation in individual wealth, and Mr. Blick's                    excavation of residential units will provide relevant data.                                                                                                     This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 increase our understanding of how complex societies originally                  developed.  Second, it will provide information of interest to a                large number of archaeologists who study the culture history of                 Middle and South America.  Finally, it will assist in the                       training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
