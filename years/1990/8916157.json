 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the dissertation research of a                       Harvard University graduate student in anthropology who will                    study the beliefs and experiences of middle-class cancer patients               in a middle-sized Mexican city.  The focus will be on the                       cognitive and social means used by people to cope with the                      disease.  Methods include qualitative ethnographic participant-                 observation in hospitals and clinics and in-depth interviewing as               well as surveys of clinic patients.  This will be one of the                    first ethnographic studies of cancer patients that focuses on the               middle-class, rather than the poor in a developing country.                                                                                                          This research is important because cancer is a common yet                  dreaded disease.  Increased knowledge of how people understand                  their illness and deal with it in various circumstances will                    proved insight into the human context of chronic illness.",
