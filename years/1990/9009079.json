 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voltage collapse ia a loss of stability in                                      large scale electric power systems which                                        causes blackout when voltages decrease                                          catastrophically.  Explanations of voltage                                      collapse involving various subsystems                                           (generators, transformers, loads is unknown).                                   The main purpose of the research is to                                          determine which subsystems and parameters are                                   primarily responsible for voltage collapse so                                   that a simple power system model capturing the                                  main causes of voltage collapse may be                                          developed.  Such a model would form the basis                                   for the scientific understanding and                                            prevention of voltage collapse.                                                                                                                                 Voltage collapse is generally associated with                                   bifurcation of the nonlinear power system                                       equations; that is, the disappearance as                                        parameters vary of the stable equilibrium at                                    which the power system is normally operated.                                    The goal of the proposed research is to                                         determine how the subsystems and parameters                                     contribute to the bifurcation (and hence the                                    voltage collapse) by studying the geometry of                                   the bifurcation and reducing the condition for                                  bifurcation to a simpler form.  Other                                           parameterised nonlinear systems lose stability                                  in a similar way and most of the techniques                                     developed will apply generally.",
