 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of how investments in roads and other forms of physical            infrastructure affect regional economic development in developing               nations have tended to focus on large-scale economic activities.  Over          the last few decades, however, a major share of the economic growth in          developing nations has been in small-scale enterprises (SSEs), some of          which operate within formal legal structures, some of which do not.             The concentration of investments in infrastructure in many nations have         benefitted larger urban centers, often to the relative detriment of             smaller cities and rural areas.  This doctoral dissertation proposal            will examine the relationships between infrastructure investments, the          establishment of small-scale enterprises, and the growth of market              centers and nearby locales in rural parts of Kenya.  Existing and               potential SSEs will be identified through census inventories and                financial records, leaders from a sample of SSEs will be surveyed to            determine how current and perceived investments in infrastructure               affect locational decisions, and a more general model of regional               economic impacts of infrastructure improvements will be developed.                   This project will provide valuable data and analyses of how                decisions to improve the infrastructure within developing countries             affect the economic vitality of rural areas.  Although focusing on a            case study in Kenya, the insights from this project will be of great            use to persons conducting related work elsewhere.  This project also            will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to          continue to develop independent research skills.",
