 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is part of a collaborative  project among                       Professor McIntosh of the University of Massachusetts (Amherst),                Professor Vali of the University of Wyoming (Laramie), and                      Professor Gogineni of the University of Kansas (Lawrence).  The                 objective is to study fine-scale structure of clouds using                      millimeter-wave radars.                                                              Historically, cloud structures and dynamics have been probed               at two widely separate resolutions.  On the one hand, airborne                  microphysical probes, such as the widely used laser optical                     probes, have volume resolution of the order of 1.E-4 to 1.E-2 m3                for 1-second samples.  On the other hand, ground-based research                 radars at wavelengths greater than 1 cm typically have volume                   resolution of the order of 1.E4 to 1.E7 m3.  However, some                      important processes in cloud evolution lie between these two                    resolution categories; these include ice formation, entrainment,                in-cloud mixing, and initiation of coalescence.  The development                of depolyment of millimeter-wave radars supported by this award                 will allow scientists to better understand these fine-scale                     processes with appropriate tools.                                                    During the first half of this project, the Principal                       Investigators will conduct ground-based experiments at the                      UWyoming Elk Mountain Observatory and examine the radar                         backscatter data from ice crystals of known shape, size and                     habitats at 35, 95 and 215 GHz.  During the second half of this                 project, the UMass fully polarimetric 95 GHz radar will be                      installed in the NCAR King Air research aircraft; collaborating                 with NCAR scientists, the Principal Investigators will                          investigate how such a facility can serve the greater                           meteorology community.",
