 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of Dr. Osmund Holm-Hansen of              Scripps Institution of Oceanography and several other U.S. marine               scientists in an international workshop on Polar Marine Ecology  to             be held in Trondheim, Norway.  The workshop has been designed                   specifically to bring together the scientists who were actively                 involved in the \"Norwegian Research Program for Marine Arctic                   Ecology\" (PRO MARE).  The convener of the workshop and director of              the subject research program is Professor Egil Sakshaug of the                  University of Trondheim.  PRO MARE was an intensive five year                   ecological study of the Barents Sea sponsored by Norway, which                  invited many investigators from other countries (primarily the U.S.)            to participate in the multidisciplinary research cruises.  The                  emphasis of the research was to quantify the processes affecting food           web dynamics, and evaluate how these rates are affected by physical,            chemical and optical parameters.                                                                                                                                The workshop offers an opportunity to discuss and begin to synthesize           the broad range of data acquired during PRO MARE into an ecosystem              analysis of the Barents Sea, as well as examining their relevance to            general polar oceanography.  The Barents Sea has some oceanographic             features which make it an excellent \"model\" system to study biological          problems which have world wide significance.  These include the                 development and importance of frontal systems for enhanced primary              production, the relationship between phytoplankton productivity and             depth of vertical mixing as influenced by meteorological conditions,            and the biological and physical importance of the melting of the                annual sea ice.  All six U.S. researchers whose travel will be                  supported by this grant have had much personal involvement with the             PRO MARE program; they will have much to contribute and learn during            the multidisciplinary discussions.",
