 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER project will examine the feasibility of using lighter                 than airships (blimps) to follow various aspects of cetacean                    biology such as the time/space variability in population                        structure, diving and submergence behavior, and migratory                       movements and behavior, as well as in depth studies of                          important breeding and nursery grounds along the US Atlantic                    coast.  The airship time is being donated by the FUJI                           corporation on its FUJI airship and by Metropolitan life on its                 METLIFE blimp and thus the award involves an important                          commitment and cooperative effort with the private sector.  The                 donated time will be provided on an opportunistic basis,                        dependent on primary commitments.  The project will evaluate                    and make recommendations on the use of these new advanced                       airships for ocean surveys of marine mammals and their habitats                 and should further extend our basic understanding of space and                  time population variation and general behavior of these                         interesting and endangered organisms.",
