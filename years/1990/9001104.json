 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stones often are found along relatively horizontal planes within           soils, appearing as lines in soil cuts, thereby leading to their                designation as stone lines.  The morphology of stone lines long has             been explained in terms of accumulation of mass-wasted or wind-blown            deposits over previously settled materials, but recent studies have             indicated that stone may be realigned within the same soils through the         actions of small mammals and insects.  This doctoral dissertation               project will test the hypothesis that both the stone line within the            Sangamon soil layer in central Illinois and the overlying layer of              coarser material are the products of sorting activities by mound-               building animals.  Stone lines from a sample of sites among drumlins in         McDonough County will be examined through analyses of the location and          orientation of stones and through biofabric analysis of the materials,          which will provide information on the environmental conditions under            which the soils evolved.                                                             This project will provide a well-structured test of competing              hypotheses regarding soil morphology, shedding light on the conditions          at the study site and for a broader range of locales.  This project             also will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young                scholar to continue to develop independent research skills.",
