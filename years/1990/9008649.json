 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is for the renewal of a highly productive research                   program at Marquette University (DMR-8701160), which resulted in                several scientific papers and graduate students in the area of                  thermodynamic properties of compound semiconductor materials.  In               addition, undergraduate students were involved with the research                thereby attracting promising students to graduate careers in                    science and engineering research and teaching.  The research                    during this grant period emphasizes experimental determination of               chemical bond energies of the substitutional acceptors, zinc and                cadmium, in germanium, silicon, and mercury-telluride.  The                     partial pressure of zinc and cadmium over solid solutions in                    silicon or germanium-containing acceptor dopants is being                       determined from the optical absorbance of the vapor phase using                 hollow cathode lamps.  The chemical potential and partial molar                 enthalpy and entropy are determined from the data.  Likewise the                same thermodynamic parameters are being determined for mercury                  and cadmium zinc telluride.  In addition to the research, the                   program has a significant impact on the infrastructure by                       training students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels                 in this critical science.",
