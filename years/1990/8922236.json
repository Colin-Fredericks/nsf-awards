 "awd_abstract_narration": "The export assembly industry has been operating in Ciudad                       Juarez, Mexico, for about 20 years, employing a predominantly                   female work force.  The factories (maquilas) are the Mexican                    version of a large and expanding global phenomenon:  tax-                       sheltered export-manufacturing industries with a gender-                        specific demand for low-wage labor that give women relatively                   good earning opportunities in these geographically-                             concentrated enclaves.  While speculation and anecdotes                         abound, there is little empirical study of the consequences                     of this development strategy for the way of life of members                     of the labor force.  Some observers have framed the question:                   \"Through the practice of hiring women, are the maquiladoras                     undermining the Mexican family?\"                                                                                                                                The Principal Investigator proposes to look at the causes and                   consequences of women's work in this significant sector of                      the global economy.  Her study asks two different questions:                    (1) Given the demand for female labor, what factors influence                   the household's decision about which family member to supply                    to the maquiladoras for work?  (2) Once women get formal jobs                   in the industrial sector, to what extent is their autonomy                      within the male-dominated household increased?                                                                                                                  A sample of 700 female maquiladora workers will be                              interviewed about these two broad concerns.  Their reponses                     will be analyzed in comparison to those of a group of 700                       women who are similar in many ways except for engaging in                       other types of work (service sector or informal economy).                       The aim of this study is to increase understanding of the                       connection between economic activities and gender equality.",
