 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently we have been developing a new paradigm for learning concepts of        probability and fractals which focuses on a form of Guided Discovery in         which cues are placed in such a fashion that the student is able to             follow in the footsteps of a researcher.  In order to learn more about          this alternative route to learning science, we propose to hold a                workshop to bring together both phy7sical scientists and cognitive              scientists, as ell as high school teachers and students.  In the first          phase of the meeting, participants will work with the hands-on                  activities and the computer software and cecome familiar with their             content and format.  Next, specialists in cognitive science will propose        research methodologies that can be used to determine what students who          use these materials are learning, and how their learning process differs        from that in a more traditional science class.  Does the introduction of        multiple representations lead to the development of higher order                thinking skills?  Can a visual representation in a computer simulation          provide an alternative route to learning science for the student who            does not deeply understand mathematics?  What features of the                   educational setting can lead to a revolution in high school science             teaching?  How could answers to these questions affect the development          of further games, activities, and computer programs, both at Boston             University and elsewhere?  Finally, what resources must be assembled to         carry out this program of study and research?  The outcome of the               workshop will be an over-arching vision, a research strategy, and a set         of tactics.",
