 "awd_abstract_narration": "Miscible polymer blends have a simple continuous                           relationship between properties and composition, when amorphous,                unlike many immiscible blends whose properties may fall below                   those of the components.  Miscible blends of high-preformance                   polymers with less expensive polymers consequently offer the                    advantage of specifying performance levels within wide limits for               minimum cost.  The goal of this research is to advance the                      principles, through example, for controlling phase behavior of                  blends of this type through molecular structural design.  In                    particular, this research focuses on identifying examples of                    miscible blends of existing or new high-performance polymers,                   such as polycarbonates, polysulfones, polyacrylates, etc. with                  less expensive polymers based on commodity monomers like styrene,               methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, etc.  The strategy is to                    find homo-polymer pairs that are energetically close to the                     border of miscibility and then use copolymerization to make them                usefully miscible via the benefits of intramolecular repulsion                  effects.  A search for such systems must be guided by                           principles, since the number of compositional variables is too                  great to randomly explore them all.  This work involves                         application of the latest theories of miscibility and techniques                for quantifying interactions in addition to synthesis of targeted               polymers or copolymers.  In addition to identification of                       potentially useful materials, this work should answer important                 basic question aboutintermolecular interactions.",
