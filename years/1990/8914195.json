 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a cooperative research project in                       polymer chemistry between Professor Henry K. Hall, Jr.,                         Department of Chemistry, University of Arizona, and Professors                  Shouji Iwatsuki and Takahito Itoh, Faculty of Engineering, Mie                  University, Nagoya, Japan.  The scientists will study reactions                 of electron-rich, donor olefins with electrophilic                              quinodimethanes.  Previous studies by Professor Hall on                         reactions of electron-rich olefins with electron-poor,                          acceptor olefins led to development of his Bond-Forming                         Initiation Theory, which proposes that tetramethylene                           intermediates, either ionic or free-radical, are the initiators                 of the spontaneous polymerizations that frequently occur in                     these systems.  This theory has been successful in explaining                   results obtained in the olefin-olefin systems, and the                          investigators in this project wish to examine its extension to                  reactions of olefins with quinodimethanes                                                                                                                       Dr. Hall, an organic polymer chemist, has considerable                          experience in synthesizing new monomers and polymers and in                     investigating the basic mechanisms of polymerization.  Dr.                      Itoh has synthesized a variety of novel quinodimethanes and                     has studied their polymerization reactions.  He recently spent                  a year in Dr. Hall's laboratory in Arizona pursuing this                        research.  The U.S. and Japanese scientists will cooperate in                   synthesizing monomers especially suited for these studies, in                   attempting to trap reaction intermediates, and in carrying out                  detailed kinetic studies of the reactions.  Some of the                         polymers to be investigated here have potential applications in                 such high-technology areas as non-linear optical materials and                  piezoelectric materials.",
