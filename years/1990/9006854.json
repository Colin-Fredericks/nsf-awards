 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant pathologists have frequently suggested viruses are                   parasites of chloroplasts.  The investigators will integrate                    approaches from plant population biology, physiological ecology,                and  pathology to test the hypothesis that virus infection in                   leaves of herbaceous plants growing in the shade may limit their                ability to acclimate to, and to occupy bright light habitats. A                 field study in which three species from shaded and sunny habitats               will be infected with known viruses has been designed to test the               significance of virus interactions with photosynthesis under                    natural conditions.  The species selected, Solanum dulcamara,                   Plantago lanceolata, and Anthoxanthum odoratum, have all been                   thought to show ecotypic differentiation with respect to sun and                shade, and all are known to carry many viruses under field                      conditions.  It is possible that symptoms of terminal                           photoinhibition (leaf yellowing in the sun) previously associated               with shade ecotypes may reflect the consequences of viral                       infection.                                                                           New methods of chlorophyll fluorescence imaging will be                    developed which can diagnose impaired photosynthesis in virus                   infected leaves prior to symptom expression.  These non-intrusive               methods will be used to screen populations of plants for changes                in photosynthesis which will be linked to plant growth,                         fecundity, and survival following infection.  Such                              instrumentation may well find application in horticulture, where                virus infection of plants in nursery cultivation is rampant.",
