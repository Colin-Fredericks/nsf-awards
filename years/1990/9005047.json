 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are examining the telomere region of the fruitfly, Drosophila                melanogaster, as a model for metazoan telomeres.  We have shown                 that in Drosophila, in contrast to yeast, a chromosome from which               the terminus has been deleted can be transmitted for many                       generations.  Our structural analysis of the subterminal portion                of the telomere region has revealed a complex interspersion of                  different repetitive sequences.  Preliminary results suggest an                 unexpectedly high frequency of terminal and subterminal length                  variations.  In addition, we have documented a case in which the                expression of a gene was repressed when it was transposed to a                  subterminal site.                                                                                                                                               The termini of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres, are                    specialized structures thought to be required for chromosome                    stability.  It has recently been shown that a characteristic                    terminal sequence motif is conserved among unicellular eukaryotes,              vertebrates and higher plants.  In many eukaryotes the telomere                 region also encompasses more complex repetitive sequences that are              shared among all or a subset or the chromosome tips.  Telomeres                 have been studied most extensively in single-celled eukaryotes and              there is little known about the overall sequence organization,                  functions, or dynamics of the telomere region of multicellular                  eukaryotes.***",
