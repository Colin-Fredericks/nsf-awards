 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made in the Materials Chemistry and Chemical                      Processing Initiative in support of the collaborative research                  of Professors Strouse and Anet at the University of California                  at Los Angeles. Joint funding is provided by the Divisions of                   Chemistry and Materials Research. The thrust of the research is                 the synthesis, characterization and applications of                             programmable lattice clathrates prepared from metalloporphyrins.                                                                                                Crystalline metallotetraphenylporphyrin complexes represent a                   class of lattice clathrates in which the axial coordination                     sites of the porphyrin metal atoms are directed into                            hydrophobic channels. This feature provides a simple means for                  programming the clathrate lattice which will be the basis for a                 new strategy for molecular recognition, to exercise control                     over the metal atom environment, or to manipulate the structure                 of the porphyrin lattice. Applications will be sought which                     will take advantage of the rich chemistry of metalloporphyrins,                 the accessibility and selectivity provided by the channel                       structure, and the rigidity of the clathrate lattice. Materials                 characterization and synthetic modification studies will be                     directed toward applications which range from chemical                          separations to energy conversion.  Parallel chemical studies                    and computational analyses will be designed to provide a more                   fundamental understanding of the dynamics and energetics of                     clathrate binding. The database afforded by the combined                        investigations will allow efficient exploitation of these                       materials in a broad range of scientific and technological                      applications.",
