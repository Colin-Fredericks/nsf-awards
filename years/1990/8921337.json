 "awd_abstract_narration": "The modified signed-digit (MSD) number system, because of its inherent          weak interdigit dependance, has been suggested as a useful means for a          fast and parallel digital arithmetic.  Recently, using various optical          logic and memory processing techniques, optical MSD arithmetic                  operations have been proposed.  However, in most existing optical               schemes, a multiple-stage algorithm is utilized.  For a multi-stage             approach, because of optical cascading, additional signal energy loss           and speed reduction is unavoidable.  To maintain a fast processing              speed, a single-stage holographic optical content-addressable memory            (CAM) based MSD algorithm was suggested.  However, due to its                   sophisticated three-step phase-switching recording, its experimental            implementation is difficult to achieve.  In this research program, a            novel non-holographic opto-electronic CAM based fast MSD addition               processing architecture is developed.  The proposed concept has been            verified with our first-order proof-of-principle experiments.  As figure        of merit comparison of this and other existing approaches has also been         made.  Based on this key opto-electronic CAM element, implementation of         more sophisticated MSD arithmetic operations are possible.  Finally, for        the completion of a MSD arithmetic processing, the conversion between           the conventional binary and MSD numbers, an issue that other optical            approaches did not address, is also under investigation.",
