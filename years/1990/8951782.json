 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biochemistry at                  Colorado State University to develop a modular approach to                      teaching state-of-the-art undergraduate biochemistry                            laboratories.  Rather than the traditional one semester lecture-                oriented lab course, the new curriculum involves a semester-long                introductory module that emphasizes hands-on mastery of the                     fundamental techniques and instrumentation used in present-day                  biochemical and molecular biological research.  Students then                   progress into three modular courses which apply the fundamental                 techniques and instruments (Protein Purification and                            Characterization; Recombinant DNA Technology; Cellular                          Biochemistry).  The basic methods module and three specialized                  modules will provide undergraduate biochemistry majors and other                molecularly-oriented bioscience majors with a strong laboratory                 background that will enhance their competitiveness and                          productivity.  The equipment purchased through this award will                  also be used in a thoroughly revised and updated lab course for                 non-majors that services about 250 students per year.                           Acquisition of state-of-the-art instrumentation will not only                   permit installation of the new modular curriculum, it will also                 be crucial in designing and instituting the laboratory portions                 of a Secondary School Science Teacher Workshop that is currently                planned.  The grantee is matching this award with non-Federal                   sources.",
