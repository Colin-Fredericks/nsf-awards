 "awd_abstract_narration": "At this REU Site electrical engineering seniors will gain research              experience by participating in projects in microelectronics and                 photonics.  Specifically, they will work on continuing and new                  projects in a) advanced silicon processing for devices and integrated           circuits, b) high-power and high-frequency bipolar transistors and              other microwave devices, c) III-V compound quantum nanostructures, d)           non-crystalline silicon structures for energy conversion, e) basic              semiconductor material studies and f) ASIC design for high-frequency            circuits and systems.  They will work on these projects full time               during the summer and part time during the academic year.  Cooperation          with Lincoln University, North Carolina A & T, and the State                    University of New York- New Palz, and institutions with a significant           minority enrollment is planned.  A microelectronics fabrication course          each summer with teaching responsibilities shared by all four                   participating faculty is offered.  Students will be able to transfer            the course credits to their home institutions.  A number of these               research-trained and motivated students will continue into graduate             studies and elsewhere; consequently, graduate students interested in            microelectronics and photonics from the program participants will be            actively recruited.",
