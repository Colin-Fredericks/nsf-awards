 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to study the use of                                  a particular non-linear system identification                                   scheme to determine the in situ cyclic                                          properties of soils, using records of the                                       response of such soils to the strong ground                                     shaking induced by large earthquakes.                                                                                                                           Soils are known to exhibit significant non-                                     linear behavior even under moderate ground                                      shaking.  The degree of this non-linearity can                                  have a large effect on the response of soils                                    to strong ground shaking, and hence on the                                      response of structures founded on these soils                                   to the earthquake loading.  The use of non-                                     linear system identification methods is                                         difficult and any particular scheme is limited                                  in its application.                                                                                                                                             This study is investigating the use of the                                      Extended Kalman Filter to identify the in-situ                                  cyclic properties of soils existing in shear                                    beam type soil structures.  The first phase of                                  the research involves a numerical parametric                                    study aimed at finding guidelines for such                                      issues as: sensitivity of the initial                                           estimates, the required number of parameters,                                   the effects of measurement noise, the impact                                    of ground shaking intensities, and the                                          relationship between global iteration and                                       convergence.  The second phase applies these                                    results to the downhole instrument records                                      measured during earthquakes.  Emphasis is                                       placed on the consistency of the estimates and                                  the accuracy of the estimates in comparison                                     with laboratory test data.",
