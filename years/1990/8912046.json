 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing international interest in global change has stimulated             development of longer records of natural conditions in order to better          compare naturally controlled change with the processes induced or               accelerated by human activity.  Scholars increasingly have gone                 underground in recent years, examining sediments in caves to determine          whether pollen and microfossils in those deposits can provide long-term         records of environmental conditions.  This project will continue                analysis of materials gathered in ten caves from seven different                African nations.  Preliminary analyses have estimated the dates of some         of these materials to 350,000 years before the present.  By continuing          the process of estimating the age of materials and associating those            materials with specific types of vegetation in regions surrounding the          caves, project leaders should be able to more completely and more               accurately reconstruct ecological conditions at the cave sites over             long time periods.  These reconstructions will then provide a basis for         more accurate estimation of climate and other natural conditions in             those regions.                                                                       This research is significant because it will provide considerably          more information about paleo-ecological conditions in different parts           of Africa over hundreds of thousands of years.  These data will                 complement long records gathered for other locales and dated using              other methods of measurement, thereby providing an improved basis for           examining the nature and processes of natural environmental change              throughout the world since the Pleistocene epoch.  This research also           will increase knowledge about the paleoecological reconstruction                methods used in this study and about the limitations in the use of cave         sediments as sources of information about natural environmental                 conditions, knowledge that will help scholars examining environmental           change in both historic and current timeframes.",
