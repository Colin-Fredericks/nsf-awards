The advancement and wide                                              applications of electronic devices and                                          microprocessors in many areas significantly                                     contribute to electrical waveform distortion.                                   This created the need for basic research on                                     principles and methods of instrumentations of                                   electrical quantities in non-sinusoidal                                         situations.  Also, there are many situations                                    in large scale systems, where a disturbance                                     cause fluctuation in many fundamental                                           frequency and nominal voltage.  The                                             measurement of such fluctuations from highly                                    distorted waveforms will certainly contribute                                   to the fast detection of the disturbance.                                       Therefore, this proposal includes three major                                   tasks to be achieved.  First, to establish the                                  proper definition of the quantities to be                                       measured in non-sinusoidal situations.  The                                     confusion and discrepancy of distorted power,                                   active power, reactive power, and power factor                                  in non-sinusoidal waveforms will be addressed                                   in a scientific and experimental manner.  The                                   second task will be concerned with the                                          development of microprocessor-based optimal                                     estimation techniques for the measurement of:                                   waveform effective value, fundamental                                           component RMS value, time domain active,                                        reactive, apparent and distorted power.  Also                                   the development of microprocessor based                                         techniques for recursive estimation of                                          frequency deviation will be investigated.  The                                  third task deals with a hardware                                                implementation, a laboratory testing and an                                     investigation of the measurement technique for                                  active, reactive, and apparent power.  The                                      errors in each approach will be evaluated.",
