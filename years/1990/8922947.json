The JTEC program                                            was initiated in 1983 to examine                                                Japanese research and development in                                            selected areas of technology and to                                             access the impact of this R&D on                                                future U.S. economic competitiveness.                                           Each selected technology is studied by                                          a panel of experts who, in addition to                                          their broad knowledge of the field,                                             travel to Japan to see firsthand the                                            current Japanese research activities.                                           The panel then conducts an open                                                 workshop to present its results, and                                            it provides a written report.  Unlike                                           corporate studies of the same sort,                                             the reports of the JTEC panels are in                                           the public domain and are accessible                                            to both private individuals and                                                 Federal policymakers.  This effort                                              will extend the JTEC studies to                                                 include five additional technologies.                                           An additional study will be conducted                                           in Europe to verify that the                                                    methodology that has been used in                                               Japan will be effective there.  The                                             detailed research will be conducted by                                          six expert panels that will analyze                                             foreign literature, visit foreign                                               laboratories, and present their                                                 findings in workshops and technical                                             reports.",
