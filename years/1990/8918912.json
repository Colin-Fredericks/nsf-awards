 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Blitz will investigate how the interstellar medium evolves from             the diffuse state which is characteristic of most of its volume                 into the dense molecular state from which stars are formed.  He                 will perform detailed observations of small molecular clouds                    without star formation which are found preferentially at high                   galactic latitudes, and which appear to have ages of less than                  3,000,000 years.  These young objects are imbedded in the atomic                gas sheaths out of which the molecular clouds condensed, and Dr.                Blitz hopes to identify the reasons why some parts of the atomic                gas becomes molecular in these relatively simple clouds.  He will               make detailed comparative studies of the gas and dust associated                with two giant molecular clouds that seem to be in different                    evolutionary states in order to understand how the structure of a               giant molecular cloud evolves with time.  Dr. Blitz will also                   explore the role of the molecular gas in the nuclei of Seyfert                  galaxies.                                                                                                                                                       In the fundamental stellar cycle, where the interstellar gas is                 collected into stars ultimately to be enriched with heavy elements              and ejected back into interstellar space, one of the least well                 understood phases is the evolution of the diffuse gas into dense,               star forming molecular clouds.  We currently know very little about             how the diffuse interstellar medium collects itself into giant                  molecular clouds and how these molecular clouds ultimately fragment             into individual stars and clusters of stars.  Dr. Blitz' research               aims to illuminate the physical mechanisms by which the                         interstellar medium is prepared for the formation of new stars.                 That is, he seeks to understand how diffuse gas ultimately forms                dense proto-stellar cores, the evolution of which as been                       aggressively investigated by many workers.",
