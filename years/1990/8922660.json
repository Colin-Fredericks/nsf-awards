Implementation of a two-phased risk management                                  delivery system will achieve the following                                      objectives.  Phase I will develop and test a                                    risk analysis model in Louisville, Kentucky,                                    and design a university-based risk management                                   data service to provide updated risk analysis                                   information and continuous consultation.                                        Phase II will develop and evaluate a                                            technology transfer strategy targeted for                                       water supply companies located in the seven                                     states that are part of the Central United                                      States Earthquake Consortium (CUSEC).                                                                                                                           This project, which will be disseminated to                                     municipal water supply systems, offers several                                  rewards.  It will aid in achieving acceptable                                   performance of water supply systems under all                                   hazard conditions that have the potential to                                    produce breakdown in the system.  It will                                       provide the opportunity to determine with                                       greater certainty which elements of the system                                  are subject to breakdown from earthquakes and                                   other hazardous events.",
