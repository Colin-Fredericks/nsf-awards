 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electromagnetic (EM) inverse problem is nonunique, that                is an infinite number of models fit the data if any do at all.                  One approach to this problem is to generate models which are                    maximally smooth in some sense, thereby assuring that the true                  Earth is rougher that the models.  This it is unlikely that the                 models contain elements of structure which do not feature in the                Earth.  Also, the smooth inversions reflect the true resolving                  power of the EM method.  We have developed this technique for                   most 1D problems and have an initial code which generates models                for the 2D MT problem.  The PIs will extend 1-D inversion to                    include the 2D resistivity problem, and to use these codes to                   examine resolution for 2D MT, resistivity and joint inversion.                  As important (or more so) as models generation is the matter of                 existence of a model which fits the data under the assumptions                  of dimensionality.  While t;he existence problem has been solved                for 1D MT and resistivity, little has been done for 2D existence                criteria.  Once the existence problem has been solved, the smooth               inversion scheme is made more powerful, as the iterative                        inversions can be started from a feasible solution.",
