 "awd_abstract_narration": "The facility for High Resolution Electron Microscopy continues                  its programs which have two principle aspects:  the development                 of new techniques, methods for data analysis and instrumentation                for advanced high resolution electron microscopy on the one hand,               and the provision of services, assistance and education for the                 national electron microscopy community on the other hand.  Major                recent developments include the installation, evaluation and                    initial application of two new electron microscopes designed for                observation of specimens in ultrahigh vacuum or controlled                      environments, as part of a large scale effort to integrate the                  techniques of surface study with those of high resolution                       microscopy so that the field of surface science may be extended                 to include studies with atomic resolution.  Increasing                          contributions are being made by facility users to the advancement               of many areas of solid state science, including studies of                      semiconductor defects and interfaces, supported metal and oxide                 catalysts, chemical reactions in the solid state, the structures                of minerals, structures and defects of high temperature                         superconductors and several aspects of disordered systems.                      Interactions of the facility with industrial laboratories                       have been enhanced by the establishment of an Industrial                        Associates Program.  The future will see an expanding role for                  the high resolution electron microscopy and associated                          techniques and for the facility in key areas of condensed matter                science and technical developments which will enhance the                       effectiveness and productivity of the advanced instrumentation.",
