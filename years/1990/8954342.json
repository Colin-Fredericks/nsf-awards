 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconductor optoelectronics is becoming increasingly important in             science and engineering.  It is therefore highly desirable that                 engineers and scientists should be introduced to optoelectronics at an          early stage in their careers.  Much of the relevant material can and            should be incorporated in undergraduate curricula.  The Center for High         Technology Materials at the University of New Mexico, in partnership            with Sandia National Laboratories, is conducting a seven day workshop           in semiconductor optoelectronics for twenty-five undergraduate                  teaching faculty in university physics and engineering departments.             The workshop includes lectures, laboratory tours/demonstrations, and            hands-on laboratory sessions in epitaxy of III-V direct-gap                     semiconductors, fabrication, processing and characterization of                 optoelectronic devices such as semiconductor injection lasers, and              application such as optical fiber communications.                                                                                                               This project facilitates the inclusion of semiconductor                         optoelectronics as an undergraduate discipline by developing within             faculty a basic knowledge and appreciation of the subject, providing            direct contact with some of the latest experimental and theoretical             advances, and by establishing  and ongoing and mutually beneficial              interaction between undergraduate faculty and a national center of              excellence in the field.",
