 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Robert               Caverly, Southeastern Massachusetts University and Drs. Christopher             Snowden and Michael Howes, Department of Electrical and Electronic              Engineering, University of Leeds, England.  The objective of this               project is a study of nonlinearities in microwave control devices.                                                                                              Semiconductor devices are presently being used to control and                   switch power and energy signals in a variety of applications.                   Ideally, these devices switch the energy without introducing                    distortion (caused by nonlinear operation of the devices) into the              circuit or system.  In practice, however, distortion is produced                which is directly related to the signal that is controlled.  The                research work proposed is an investigation of the device and                    circuit parameters that will affect the generation of this signal               distortion.  Dr. Caverly has carried out extensive theoretical                  modeling of solid state devices.  The Leeds Microwave Solid State               Group has considerable experience not only in this area, but also               in modeling and fabricating circuits and systems.  The joining of               these complementary skills will provide improved understanding of               the performance of passive and active field effect transistor                   circuits, especially those in monolithic microwave integrated                   circuit applications.",
