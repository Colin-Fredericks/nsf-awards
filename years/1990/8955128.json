 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Science and Mathematics at Columbia College                   has developed a highly successful method of teaching science                    to people who do not have extensive science backgrounds.  A                     major component of this unique approach is the integration of                   science with the humanities and the arts.  This project will                    attempt to transfer that method of instruction to a program                     designed to improve the knowledge and teaching skills of                        middle school science teachers.  A series of workshops using                    this creative approach and lasting four weeks will be offered                   during three consecutive summers.  Under the \"umbrella\" theme                   of environmental science, the topics of physics, chemistry,                     geology and biology will be studied, through laboratory                         experiences, discussions, and lectures.  Teachers will                          demonstrate their mastery of the material by creating and                       presenting projects which incorporate their talents and                         interests.  The projects will be able to take the form of                       paintings, films, videos, dances, poems, photoessays,                           sculptures, drama or journalism.  During each afternoon                         teachers will reflect on the methods of instruction being                       used to teach them science during the workshop and plan ways                    to transfer such methodology to their own classrooms.                                                                                                           The cost sharing for the program will be fifty percent of the                   NSF portion.",
