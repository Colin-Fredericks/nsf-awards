 "awd_abstract_narration": "In developing countries with market economies, small-scale                 enterprises are a growing part of rural nonfarm economic activity.              Women's participation in rural small-scale enterprises is gaining               increased recognition.  Despite the increased interest in rural women's         small-scale enterprise activity, little attention has been directed             toward the spatial dimensions that may constrain or encourage women's           enterprises.  This doctoral dissertation research will investigate the          impact of isolation from principal market centers on the establishment          and management of small-scale enterprises by women in Kenya.                    Adjustments that women make in managing small-scale enterprises as they         attempt to meet their obligations as providers for their families               through a combination of many different productive activities may be            related to their carrying out business transactions in more isolated            markets, such as periodic markets, or in village-level markets.  The            project will use questionnaires administered to women entrepreneurs in          rural districts.  Responses will provide a database for testing                 hypotheses that examine differences in the operations of women's                small-scale enterprises in association with more isolated and less              sophisticated rural markets.                                                                                                                                         By addressing influences of spatial isolation on women's economic          development, the project will add an innovative empirical and                   theoretical study to the growing body of geographical research on               development-related issues.  It will provide information to assist in           the formulation of specific policy plans for enhancing the more                 complete participation of women in rural development.  The project also         will provide an excellent opportunity for a promising young scholar to          continue to develop independent research skills.",
