 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in Particulate systems Engineering in crucial to advances in           combustion, atmospheric and environmental sciences, nuclear winter              studies, nuclear reactor safety, and materials manufacturing.  The              purpose of this project is to provide research experiences for                  undergraduate students in this area.  At least half of the students             will be selected from institutions other the UMC, with several                  recruited from Stephens College (a women's college), Lincoln                    University (HCBU), and other undergraduate schools in the State.  Each          student will undertake a specific research project, and a faculty               advisor (participating in the REU program) will work with the student           to develop his/her research skills.  An essential element of the                program will be its emphasis on professional development of the                 students (e.g., paper writing and technical presentations).  The                purpose is to infuse bright undergraduate students with an enthusiasm           towards research careers, including graduate level education.                                                                                                   The University of Missouri-Columbia has made substantial institutional          commitments to the program.  These include support of faculty time,             waiver of tuition and fees for the student Participants, waiver of all          overhead costs, and stipends for two minority students (in addition to          those supported by the NSF funds).",
