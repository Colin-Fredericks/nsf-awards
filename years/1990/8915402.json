 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to continue the sampling and geochemical                 analysis of Galapagos lavas to the off-shore regions of the                     platform in order to define the nature of the Galapagos                         hotspot.  Sampling, analysis and dating, combined with the                      analysis of gravity data, will permit the testing of the                        thermal entrainment  of Mid-ocean Ridge basalt material into                    the center of the Galapagos plume.                                              %%%                                                                                  One of the most interesting problems in understanding the                  geochemistry of rocks emplaced on the sea floor is the                          determine  the nature of the interaction between processes that                 generate basaltic rocks that are found in a normal ocean ridge                  axis environment and process associated with deep seated hot                    spot plumes in the mantle.  Preliminary study of rocks from the                 Galapagos platform show that rocks from the interior of the                     platform look like normal mid ocean ridge basalts, whereas                      those  on the margins of the platform have compositions                         resembling plumes-type rocks.  This rock sampling and                           analytical program will help test an interesting hypothesis                     developed by geophysicists regarding the dynamics of plumes                     that can give rise to the unusual geochemical signature.  The                   personnel for this project are most appropriate because Dr.                     Christie has considerable experience at sea, Dr. McBirney has                   done considerable work on the Galapagos Islands, Dr. Richard                    has developed the hypothesis that is being tested.  Drs. Duncan                 and White provide the necessary analytical expertise.",
