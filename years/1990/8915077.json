 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Prof. Richard Shiavi of Vanderbilt                      University in a research collaboration with Prof. Antonio Pedotti               of the Centro di Bioingegneria in Milan, Italy.  The purpose of                 the research is to combine the expertise at both centers in order               to investigate and analyze human locomotion.  The researchers                   plan to develop several gait analysis procedures for a single                   laboratory environment that would utilize current measurement                   techniques, analytic procedures, and interactive graphical                      interfaces.                                                                                                                                                     The extensive adaptability of motor control of locomotion makes                 bipedal locomotion extremely versatile, but consequently, makes                 its investigation extremely difficult.  Depending upon the aspect               of gait being investigated, some combination of electromyographic,              kinematic, and dynamic measurements are required.  Prof. Shiavi has             developed several techniques for analyzing muscle activity while                researchers in Milan have developed procedures to analyze the                   dynamics of locomotion and study motor control.  By combining                   these techniques and procedures, the researchers intend to develop              and make available to researchers and clinicians quantitative                   analytic tools useful in gait evaluation.",
