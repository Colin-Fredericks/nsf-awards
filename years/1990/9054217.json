 "awd_abstract_narration": "Object-oriented software development has emerged from research labs             to have signficant effect on computer science.  Undergraduate                   students exposed to object-oriented concepts have a richer set of               design models to use than do those acquainted only with functional              decomposition techniques.  The program is teaching these concepts               to select undergraduate faculty, thus increasing the number of                  students who benefit from exposure to object-oriented principles.                                                                                               The primary teaching method is hands-on experimentation with                    Smalltalk/V, an excellent vehicle for exploratory programming.                  Projects are being supplemented with discussions on wider issues,               such as object-oriented analysis and design, other object-oriented              languages, and issues in teaching these concepts to undergraduates.                                                                                             Participants take Smalltalk/V back to their home institutions both              for use in a larger project, and as an aid to spreading knowledge               about object-oriented techniques to their colleagues.  A spring                 follow-up session provides an opportunity for the group to discuss              their projects, as well as their experiences with using this                    material in their classes.",
