 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researchers propose three projects designed to promote basic                plant science and ecological research at Florida State University:              (1) to construct and equip one 3100-sq.-ft.  Freon-air-conditioned              greenhouse, (2) to re-skin and refurbish one older greenhouse, and              (3) to purchase six new plant growth chambers.  These facilities                will be used for a variety of both single-and multiple-user                     projects.  A sample of proposed research that would use these                   facilities includes studies of the transfer of traits between plant             species by means of somatic hybridization (Bates, major user), the              evolution of plant competitive performance as a function of                     environmental conditions (Miller, major user), the role of                      essential polypeptides in the water-oxidizing complex of                        photosystem II (Homann, major user), the importance and mechanisms              of inter-and intracellular sucrose movement in plant leaves                     (Outlaw, major user), interactions among natural enemies, physical              factors, and plant nutrition in their effects on the population                 dynamics of planthoppers (Strong, major user), the basis of                     patterns of population differentiation and divergence at different              spatial scale (Winn, major user),and interactions between selection             and gene flow in determining patterns of adaptive variation in                  poeciliid fishes (Travis, minor user).",
