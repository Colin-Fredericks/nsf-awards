 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vertebrate fossil collection of the University of                      Nebraska constitutes one of the most important records of                       vertebrate evolution, especially of Cenozoic mammals, in the                    Great Plains of North America.  It is large (more than one                      million specimens), historically important (143 holotypes), and                 is heavily used by an active curatorial staff and numerous                      visiting scientists.  Two serious problems, however, prevent the                research potential of this unique resource from being fully                     realized.  First, at least one-third of the collection is stored                in insecure, unlit, unheated temporary shelters 40 miles from the               Museum's research facility on the University campus.  University                officials, cognizant of the problem, have made space available in               a more modern building on campus and have agreed to renovate 8500               sq. ft. of this facility for the reception of the endangered                    collection, much of which is unprepared, research-quality                       Neogene mammal material collected through federally-funded field                programs in the 1930s.  This project provides funds for                         transporting this material to the new facility and for its                      initial preparation and stabilization.  The second need addressed               by the project is for upgrading the active research collection                  already housed in an excellent modern facility on the University                campus.  Only about 1/3 of this collection is currently stored in               functional metal cabinets; the remainder is arrayed, in various                 degrees of inaccessibility, in deteriorating wooden cabinets or                 stacked in cardboard boxes.  This project provides funds to                     reorganize and markedly enhance the usefulness of this                          collection.",
