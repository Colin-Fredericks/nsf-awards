 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to use both a biochemical and                      genetic approach to study how bacteriophage QB synthesized RNA                  and stores the information that promotes its own transmission and               multiplication.  Using a cloned cDNA of the QB replicase cistron,               experimental systems have been developed that uncouple replicase                function from replicase synthesis.  Using these systems, site-                  directed linker insertion mutations have been put in the                        replicase coding sequences and then these were assayed for the                  effect of each mutation on replicase activity and also QB genome                function.  Previous results have enabled the separation of the                  RNA sequences that code for activity replicase from the sequences               that are required for template recognition, chain elongation, and               translational regulation.  More recently phylogenetic sequence                  comparisons between two different bacteriophage RNAs have located               several conserved regions of RNA and amino acid sequence that may               have functional significance.  These sites will be targeted                     for site-directed mutation and delection analysis.                              The mutant replicases and genomic viral RNAs that carry the                     different alterations will be studied both in vivo and in vitro                 to determine the effect(s) of each change.  This library of                     mutants will provide important information about the different                  functional domains of the replicase genes coding sequences as                   well as the active sites contained within. Why study an RNA virus               Replicase? Since RNA viruses are one of the few self-reproducing                units that use a genetic material other than DNA, the survival                  problems faced by these genomes have few parallels elsewhere in                 biology.  They infect representatives from all known life forms                 including prokaryotes, fungi, animals, and plants; and because of               the high error rate exhibited by their polymerases during                       multiple cycles of replication, RNA genomes can diverge rapidly.",
