This is one of               eleven winners under that competition.                                          This project involves an integrated program of theory building,                 software tool development and assessment, and controlled                        experiments in distributed group support systems.  Such systems                 embed group decision support system tools and procedures within a               computer-mediated communication system.  The primary objective of               the project is to build a general theory, supported by empirical                evidence, to understand how variations in group structures and                  software tools affect the process and outcome of decision making.               This multi-disciplinary effort focusses on synchronous computer                 conference, in which participants are distributed in different                  locations, and on asynchronous computer conference, in which                    participation is distributed in time as well as space.",
