 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relative roles of chloroplastic amylolytic enzymes in                       intiating leaf starch degradation and metabolizing the                          immediate products of starch grain degradation are unknown.                     The roles of the extrachloroplastic amyloytic enzymes in                        photosynthetic tissues have yet to be elucidated.  In species                   that have been examined, most of the amylolytic activity in                     photosynthetic tissues is extrachloroplastic, with B-amylase                    found primarily in the vacuole and a-amylase primarily in the                   apoplast.  This research identifies the chloroplast                             amylolytic enzymes that can directly attack leaf starch                         granules, and those that cannot, and determines how these                       enzymes might act together to degrade leaf starch; (2)                          characterizes chloroplastic and extrachloroplastic a-                           glucosidase; and (3) verifies or disproves the localization                     of the primarily apoplastic a-amylase, the primarily vacuolar                   B-amylase, and a-glucosidases by immunohistochemistry.                                                                                                          Starch, an end-product of higher plant photosynthesis, is                       stored in leaves, stems, roots and seeds as an energy                           reserve.  During the night and other periods of reduced                         photosynthetic rates, starch degradation is the most                            important source of substrates for metabolic processes in                       leaves of many higher plants.  Although leaf starch                             degradation is an important process in the regulation of                        plant metabolism and plant development, little is known about                   its regulation.  Identification of the enzymes that actually                    attack leaf granules is a prerequisite to elucidating the                       mechanisms which regulate starch degradation and, therefore,                    carbon metabolism in plants.***//",
