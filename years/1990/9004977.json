 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research indicates that calcium ions and signal-modulated ion                   channels may play a central role in plant cellular signal                       transduction.  Guard cells provide an ideal system for the study                of plant signaling, as these cells respond dynamically to hormone               and light stimuli in regulating gas exchange.  Recent data                      suggest that calcium regulation of ion channels in the plasma                   membrane of guard clls provides a basis for physiologically-                    observed calcium dependent stomatal movements.  Preliminary                     results show that abscisic acid induces increases in cytosolic                  calcium, which in turn may trigger stomatal closing, thus                       protecting plants from desiccation.  The goals of the proposed                  research are to achieve an accurate understanding of the                        molecular mechanisms by which cytosolic calcium and other ions                  regulate inward rectifying potassium channels and by which                      mechanisms abscisic acid exerts control over these processes.                   Isolated guard cells will be studied by simultaneous patch clamp                analysis and photometric measurements of cytosolic calcium,                     allowing the direct investigation of effects of cytosolic and                   extracellular modulators on signaling events.                                                                                                                   The knowledge gained from these studies will contribute                         substantially to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms                  controlling gas and water exchange in the leaves of plants and                  will provide a quantitative description of biophysical and                      biochemical regulation of ion channels in higher plant cells.",
