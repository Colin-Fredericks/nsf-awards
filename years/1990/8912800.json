 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an experimental                    program to investigate the deposition of hard-to-plate metals                   from nonaqueous supercritical electrolyte solutions.  The                       focus of the present study is to investigate the effects on                     the pressure- and temperature-dependent physicochemical                         properties of the solution in the mixture-critical region on                    the deposition process with nonaqueous mixtures of two                          solvents in order to avoid the extreme temperatures and                         pressures needed with supercritical water.  It is not                           currently possible to a priori characterize the deposits                        produced by electrodeposition in the mixture-critical region                    fundamental information will be obtained which can be used to                   develop guidelines for controlling the deposition process.                                                                                                      This work will lead to a novel way to electrodeposit hard-to-                   plate metals, such as aluminum, titanium, and lithium, from                     nonaqueous media which could potentially alleviate the                          difficulties associated with controlling the deposit quality                    or the stability of the solution.  The key technical objective                  which must be addressed is determining the benefit of using a                   supercritical fluid electrolyte medium as opposed to a liquid                   medium.  The impact of this work is to address the issue of                     deposition at moderate temperatures in a medium which has                       liquidlike solvent capacities and gaslike transport                             characteristics.  The technical information generated here can                  have a major impact on similar processing techniques currently                  practiced with liquid-phase electrolyte solutions.  Although                    it should be recognized that the advantages of using                            supercritical fluids depend on each specific application,                       deposition from supercritical electrolyte solutions could lead                  to new methods for producing materials such as thin film                        semiconductors, organic compounds, alloys, and electroformed                    superconductors.",
