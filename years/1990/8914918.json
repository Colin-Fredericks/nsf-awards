 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a joint cooperative research project                    entitled \"Vortex Dynamics and Organized Structures in Turbulent                 Shear Flows\" between Professor Fazle Hussain and colleagues at                  the University of Houston and Professor Masaru Kiya of                          Hokkaido University in Japan and other Japanese investigators.                  The researchers note that fluid turbulence is one of the most                   intriguing yet difficult-to-understand physical phenomena                       facing scientists and engineers.  The inherent nonlinearity of                  the governing equations of fluid motion and the resulting                       (apparently) random turbulence are largely responsible for                      this difficulty.  Turbulent shear flows are characterized by                    coherent structures, but knowledge about the detailed                           topological characteristics of these structures and their                       dynamical behavior is scarce.  To provide insight into this                     area the researchers will study several shear flows such as                     jets, wakes, mixing layers, and Taylor-Couette flows.  Coherent                 structure topology and dynamics will be studied experimentaly                   in these flows using two computerized measuring techniques.                     Models will then be developed and analyzed to predict chaotic                   evolutions of coherent structures in turbulent shear flows.                     This research could lead to a further understanding of                          turbulence management (manipulation of technologically                          important phenomena such as transports of heat, mass, and                       momentum; entrainment; mixing and chemical reaction, including                  combustion; and generation of drag and aerodynamic noise).                                                                                                      Both the U.S. and Japanese principal investigators are highly                   respected engineers.  Each has established a record of                          significant contributions in his respective area.  This award                   will expand and sustain their productive cooperation, which                     should prove beneficial to the entire turbulent flow community.",
