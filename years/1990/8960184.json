 "awd_abstract_narration": "Photochemical reactions of compounds absorbed in or absorbed                    on solids is in an early stage of development as a means of                     producing useful chemicals on an industrial scale.  This                        process can be used for example for photofixation of nitrogen                   and photo-oxidations, isotopic enrichment, photochlorination,                   as well as other chemical synthesis.  This Small Business                       Innovation Research Phase I is aimed at exploring the                           commercial viability of using  a rotating fluidized bed with a                  light source at the core, as a high efficiency photochemical                    reactor.                                                                                                                                                        A rotating fluidized bed is essentially a vertical cylinder                     with porous walls which rotates around its axis of symmetry.                    The particulate matter is forced against the wall due to the                    large centrifugal forces produced by the rotation.  The wall                    serves as a gas distributor for the bed and the gas flows                       radially inward through it and through the bed particles.                       When the drag forces on the granule balance the centrifugal                     forces, the bed becomes fluidized.  The system  to be                           developed will be designed with a lamp in the core and with                     the facility for addition and removal of solid during the                       reaction.  These rotating fluidized beds should be adaptable                    to the use of solar energy.  The sunlight could be collected                    and be transferred with mirrors or through fiber optic bundles                  to the reactor.  This could be done for purely solar sytems or                  in combination with artificial light for systems that require                   continuous operation.                                                           Specific research objectives for Phase I are:                                   . Design and build a prototype rotating photochemical                           fluidized     bed reactor.                                                      . Determine the relative quantum efficiency of the rotating                     bed   vs. the parallel plate bed using well understood                          photochemical    reactions.                                                     . Determine the effects of variables, such as speed of                          rotation,    fluidizing gas flow rates and particle size, on                    quantum          efficiency.                                                    . Develop theoretical models for the photochemical rotating                          fluidized bed for design of the second generation                          systems.                                                                        . Evaluate the rotating bed for both isotopic enrichment and                        photochlorination technologies.",
