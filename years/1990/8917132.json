 "awd_abstract_narration": "The three-dimensional structure of the enzyme B-hydroxydecanoyl                 thioester dehydrase from E. coli will be determined by X-ray                    crystallography.  This enzyme is essential for biosynthesis of                  unsaturated fatty acids in E. coli by catalyzing both                           dehydration and double-bond isomerization reactions.  The                       enzyme is known for its property of suicide inhibition by thiol                 esters of 3-decynoic acid.  This specific, irreversible,                        covalent modification of the enzyme will be exploited to                        provide heavy-atom labels for the crystallographic structure                    determination.  The crystal structure will be solved by use of                  anomalous dispersion due to heavy-atoms incorporated in the                     inhibitor compounds.  Very strongly diffracting crystals of the                 subject enzyme indicate that the structure determination can                    proceed to very high resolution.  Accordingly, crystallographic                 studies at ultra-low temperature will be pursued in order to                    define structural details to the fullest extent possible.  The                  results of the structure determination are expected to explain                  the enzyme's high degree of specificity for substrate acyl, to                  verify that a single active site is responsible for catalysis                   of the two enzymatic reactions, to point out possible                           similarities to other proteins that bind hydrophobic molecules,                 and to provide additional data on atomic mobility in protein                    molecules.",
