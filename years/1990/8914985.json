Golbeck, Department of Chemistry, Portland State University;            Professor Isamu Ikegami, Teikyo University, Sagamiko, Japan; and                Professor Shigeru Itoh, National Institute of Basic Biology,                    Okazaki, Japan.  The scientists are collaborating in a study of some            of the basic processes occurring when photosynthesis takes place in             green plants and cyanobacteria.  They are focusing on the lower-                potential system (Photosystem I) of two photochemical systems                   involved sequentially in the overall photosynthetic process.  This              cooperative project is based on the combined individual abilities of            the U.S. and Japanese researchers to remove and then put back,                  selectively, the chlorophyll molecules, the phylloquinone molecules,            and the iron-sulfur clusters that make up the reaction center.  This            newly developed, selective resolution and reconstitution protocol,              combined with the scientists' ability to effect polypeptide -                   protein rebinding, offers new opportunities to address longstanding             questions regarding the pathways of electron flow in Photosystem I.             By leaving some of the components out when reconstructing the                   complex, the function of these subunits may become better understood.           Some of the components may also be chemically altered or exchanged              before the complex is reconstituted, in order to synthesize artificial          or modified centers, and the effect determined.  In addition, use               of certain iron and sulfur isotopes will permit various spectroscopic           studies to be carried out, yielding structural information regarding            the complex.",
