The proposed algorithm, Conditional                     Stochastic Decomposition (CSD), is based on stochastic                          decomposition, a newly introduced algorithmic concept for the                   solution of two stage stochastic linear programs with recourse.                 While stochastic decomposition is essentially a version of                      Bender's decomposition with an embedded randomizing agent, CSD is               an algorithm that makes maximal use of each available observation               of the random element.  The research includes two major tasks.                  The first involves analytic verification of CSD, and will lead to               the development of computational expedients, including                          cut/variable elimination and aggregation techniques.  The second                involves an empirical investigation of the algorithms performance               characteristics, and will necessarily include the development of                test problems.  As preliminary tests with a basic version of                    stochastic decomposition suggest that it is ideally suited for                  the solution of large scale two stage stochastic optimization                   problems with recourse, the development of CSD as an                            optimization/simulation interface should allow for the solution                 of such problems when the stochastic nature of the problem is                   sufficiently complex to preclude its description with closed form               distributions.",
