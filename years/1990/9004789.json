 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just prior to and immediately after the mass extinctions                   used to mark the end of the Cretaceous eutherian (placental)                    mammals underwent a major evolutionary radiation.  Systematic                   analyses of these mammals, based on their gross dental                          morphology (the primary suite of characters available for                       analysis), have resulted in neither full clarification of their                 phylogenetic interrelationships nor in understanding of the                     adaptive (functional) differences that contributed to the                       radiation.  Learning and applying the techniques involved in                    analysis of the microstructure of mammalian enamel will provide                 an additional suite of characters that can be used to address                   these problems and research techniques that can be passed on to                 graduate students who are faced with similar problems in their                  research.  A sabbatical leave during the academic year 1990-1991                and an invitation to work in the laboratory of Professor Dr.                    Wighart von Koenigswald, Director of the Palaontologisches                      Institut der Universitat Bonn (BRD). will provide a new research                environment, time to learn new research techniques and the                      opportunity to take a fresh approach to research on the patterns                and causal factors of the early radiation of eutherian mammals.",
