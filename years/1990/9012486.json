 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences initiated in 1985 is a yearly                  event devoted to the molecular biology and genetics of plant                    pathogenic bacteria, fastidious prokaryotes and related areas                   dealing with these and other microorganisms.  This year's                       conference follows the ancillary field of broad-host-range (or                  \"promiscuous\") plasmids, the first meeting of which took place in               Birmingham, England in the summer of 1987 (sponsored by EMBO).                  The Fallen Leaf Lake Conferences offer the special opportunity                  for plant pathologists to interact with experts in a particular                 field.  Only the latest unpublished information is exchanged at                 the Fallen Leaf Lake conference and ample opportunity for                       scientific interactions is provided during the course of the                    conference.  The conference is attended by members representing                 most of the major laboratories from many different countries, and               therefore provides excellent opportunity for graduate and                       postdoctoral student to interact with internationally recognized                experts in a specific field.",
