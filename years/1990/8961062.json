 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are numerous important atmospheric trace gases with                  absorption lines in the visible to near ultraviolet.  The                       absorption cross sections for these gases are moderate, but                     their extremely low concentrations (some below part-per-                        trillion levels) make them difficult to measure.                                     The Phase I effort will investigate a technique for                        increasing the sensitivity of intracavity laser absorption                      spectroscopy, with application to the detection and measurement                 of trace gases in the atmosphere.  The technique places a                       multipass absorption cell within the resonant cavity of a dye                   laser.  With an intracavity multipass cell, the optical                         absorption pathlength can be increased by a factor of ten to                    thirty over the typical values of experimental systems.                         Intracavity laser spectroscopy may increase sentivity by a                      factor of ten or more over the previous state of the art.                            The general goal for Phase I research is to demonstrate                    and explore the behavior of a tunable dye laser that has an                     intracavity long-path multi-pass absorption cell.  The                          applicability of such a laser system to the problem, of                         measuring weakly absorbing atmospheric gases will be evaluated.                 An atmospheric trace gas measurement instrument based on this                   system would have many of the properties desired in modern                      atmospheric                                                                     chemistry research.  These properties include:  high sensitivity,               fast response, point measurement capability and ruggedness.",
