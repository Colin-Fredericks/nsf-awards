 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the period of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research             award, the principal investigator will complete an initial                      investigation of the applicability of a unique mathematical                     technique based on the methods of stochastic state-space modeling               and Bayesian filtering to the prediction of protein structural                  class.  This research will complete a pilot study, which so far has             demonstrated that our approach is capable of correctly                          discriminating more than 80% of the time between predominantly all              alpha and predominantly all beta proteins.  In addition, it will                allow for a proper comparison with other methods, and a full                    statistical evaluation of the predicted classification sensitivity              and specificity.                                                                                                                                                     One of the fundamental problems in molecular biology is that               of relating a protein primary sequence to its function.  The                    function, whether structural or catalytic, is encoded in the                    protein's structure, often in the details of the three-dimensional              arrangement of amino-acid side chains on the surface.  The                      principal investigator is suggesting a method of prediction of                  protein structural classes from protein sequence data.  His method              employs stochastic modeling and Bayesian filtering.",
