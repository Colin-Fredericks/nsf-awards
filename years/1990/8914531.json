 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative research in atomic and                          molecular physics to be conducted by James McGuire and C.D.                     Lin of Kansas State University and Roberto Rivarola and Ruben                   Piacentini of the National University of Rosario, Argentina.                    This work will involve the development of theoretical models                    of atomic and molecular collisions.  A new class of inelastic                   processes in atomic collisions with highly charged ions will                    be investigated.  This is made possible by new ion sources,                     developments in the study of laboratory plasmas and new                         access to antimatter beams.  Inner-shell and outer-shell                        phenomena will be included and the collision speeds will                        range from slow to fast with single particle and multiparticle                  excitations.  These scientists have been involved extensively                   in the development of theoretical models which provide an                       understanding of new experimental results and on which are                      based systematics for further experimental tests.                                                                                                               This research will build on an increasing cooperation between                   these scientists beginning in 1981.  Both groups published                      studies of electron capture and initially, contact was made                     through international meetings and correspondence.  In 1988,                    McGuire and Rivarola collaborated on a study of electron                        capture from molecules by fast ions and have submitted a joint                  paper.  They have just begun a study of electron distribution                   in atomic ionization.  This grant will formalize the                            cooperation between them and allow contact with other                           theorists in both countries.",
