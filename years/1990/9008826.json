 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mediation is often used as a diplomatic intervention and a                      counterpoint to violence in the resolution of international                     conflicts.  However, often it is not successful.  Researchers have              attempted to identify the factors responsible for the difficulty                in resolving conflicts.  Most of the literature on negotiation and              mediation identifies mediator roles and describes strategies and                tactics that are useful at different points in a conflict, but it               does not systematically examine power as employed by mediators nor              does it recognize the importance of leverage in the mediation                   process.  This is partly due to the fact that most mediation theory             is built on the premise that mediators must be \"neutral\" in order               to be acceptable to the parties and effective in their role.                    Paradoxically, mediation practice frequently contradicts this                   axiom.                                                                                                                                                          This doctoral dissertation research will examine the relationship               between the types of leverage exercised by powerful mediators and               the responses of disputing parties that move the conflict toward                or away from resolution.  Using a comparative case study method,                a series of hypotheses will be generated about the conditions under             which mediators with leverage and power can be effective.  Three                cases form the core of the research:  The first is the mediation                done by the Western Contact Group (U.S., Britain, Canada, France,               West Germany) from 1977-81 in the dispute between South Africa and              Namibia over Namibian independence.  The second case is the U.S.                State Department mediation in the same dispute from 1981-1989.  The             third is the British mediation in Zimbabwe in 1979.  Data will                  include interviews from key negotiation participants as well as                 primary and secondary source documents.                                                                                                                         This study will expand mediation theory to incorporate insight into             the \"powerful mediator,\" asking how such mediators use their power              and under what conditions the violation of the axiom of non-                    partisan intervention is appropriate and effective.  This research              will have implications for theory and practice in international                 conflicts as well as in other contexts where mediators play a role              in resolving disputes.  It will also add to understanding of the                social psychology of international relations.",
