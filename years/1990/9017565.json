 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electric power systems are examples of integrated                               complex nonlinear large-scale systems.  These systems                           contain a variety of components from a simple linear                            time-invariant continuous or discrete-time system to a                          complex nonlinear time varying stochastic system, each of                       which can be modeled. Because of these characteristics                          conventional analysis and control design methods cannot                         be applied to present and future electric power systems.                        The research supported in this project is to develop                            analytical tools suitable for analysis and control of                           complex electric power systems.  Specifically, the project                      focuses on:  (1) methodology to identify the critical                           modes in a given power system and expand this algorithm                         to derive coherency measures, (2) an algorithm to                               determine the minimum number of decentralized                                   actuators and sensors and their most effective locations,                       (3) a method to design robust decentralized controllers,                        and (4) applications of these techniques to power system                        stability and control problems.  These algorithms are                           effective for a wide range of operating conditions.  The                        methods are developed by investigating eigenstructure                           dynamics, sensitivity analysis, transfer function residues,                     and robust control design theory.  The problem is                               formulated in deterministic as well as stochastic                               frameworks using time and frequency domain techniques.                          Issues such as model uncertainties, nonlinearities, wide                        range of loading conditions, structural changes, controller                     structures, and computational efficiency will be the foci                       of the research.",
