 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now know that 238U-230th and 230Th-226Ra disequilibria in                 recent volcanics can be large, can differ in kind and extent                    according to tectonic environment, and can appear complex between               coexisting minerals in zero-age rocks.  It is also known that Th                isotope ratios vary by more than most other isotope ratios, yet                 can be measured by Mass Spectrometer to <1%, or to within 1/1000                of the observed range.  There also is potential to measure other                short-lived nuclides, such as 226Ra and 231Pa mass                              spectrometrically as well.  This will be a focused effort to                    explore the potential of high resolution, small-sample studies of               U-Th-series systematics in young volcanic rocks.  In particular                 it is planned to pursue four kinds of research over the next                    three years:  1) continued regional-scale study of subduction                   zones, in connection with two other monitors of slab recycling                  processes and timescales, Be and B; 2) continued study of                       submarine tholeiitic basalts from backarc basins; 3) continued                  study of magma chamber processes for magmas ranging in viscosity                from carbonatite to rhyolite; and 4) continued study of global                  correlations of Th-Sr-Nd-Pb isotope ratios.",
