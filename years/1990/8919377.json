It promises to produce new data                on this relationship, for although research on the relation                     between stress and cortisol has been a part of the infant                       research literature for many years, such research has not                       included behavioral measures.  Intensity of discomfort and                      cortisol release has also been studied in past research, but                    again, the behavioral correlates have been neglected.  Bringing                 standardized behavioral observations into the study of infant                   stress promises to provide a better understanding of the factors                that influence infants' stress reactions.  This program of                      research promises much information on the relationship between                  stress and physiological and behavioral reactions to it.  Studied               over varying stress intensities, and over children of different                 ages, the study promises to tell us much about the effects of                   stress on infants.  This information is important both                          theoretically and practically, and will enrich our understanding                of fundamental developmental processes in infancy.  ***//",
