 "awd_abstract_narration": "All of us have, at one time or another, taken special pains to                  place a prized object in some special location where it would be                well hidden.  We were also sure we would never forget this                      location.  However, when it was time to retrieve the object, we                 could not remember where we had hidden it.  Some species of birds               in the western U.S. perform a similar behavior, but with one                    important difference.  They appear not to forget the location of                their hidden treasure.                                                                                                                                          One of the most dramatic examples of the use of spatial memory is               provided by seed-caching birds that remember the location of                    thousands of distinct locations for many months.  Spatial memory                in these species is robust and of long duration.  In this series                of experiments, Dr. Balda and his colleagues will study the                     nature of this memory system in Clark's nutcracker, pinyon jays,                and scrub jays using carefully managed laboratory procedures in                 which many variables can be manipulated and controlled.                                                                                                         In nature, these birds spend hundreds of hours each autumn                      harvesting pine seeds from native conifer trees, carrying these                 seeds off some distance, and then burying the seeds in                          underground caches.  These cached seeds are not exposed and                     cannot be detected.  Yet, these birds return to these cache sites               months later and recover their caches with almost errorless                     accuracy.                                                                                                                                                       Questions to be addressed include:  How many cache sites can a                  bird remember?  How long can these sites be remembered?  How does               this behavior develop in young birds?  Are there species                        differences in how much information birds can remember?                                                                                                         The results of this research will help us to understand spatial                 memory at both the evolutionary and behavioral levels and to                    develop an understanding of animal cognition in a broad                         biological and psychological perspective.",
