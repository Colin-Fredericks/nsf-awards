 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of this study are to obtain an                          understanding of the annual cycles of bacterial biomass and                     production in the open sea.  Such studies have previously been                  identified by the JGOFS program as necessary core measurements,                 which are considered essential for a better understanding of                    carbon and nitrogen fluxes through planktonic systems.  The                     studies will be conducted at the Bermuda Biological Station for                 Research (BBSR) in the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS).  In                 order to make high precision estimates of bacterial production                  initial studies will examine a number of radioactively labeled                  compounds such as thymidine, adenine, and leucine by conducting a               series of calibration experiments for an empirical determination                of conversion factors to be used for the different compounds.  In               the second year, regular sampling of the annual cycle of                        bacterial biomass and production at stations off Bermuda will                   begin in conjunction with the ongoing BBSR/JGOFS cruises.  In                   addition, more detailed and intense studies will focus on two                   critical periods, the spring phytoplankton bloom and the                        conspicuous summer subsurface bacterial abundance maximum which                 has been identified in previous work conducted at Bermuda.                      Finally, work on modelling ecosystem structure at Bermuda will be               continued and extended which will provide data for model                        validation, and developing new models of plankton dynamics.",
