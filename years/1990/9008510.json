The                   program seeks to enable US scientists and engineers to                          conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or compli-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a 15 month visit by Dr. John C. Chen                    to go to Australia to work with Dr. Peter F. Nelson of CSIRO                    in North Ryde on \"The Evolution and Reactions of NOx Precursors                 from Coal Volatiles.\"  Coal combustion generates photochemical                  smog and pollutants causing acid rain.  Oxides of nitrogen                      (NOx) are among the most severe of these pollutants, primarily                  the result of oxidation of nitrogen bound in the coal matrix                    (fuel NOx).  This research seeks to clarify several aspects                     of NOx formation from coal volatiles.  The researchers will                     study the evolution of NOx precursors for a range of Australian                 coals in a three-section reactor: the first generates the                       volatiles by rapid coal pyrolysis in a fluidized bed;  the                      second serves as a heated transport line and contains a                         sintered quartz frit to eliminate the char and ash residues                     from the gaseous product stream;  the final reactor is simply                   a tubular quartz furnace where the primary coal volatiles are                   subjected to secondary reactions at various furnace tempera-                    tures and residence times.  The NOx precursors and other                        reaction products will be measured with FTIR, GC, and GC/MS.                    The specific goals of the research are: (1) to measure and                      relate the rate formation of the precursors to forms of                         nitrogen in the tar and the parent coal; (2) to study the                       interactions of the precursors with other coal volatiles and                    with various gas species (including O2) introduced into the                     tubular furnace; and (3) to use these data as input to models                   for NOx formation.  The attainment of these goals will be a                     significant achievement in understanding and predicting NOx                     formation from Australian coals in practical combustion                         devices and the results may be extended to coals of any                         geographic origin.                                                                                                                                              The award recommendation provides funds to cover, as                            appropriate, international travel, local travel abroad,                         stipend, dependents' allowance if applicable, and a flat                        administrative allowance of $250 for the U.S. home institution.",
