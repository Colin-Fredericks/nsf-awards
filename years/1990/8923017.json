 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Roswell Park Memorial Institute                to establish a Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site.  The               objectives of the program are:  (1) to expose the trainees to an                atmosphere of an active research environment; (2) to continually                challenge them to develop an interest in science; (3) to allow the              trainees to witness scientific creativity; and (4) to help them in              planning their academic careers in science.  The students fulfill               these objectives by spending 80% of their time in an active                     research laboratory under direct supervision of a senior                        investigator where they are assigned their own research project to              conduct under the direct supervision of their mentor.  The                      remaining 20% of the time is spent attending lectures and                       multidisciplinary seminars in specific areas of biology, chemistry              and biophysics conducted at the Institute.  The allocation of time              away from the laboratory and in the classroom is important to                   broaden the trainees horizons into other areas of science.  A                   Scientific Mini-conference is held at the conclusion of the                     program.  Students are required to prepare both an oral and poster              presentation for this conference.                                                                                                                               Projects will be assigned to trainees in Cellular and Molecular                 Biology.  The Education Department, with the senior investigators,              carefully match trainees to make sure the college students'                     interests and the objectives of the program are fulfilled.  A one-              to-one relationship between trainee and senior investigator is                  sought when the trainee is assigned to an active research                       laboratory to do his project work.",
