 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for a long term                             \u001a(sabbatical) research visit by Professor Scott F. Gilbert of                   Swarthmore College to the laboratory of Professor Lauri Saxen                   of the Department of Pathology of the University of Helsinki,                   Finland.  They are interested in understanding the early                        events of morphogenesis, and are attempting to establish                        which genes are being activated by the inducer.  Their                          approach is to construct cDNA libraries from uninduced and                      from newly induced mesenchymal tissue in mouse kidney.  By                      comparing those mRNA's from induced and uninduced mesenchyme,                   they will be able to determine which genes are activated by                     the inducer and establish a temporal and spatial sequence of                    kidney induction.  This is emerging as a powerful and                           ultasensitive techniques for identifying early transcriptive                    events.  The collaboration brings together Dr. Saxen's world                    class expertise in embryonic kidney induction, differentiation                  and morphogenesis with the experience and interest of Dr.                       Gilbert in molecular biological methods for studying induction                  and tissue competence.                                                                                                                                          One of the greatest challenges of developmental biology                         concerns how the nuclear genome instructs the morphogenesis                     of complex organs containing intricately coordinated                            arrangements of tissues.  Central to this issue is how cells                    respond to inductive influences from neighboring cells during                   organogenesis.  The induction of the mammalian kidney has                       become a model for such organogenesis where reciprocal                          interactions between two tissues create the rudiments of an                     organ.  The proposed collaborative effort will contribute to                    our understanding of the molecular basis of morphogenesis.",
