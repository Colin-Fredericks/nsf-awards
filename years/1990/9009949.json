In this it is proposed to study the                      surface                                                                         behavior of a binary blend, in which all segments of one chain                  interact identically with the surface, while the end moieties                   of                                                                              the second species, which has the same repeat units as the                      first                                                                           chain, have energetic interactions with the surface that are                    different from the central beads.  Preliminary analytical                       calculations on this subject suggest that the difference in                     energetic interactions between chain ends and middle beads of                   the                                                                             second species with the surface will dictate which component                    will                                                                            partition to it.  It follows that one can maximize the surface                  segregation of an appropriate species from the blend by                         controlling                                                                     the chemistry of the end moieties, thus allowing for the                        design of                                                                       polymer composite with desired mechanical properties.                           Experimentally, these theoretical predictions will be verified                  by                                                                              a new technique, neutron reflectivity.  From a theoretical                      viewpoint, analytical lattice models are being developed to                     examine                                                                         these situations.",
