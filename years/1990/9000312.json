 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alaska will operate the R/V ALPHA HELIX                       during 1990 as a general oceanographic vessel in support of                     NSF-funded research projects.  The R/V ALPHA HELIX is a                         133'general research vessel constructed 1966.  The vessel is                    owned by the National Science Foundation, and operated by the                   University of Alaska under a 5-year renewable charter.  The ship                will operate mainly in the coastal waters of Alaska, Gulf of                    Alaska and Bering Sea.                                                                                                                                          This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                     Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that                   must be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship                  must be specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires                    highly trained crew members for maintenance and operation.  These               vessels do not operate in the same manner as general cargo or                   fishing vessels, and therefore, NSF supports the operation of a                 variety of vessels specifically dedicated to oceanographic                      research.  These vessels are operated by universities and                       research institutions around the country.                                                                                                                       The program recognizes the importance of the R/V ALPHA HELIX to                 the research fleet because it is the only vessel located in an                  Arctic region.  Great interest has been generated in the Arctic                 region during the past few years as Global Change became an                     important issue.  Continued operations of a research vessel in                  the Arctic region is critical, and improvement of our Arctic                    research capabilities is recommended.  Although the R/V ALPHA                   HELIX has a slight amount of ice strengthening that allows it to                operate near ice, the vessel is not capable of true ice                         operations.",
