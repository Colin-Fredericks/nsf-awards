 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several problems in the field of differential equations will               be under investigation during the term of this project.  They                   concern systems of differential equations from the physical                     sciences, namely Lagrangian equations representing forced motion                of a mechanical system and the more general Hamiltonian systems.                A system of forced pendulums would give rise to the first class                 of equations, whereas the motion of bodies under gravitational                  forces often uses the Hamiltonian structure.                                         The Lagrangian equations involved in this study have                       periodic coefficients and forcing functions.  It is natural to                  inquire whether of not there will exist periodic solutions                      under such assumptions.  As with many equations modeling                        phenomena from the physical world, the Lagrangians result from a                principle of energy or action minimization.  One seeks to find                  critical points of a certain integral with admissible functions                 taken from a Hilbert space.  Depending on the growth of the                     potential, there may be many distinct periodic solutions, whereas               evidence suggests that for periodic potentials, only finitely                   many periodic solutions may exist.  A measure of the number of                  such solutions in terms the structure of the potential will be                  sought.                                                                              Work on Hamiltonian systems will follow a similar vein                     concentrating on the case of periodic Hamiltonians.  Solutions of               these systems are known as subharmonics.  There are known to be                 periodic subharmonics under very general conditions.  The most                  important subharmonics are those with minimal periods.  This                    research will look for a description of solutions with minimal                  periods in cases where additional symmetry assumptions are made                 on the Hamiltonian.  Solutions of Hamiltonian systems must lie on               surfaces of constant energy.  A related goal of this work will                  be to determine which surfaces of the Hamiltonian carry a                       periodic orbit.",
