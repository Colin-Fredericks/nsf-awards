 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in federalism have traditionally examined whether certain               goods or services are best provided at the local, state, or                     federal levels of government.  Inefficiencies in local provision                of goods and services can be addressed in a federalist system by                shifting either the production or financing of the local public                 good to higher levels of government .  A much less discussed                    alternative is the imposition of mandates by higher levels of                   government on subordinate units.  Mandates are quantity                         constraints on the subordinate units of government that require                 an increase or decrease in the provision of the good depending on               the direction of the spillover.  This research project develops a               political economy model of federalism that focuses on mandates.                 For empirical purposes, the model emphasizes local and state                    government relationships but it could be easily extended to state               and federal relationships.  The model is empirically tested using               expenditure data for various categories of locally provided goods               and services.                                                                                                                                                   The significance of this project lies in combining the political                process with the normative economic models of local public goods.               Attempts to analyze intergovernment policies cannot be successful               without a positive model of fiscal federalism.  This project                    takes a first step in answering very important policy questions                 regarding the determinants of which levels of government provide                particular goods and analyzing the nature of the interaction                    between levels of government.",
