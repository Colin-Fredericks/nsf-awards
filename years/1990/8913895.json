 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Raima Larter is supported by a grant from the Experimental                  Physical Chemistry Program to study the chemical kinetic origin                 of chaos in selected chemical reactions.  The reactions to be                   studied are models of oscillatory reactions which occur in many                 biologically important processes such as oscillatory membrane                   potential in pacemaker cells in the heart and pancreas,                         organismic circadian rhythms of all types, and the                              cell-division cycle.                                                                                                                                            Dr. Larter will study the origin of oscillatory behavior in the                 peroxidase enzyme catalyzed oxidation of nicotinamide adenine                   dinucleotide.  The research focusses on four questions: 1) Are                  mixed-mode oscillations observed in simulations likely to be                    experimentally observable? 2) What is the mechanism by which                    chaos arises in this system, and does it involve the wrinkled                   torus? 3) What are generic chemical kinetic features giving                     rise to a devil's staircase in mixed-mode oscillations? and 4)                  What is a more realistic, experimentally based mechanism for                    the peroxidase reaction?",
