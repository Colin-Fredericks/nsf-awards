 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research proposed here is to develop a molecular theory                     for aqueous solvation of macromolecules.  Specifically, Dr.                     Ichiye is interested in the solvation of entire folded                          proteins, not just subunits or homopolymers.  The most                          straightforward approach to the solvation of macromolecules                     would appear to be via computer simulations, such as                            molecular dynamics simulations, in which all the solute and                     solvent molecules are modeled.  However, when the size or                       number of macromolecules increases, this becomes impractical                    because of the large number of solvent molecules needed for                     sufficient layers of solvation, especially when there are                       long-ranged Coulombic forces.  Rather than explicitly                           simulating all of the solvent molecules, Dr. Ichiye proposes                    to develop analytic theories of solvation which include the                     molecular nature of the solvent.  This approach involves                        integral equation theories which predict the molecular                          structure of liquids given the same intermolecular potentials                   as used in computer simulations.",
