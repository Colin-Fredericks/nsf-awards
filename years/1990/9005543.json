 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cell's mechanism for regulating microtubule assembly in the                 cytoskeleton and mitotic apparatus during mitosis remains                       undefined.  This laboratory has demonstrated that control of                    intracellular calcium is essential for mitotic regulation, and                  has isolated and reconstituted the mitotic apparatus calcium pump               and a putative mitotic apparatus calcium channel.  In                           collaboration with Drs. Shinya Inoue and Osamu Shimomura, Dr.                   Silver has succeeded in quantitative imaging of calcium with the                photoprotein aequorin and single photon video imaging.  The next                goals of this project are to continue the enzymatic and                         biochemical characterization of the mitotic apparatus                           endomembrane calcium pump and calcium channel, to elucidate the                 temporal limits imposed upon regulation and coordination of                     pathways required for mitosis that are managed through the cell                 cycle clock, to elucidate the role of phospholipase activity and                specific products of phospholipid metabolism in regulating                      intracellular calcium during mitosis, and to continue                           quantitative two-dimensional imaging and computational analysis                 of the spatially and temproally regulated transicent calcium                    signals that control mitosis using the photoprotein aequorin and                single photon digital video light microscopy.                                                                                                                   Cell division involves the ordered remodeling of microtubule,                   microfilament, intermediate filament, and endomembrane arrays                   within the cell.  The cellular mechanisms initiating and carrying               out cell division (mitosis) are, as yet, not understood, but a                  considerable body of evidence suggests that transient elevations                of intracellular free calcium are essential in signaling specific               mitotic events.  The goal of this research is to understand how                 and where in the dividing cell changes in calcium levels take                   place.  A detailed understanding of the regulation of                           intracellular calcium within the mitotic apparatus will provide                 deeper insight into the mechanisms controlling cell division.",
