 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on previous projects funded by NSF and the State of                    Tennessee, this 1.5-year project addresses the problem of                       improving mathematics instruction in secondary schools,                         especially middle schools.  During the academic year, fifty                     teachers (including ten alternates) of grades 5 through 8 will                  deepen their mathematics backgrounds by taking specially                        designed courses in algebra and trigonometry.  During the                       summer, forty of these teachers will join twenty high school                    teachers in a five-week workshop that includes instruction in                   discrete mathematics and basic computer science, as well as                     discussion of appropriate teaching strategies.  Teams                           consisting of two middle school teachers and one high school                    teacher will collaborate on the development of lesson plans.                    Participants will be drawn primarily from inner-city schools in                 Memphis, Tennessee.                                                                                                                                             The project also includes a five-day workshop in probability                    and statistics sponsored by the Memphis Urban Mathematics                       Collaborative and a two-day curriculum review workshop.                                                                                                         LeMoyne-Owen College and the Memphis Urban Mathematics                          Collaborative are contributing as cost-sharing an amount equal                  to 8% of the NSF award.",
