Richey                   in the Chemistry Department at Pennsylvania State University                    will investigate the structures and reactions of new                            organometallic species of main-group elements.  The study will                  also involve preparation of new organometallics and generating                  a new species of more reactive organomagnesium compounds.                                                                                                       This project will be concerned with the preparation and study                   of species formed from organomagnesium compounds by additions                   of crown ethers or simple salts, such as alkali metal alkoxides                 and tetraalkylammonium halides.  These new species, which                       include coordinated organomagnesium cations, threaded                           organomagnesium-crown ethers, and various organomagnesiate                      anions, are considerably more reactive than conventional                        organomagnesium compounds, and with some substrates afford                      different products.  The scope  and mechanisms of their                         reactions with ketones and other reactions will be studied.                     Similar investigations of organozincate anions formed from                      organozinc compounds and salts will also be performed.",
