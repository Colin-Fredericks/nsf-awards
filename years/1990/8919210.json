 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is currently considerable interest in understanding the                   structure, electronic properties, and reactivity of metals and                  semiconductors since these materials figure prominently in many                 important technological areas including microelectronics and                    catalysis.  To understand the macroscopic behavior of such                      systems requires knowledge of the structural and electronic                     properties at the molecular level.  The overall objective of this               study is to characterize with atomic resolution the structural                  and electronic properties of low-dimensional materials that                     exhibit interesting structural, electrical, and catalytic                       behavior.  A the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) will be used               to probe these key properties directly in real-space.  Specific                 materials that will be investigated with the STM include tantalum               disulfide/ diselenide, chemically-modified tantalum disulfide                   (i.e., metal-substituted, anion-substituted, and intercalated                   materials), and graphite intercalation complexes.  Emphasis will                be placed on characterizing in detail the structure and                         electronic properties of the charge density wave (CDW) phases in                the metal dichalcogenide materials and on correlating changes in                the CDW phases with the chemical modifications.  The studies                    will provide systematic atomic-resolution data that will be                     compared with theoretical models to develop a better microscopic                understanding of the structural and electronic properties of                    these interesting low-dimensional materials, and to understand                  how these properties can be varied through chemical modification.               This award is jointly funded by the Solid-State Chemistry Program               of the Division of Materials Research, and by the Analytical and                Surface Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division.",
