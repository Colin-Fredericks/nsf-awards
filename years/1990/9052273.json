 "awd_abstract_narration": "The department of chemistry was without an adequately functioning               U. V.-visible spectrophotometer and so basic but fundamentally                  important laboratory experiments could not be performed.  The                   acquisition of a spectrophotometer with a computer work station                 increased the teaching effectiveness of the department's                        inorganic and biochemistry laboratory courses and at the same                   time, modernized the labs.  The instrument is used to teach the                 relationship between U. V.-visible spectra and chemical                         processes.  The computer is used in the acquisition and storage                 of data, and in fitting the data to various models.  The                        instrument is extensively used in the biochemistry course where                 it is a powerful tool in the study of macromolecule.  In fact,                  the instrument allowed development of a two semester biochemistry               laboratory that emphasizes isolation and characterization of                    proteins and nucleic acids.  The spectrophotometer also is used                 in undergraduate research projects.  Student research is an                     important part of the chemistry curriculum at the institution and               several research problems are being undertaken which could not be               carried out previously.                                                                                                                                         The institution is contributing to the project in an amount equal               to the NSF funds.",
