 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research computer laboratory is being developed in the Psychology             Department to facilitate the teaching of experimental methods via the           execution and analysis of original student research projects. The lab           thus facilitates an experiential approach to learning research                  methodology, including problem conceptualization, experimental design,          research methodology including problem conceptualization, experimental          design, research execution, data analysis, and report writing. A                standardized set of software tools, used throughout the four-course             research sequence, helps to provide continuity to the research                  curriculum. The computer lab also helps demonstrate the steps in                hypothesis testing, simulate classic experimental designs, and test             students' ability to critically evaluate specific experimental designs.         The computing laboratory, with a network of 11 PC computers and                 associated peripherals, thus gives students an experiential                     understanding of empirical methods via an integrated, cumulative                research sequence. The university will contribute an amount equal to            the award.",
