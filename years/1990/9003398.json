 "awd_abstract_narration": "Syringomycin is a peptide phytotoxin produced by the bacterium,                 Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae.  The toxin is a major                        virulence factor in many plant and crop diseases.  Previous work                supported by NSF showed that syringomycin's primary site of                     action is the host plasma membrane.  Several plasma membrane-                   associated events caused by syringomycin were demonstrated                      including changes in K+ efflux, Ca2+ influx, H+-pump ATPase                     activity, membrane charge potential, and protein phosphorylation.               Also, the structure of syringomycin was determined.  Further                    studies on the mechanism of action of the syringomycin are being                pursued.  The studies exploit the action of the toxin on the                    yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  Preliminary studies revealed                   that syringomycin affects S. cerevisiae in ways which resemble                  its effects on plant plasma membranes.  Syringomycin-resistant,                 temperature-sensitive mutants are being isolated and                            characterized.  The normal versions of the defective genes are                  being isolated by gene complementation techniques and                           characterized.  These genes encode proteins that function in the                syringomycin response pathway.  Revertants with second-site                     suppressor mutations are being studied to determine how the                     identified gene products interact in the syringomycin response                  pathway.                                                                                                                                                        This project is significant because it determines how an                        important, ubiquitous bacterial phytotoxin causes plant disease                 and provides basic information about the function, structure and                regulation of the plant cell plasma membrane.",
