 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student Pugwash USA is an organization that is devoted to                       increasing awareness among graduate and undergraduate students on               ethical issues posed by science and advancing technology.  Programs             are international, intergenerational, and interdisciplinary, and                include the organization of biennial conferences and the                        development and integration of a campus-based chapter network, to               build a growing community of individuals who bring to their work                a lasting commitment to responsible decision making.  This award                will provide support for student participants to attend the Seventh             Biennial Conference and for chapter and regional development                    activities.  The conference allows approximately 90 U.S. and                    foreign students to spend a week with about 40 experts and leaders              in science, government, academia and business in small group and                plenary sessions exploring the social and ethical implications of               environmental, scientific and technological change.  Conference                 research papers and plenary speeches are often published in                     professional journals.  This year's conference theme is \"New Ways               of Thinking:  Ethical Issues in Science and World Affairs.\"                     Chapter development activities include local and regional                       conferences, a national Chapter Organizing Workshop and Chapter                 Meeting and Conference, the revision of chapter relevant                        publications, and the development of an electronic campus-based                 student network.  NSF support provides approximately 15% of the                 costs of these activities.  This support assists Student Pugwash                USA to raise additional funds from private sector donors.                                                                                                       This proposal comes from an organization with a track record of                 successful and innovative activities to increase students'                      awareness of the links between science, technology and society.                 The project director is very competent; the project plan,                       appropriate.  NSF support will allow the conference and chapter                 programs to continue as the organization develops its plans for                 long term financial stability.  An award is highly recommended.",
