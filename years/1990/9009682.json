 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will examine the rearrangement of synapses                     (\"synapse elimination\") occurring in neonatal rat muscle.  The                  long-term goal is to understand the qualitative and quantitative                roles of this rearrangement in generating the adult innervation.                The project has two specific aims.  1) To ascertain how single                  motor neurons distribute their synapses to the types of fibers                  present at the time of birth.  Intracellular dye injection will                 be used to mark fibers innervated by a single motor neuron; the                 types of these fibers will be determined using antibodies                       directed against myosin heavy chain isoforms.  These results will               reveal whether synaptic rearrangement generates the selective                   innervation of fiber types found to exist a week following birth                or whether these connections are already selective at birth.  An                examination of the innervation of fiber types during the early                  stages of reinnervation of neonatal muscle is also proposed in                  order to determine whether the final selective pattern seen in                  these muscles is the result of synaptic rearrangement.  2) To                   determine whether slow and fast motor neurons innervate the same                fibers during embryonic developments.  The fast fibers which are                present in the neonatal soleus muscles are not generated until                  after the 20th day of gestation.  Thus at this time, fast motor                 neurons must either be innervating slow fibers or alternatively                 awaiting the generation of fast fibers before they begin                        synaptogenesis.  These alternatives will be distinguished by                    determining the number of motor neurons innervating soleus on the               20th day of gestation.",
