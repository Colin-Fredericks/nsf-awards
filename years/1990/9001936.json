 "awd_abstract_narration": "The best current programs for two-person perfect information                    games play only a single game; they search exhaustively and they                do not learn.  The goals of this project are to demonstrate                     further the viability of a weak theory as a search paradigm and                 to facilitate the construction of computers that learn entire                   categories of tasks, rather than requiring individualized                       instruction.  This research develops a program, HOYLE, that can                 play any such game correctly and, with experience, can learn to                 play it extremely well.  Instead of extensive search, HOYLE                     learns a search control strategy for each new game under the                    guidance of its weak domain theory:  a combination of procedural                knowledge about game playing, declarative knowledge about                       specific games, a language and framework for strategic elements,                and a set of narrow but expert perspectives called Advisors.  As                it plays a new game, HOYLE selectively constructs, organizes, and               reformulates a knowledge base for each game from its playing                    experience.  Under a novel architecture that employs a variety of               control strategies for move selection, HOYLE combines that                      knowledge base with its Advisors to produce a coherentr,                        incisive, steadily improving strategy for the game.  A prototype                of this multifaceted learning has proved itself remarkably                      effective in a varied but limited domain.  HOYLE addresses, both                in its design and in its implementation, important questions in                 theory formation, collaboratin of experts, conflict resolution,                 experimental design, and operationalization.",
