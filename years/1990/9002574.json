 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research in arithmetic algebraic                   geometry of Professor Ching-Li Chai of the University of                        Pennsylvania. Dr. Chai has proposed to work on two projects: the                first is to investigate level structures over extraordinary                     primes, and the second is to construct rigid homogeneous spaces.                Both of these projects are related to the arithmetic of                         automorphic forms and Shimura varieties.                                             This is research in the field of arithmetic algebraic                      geometry, a subject that combines the techniques of algebraic                   geometry and number theory. In its original formulation,                        algebraic geometry treated figures that could be defined in the                 plane by the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Number                     theory started with the whole numbers and such questions as                     divisibility of one whole number by another. These two subjects,                seemingly so far apart, have in fact influenced each other from                 the earliest times, but in the past quarter century the mutual                  influence has increased greatly. The field of arithmetic                        algebraic geometry now uses techniques from all of modern                       mathematics, and is having corresponding influence beyond its own               borders.",
