 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study inference in simultaneous nonlinear                     error-in-variables models - identification, estimation,                         prediction and specification testing. The linkages between                      identifiability and nonlinearities in the measurement error model               will be studied and appropriate sufficient identifiability                      conditions analyzed. The consequences of measurement errors on                  standard procedures for testing hypotheses, estimation and                      validation in nonlinear models will be studied. Parametric and                  semiparametric procedures are established for the estimation of                 nonlinear error-in-variables models. Modifications of Monte Carlo               and residual-based stochastic simulations are developed to handle               measurement error problems and adapted to not only prediction but               also estimation and specification testing. The large-sample                     asymptotic theory for these procedures will be developed.                                                                                                       Particular attention is given to the treatment of the measurement               error generating process. The standard Gaussian white nose model                for measurement errors is the starting point for the analysis.                  Analysis then continues to less restrictive and more appropriate                measurement error models which are nonlinear and non-Gaussian.                  Simultaneous systems with limited dependent variables are used                  for a more specific examination of the applicability of the new                 techniques.",
