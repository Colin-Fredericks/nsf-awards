 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using methods recently developed in econometrics and mathematical               statistics, this project will investigate the theory of                         \"learning\" in a class of \"artificial neural network\" models.                    Models are to be developed that will yield potentially more                     efficient and powerful estimation and testing procedures.                                                                                                       The research falls into four interrelated ares: large-sample                    properties of nonparametric estimation procedures based on neural               network models, relative computational properties of different                  methods for optimizing the network learning (estimation)                        objective function, application of nonparametric network-based                  procedures to construct semi-parametric estimators and perform                  specification tests, and comparison of network-based procedures                 to standard nonparametric and semi-parametric procedures based on               kernel estimators and series estimators, among others.                                                                                                          The techniques developed in this field have been successfully                   used to forecast in engineering and technology. Some specific                   applications have included various industrial settings and in                   defense to accomplish tasks that had been insoluble. Some                       examples include bomb detection in airports, distinguishing                     between sonar signals generated from rocks and mines, vibration                 damping in machinery, handwriting character recognition and robot               coordination and control. Further work in this area should                      continue to expand the fields of applications beyond economics.",
