This conference is                 being organized by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers                 (ASME) together with the Institute of Electrical and Electronic                 Engineer (IEEE) and the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).                The purpose of MI 1990 is to provide an international forum for                 the presentation and exchange of information, experience, and                   concerns dealing with the modern manufacturing enterprise.  The                 purpose of the project will be accomplished by awarding a                       monetary honorarium to invited international participants to help               defray a portion of their travel cost to the conference and                     living expenses while in attendance.  This international                        participation is both necessary and vital to the success of such                a conference because modern manufacturing and its goal of                       successful product competition in the world marketplace has                     evolved into a global enterprise.",
