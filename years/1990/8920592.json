 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite numerous biomechanical investigations, the                         functional significance of the size and shape of the primate                    mandible remains obscure.  The reason for this is not that the                  theoretical basis of biomechanical investigation is lacking, but                that the limiting factor in previous studies has been in the                    choice of the models employed to demonstrate the mechanical                     behavior of the jaw.  Nevertheless, past investigations have                    established that there is a relationship between mandibular form,               masticatory stress, and diet in primates.  The precise nature of                this relationship, however, has yet to be elucidated.  Analysis                 of cross-sectional morphology of hominoid jaws by computed                      tomography (CAT-scans) has revealed that the nature and extent of               variation in the mechanical properties of the mandible cannot be                known by consideration of external measurements alone.                               This study will use computed tomography to explore how                     compact bone distribution within the mandible contributes to its                structural rigidity.  The proposed research represents an                       important step in documenting the functional significance of size               and shape variation in higher primate mandibles.  Having                        established this relationship, this method may be applied to the                fossil record, in order to infer directly the biomechanics of                   fossil jaws.  In addition, the data will provide an independent                 line of evidence which may help to clarify the persistent debate                over the nature of the diet in the fossil australopithecines.",
