 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project                 between Professor Alexander Rich, Department of Biology,                        Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Professor Yoshimasa                  Kyogoku, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Japan.               The investigators are collaborating in a study of the three-                    dimensional molecular structure of certain protein-DNA complexes.               One complex to be studied will involve the DNA binding portion of               the yeast protein gal 4 bound to DNA.  The work should shed light               on the manner in which the protein recognizes the DNA sequence of               its recognition element.  This structure is of interest because it              incorporates a so-called zinc finger motif, a feature found in a                large number of proteins that bind to DNA, and believed to be an                important element in DNA-protein recognition.  A second protein to              be studied is a leucine zipper protein, nuclear factor AP-1, bound              to DNA.  In both efforts, engineered versions of the DNA binding                protein will be synthesized by the Osaka group and the DNA binding              elements will be synthesized at MIT.  Protein will be mailed to                 MIT where co-crystallization experiments will be carried out and                an x-ray diffraction analysis of the protein-DNA complex completed.             Complementary solution NMR studies of both the protein and its                  complex will be carried out in Osaka.  The study should thus                    yield information on the range of conformations that the protein-               DNA system can undergo, and more generally illuminate the important             question of the identity or non-identity of biological systems in               crystalline and solution form.                                                                                                                                  There is an excellent prospect that this research will lead to a                significant contribution to scientific knowledge.  The U.S.                     principal investigator is a highly respected, productive molecular              biologist, whose laboratory is one of the top ones in the world                 for x-ray crystallographic and other structural studies of                      biological molecules.  The Japanese researcher with whom he will                cooperate is also an expert in his field.  The proposed projects                are on the forefront of science and of fundamental importance in                understanding the transmission of genetic information and the                   continuity of viability of an organismal strain.",
