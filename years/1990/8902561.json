 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chlorosis-inducing phytotoxin coronatine has an unusual                     structure and consists of a polyketide component joined to an                   ethylcyclopropyl ring.  In contrast to other phytotoxins produced               by Pseudomonas syringae, coronatine is produced by multiple                     pathovars with distinct host specificity.  Despite the importance               of coronatine in the virulence of producing pathovars the                       genetics of coronatine biosynthesis has not been systematically                 studied.  Transposon mutagenesis was used to generate coronatine-               defective mutants of P. syringae pv. tomato.  The physical                      analysis of these mutants suggested the involvement of a 101 kb                 plasmid (designated pPT23A) in coronatine synthesis.  pPT23A was                subsequently transferred into P. syringae pv. syringae PS61, a                  nonproducer of coronatine.  Upon acquisition of pPT23A, PS61                    gained the ability to make coronatine.  Therefore, conclusive                   evidence has been collected for the involvement of plasmid                      pPT23A in production of coronatine.  The experiments outlined in                this proposal will precisely define the regions of pPT23A                       involved in coronatine biosynthesis by moleuclar cloning,                       mutagenesis, and complementation experiments. The results of                    these proposed experiments will advance knowledge in the area of                phytotoxin genetics.",
