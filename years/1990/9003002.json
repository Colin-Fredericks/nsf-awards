 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last few years, there has been an increased interest in                  the study of multilevel preconditioners for solving elliptic                    problems in conjunction with the conjugate gradient method.  Part               of the motivation is that these methods are highly                              parallelizable, in addition to usually possessing good                          convergence properties, a combination that most of the classical                preconditioners (e.g. SSOR, incomplete factorizations and                       polynomial preconditioners) lack.  The authors' previous work in                this area has convinced them that this is a very promising                      approach for constructing efficient and robust iterative methods                for solving large elliptic difference equations on massively                    parallel computers.  Continued research in this area, will                      include a careful study of implementation issues for massively                  parallel computers such as the CM.2, a theoretical study of the                 relationships among different multilevel preconditioners and the                class of domain decomposition methods, hybrid multilevel methods                which retain the nice properties of incomplete factorization                    methods with respect to non.smooth coefficients, and extensions                 beyond self-adjoint second order elliptic operators                             (e.g.indefinite, convection-diffusion and biharmonic operators.)",
