 "awd_abstract_narration": "The peccaries (Artiodactyla:  Tayassuidae) are a family of                 ungulates with extreme specializations of the nasal passages.  In               particular, their noses contain a complex of inflated bony                      structures found nowhere else among the mammals.  The functions                 of these structures are completely unknown.  One difficulty in                  arriving at a functional interpretation is that little is known                 about the functional morphology of the vertebrate respiratory                   system.  The proposed research is both a systematic investigation               of possible functions of the peccary nasal apparatus and general                analysis of mammalian respiratory mechanics.  The principal                     investigators will test the hypothesis that the peccary                         structures are involved in olfaction by histological and                        ultrastructural study of the nasal epithelia.  They will assess                 whether the structures function as part of a brain-cooling                      mechanism by elucidating the anatomy of the nasal vasculature.                  They will use mathematical modeling and an experimental flow                    apparatus to test whether the structures are associated with a                  mechanism for exchanging heat or water with the environment, and                also to investigate if they could be used to remove particles                   from a dust-laden atmosphere.",
