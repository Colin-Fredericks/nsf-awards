 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to establish a U.S. national panel on                           structural control research for seismic and wind resistant                      design.  The objective is to establish a sound knowledge                        basis for research, to develop a national R&D program for the                   active control of structures, and to conduct a collaborative                    planning study project with a counterpart panel in Japan                        established by the Japan Science Agency.                                                                                                                        A plan of action will be developed which consists of possible                   multi-national efforts involving collaborative projects,                        exchange of personnel, jointly organized experiments, and                       exchange of data and technical information, etc.  The                           activities will involve researchers from academic field,                        industry, and government laboratories.  The programs will be                    carried out under the general auspices of the International                     Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR).                                                                                                                  The effort will bring about accelerated implementation of an                    emerging technology in active structural control which holds                    great promise for reducing structural damages for seismic and                   wind loadings.",
