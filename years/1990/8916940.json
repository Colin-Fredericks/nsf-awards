 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will finish collecting and will analyze a                     superb sequence of middle Pleistocene fossil-mammal faunas from                 Porcupine Cave, located high in the Colorado Rocky Mountains.                   The fossils and other relevant data will be used to: (1) Identify               how high-elevation (2900 m) mammalian communities were                          reorganized through glacial-interglacial transitions between -                  400,000 and 800,000 years ago.  (2) Quantify, through                           computerized imaging and statistical techniques, the climatic                   signal contained in the biogeographic distribution and spatial                  morphologic variation of selected extant species that also are                  present in the fossil faunas.  (3) Test five hypotheses about the               interaction between climate and mammalian communities.  The                     hypotheses are formulated especially to test whether changes in                 seasonality are important in triggering major community                         reorganizations, which is the cornerstone of the coevolutionary                 disequilibrium model.   Testing the hypotheses will rely on                     comparing the faunal data with independent predictors of past                   climate, notably oxygen- and carbon-isotope curves (and their                   attendant implications for global ice volume, temperature, and                  CO2 levels) and model-generated estimates of seasonality and                    other climatic parameters.                                                           This research is important in identifying how oscillations                 in specific climatic parameters provoke changes in mammal                       communities in the absence of human impact.  Such information                   currently is unavailable -- human influence cannot be ruled out                 of even late Pleistocene commu n  ity changes -- and will be                       extremely useful in predicting what might happen to modern                      \"protected\" ecosystems over tens to hundreds of years.                               Additional significance lies in (1) providing an                           exceptionally rich sample of the fossil fauna for a time and                    place where little is known, which in turn yields paleoecologic,                evolutionary, and paleoclimatic insights; and (2) refining and                  developing quantitative techniques for extracting the climatic                  signal from biogeographic ranges and morphologic variation of                   mammal species that are present in numerous fossil sites of the                 American West.",
