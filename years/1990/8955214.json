 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project will provide an intensive five-week                     summer educational program in Marine Sciences for middle                        through high school science teachers involved in teacher                        training and workshops in their home states.  The program is                    designed to provide teachers with a general knowledge of                        Marine Sciences, ideas for field and lab work that they can                     implement in their classrooms and teach others and, most                        importantly, a practical experience of working and living at                    sea.  The shore-based, three-week component will be held in                     Woods Hole and will consist of an intensive fifty hour course                   of lectures, labs, workshops, and field trips in Marine                         Sciences.  This course will emphasize the basic concepts in                     physics, chemistry, geology, and biology that can be conveyed                   to students through studies of the ocean, and will be                           directed towards development of curricula to be implemented                     in the classrooms of these teachers.  In addition, two short                    lecture series -- one entitled \"The United States and the                       Sea\" and the other on various topics in Nautical Science --                     will be presented to enhance the subsequent experience that                     the teachers will have at sea.  This final two weeks will                       then be spent on board a fully equipped oceanographic sailing                   research vessel where the practical hands-on experience of                      carrying out a research project and participating in the                        operation of one of the few remaining \"tall ships\" that                         practice marine research.  This extraordinary experience will                   expand the participants scientific knowledge base, help them                    to understand current methodology of scientific research, and                   revitalize their teaching.                                                                                                                                      The cost sharing will be sixteen percent of the NSF portion.",
