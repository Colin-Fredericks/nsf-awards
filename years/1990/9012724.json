 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many stream channels have been modified significantly in the last          century.  Dams, levees, revetments, meander cut-offs, and reservoirs            have been constructed to control floods and to improve navigation.              These modifications have severely altered the morphology of the                 channels and have changed the patterns of erosion and sedimentation.            The exact character of these changes is not well documented, however.           Among the most drastically modified streams is the lower Mississippi            River.  This project will use historic hydrographic survey maps to              measure changes in channel morphology and sediment regimes on the lower         Mississippi over the last century.  The data gathered in this project           will also be used to analyze the degree to which human versus natural           forces have altered flows and depositional patterns, and they will              provide a basis for more detailed examination of the processes of               meandering in large streams.                                                         This project will yield useful results at a number of levels.  It          will provide a data set specific to the lower Mississippi River.  These         data will be valuable aids to scholars studying this stream and to              practitioners who must deal directly with flood control and navigation          systems.  The conclusions drawn in this project will also have broader          significance, offering new insights into the processes by which stream          flow and sediment transport respond to modification by humans and to            changes in natural conditions.",
