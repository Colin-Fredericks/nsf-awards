 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the interpenetration of science,                        education, and entertainment in the study and promotion of                      animal behavior research by Gladwyn Kingsley Noble and William                  Douglas Burden at the American Museum of Natural History from                   roughly 1928 to 1950.  Adept entrepreneurs, both Noble and                      Burden recognized the importance of film in behavior research                   and its significance as a medium for educational and                            promotional purposes.  The development of film represented an                   important technological breakthrough in the study of behavior,                  for the biologist could now isolate animal motion and behavior                  on a medium that could be studied and manipulated at will.                      Natural history films, however, served a dual function, for                     these films could be shown to the public as education and                       entertainment, a marketing strategy that Noble and Burden                       employed in promoting their Department of Experimental                          Biology, founded at the American Museum n 1928.  The interplay                  of science and entertainment in the careers of Noble and                        Burden reached its culmination in the late thirties with the                    establishment of Marineland, the first multi-species                            oceanarium of its kind, 18 miles south of St. Augustine,                        Florida.  Serving as a research center, entertainment park and                  film studio, Marineland represented a new approach to selling                   science in 20th century American culture fed on mass media.                     The object of study was also an important tool in generating                    mass appeal.  Capitalizing on the popular image of the dolphin                  as a \"friend to gods, children, and men,\"  Marineland                           cultivated the dolphin itself as a marketing ploy.  As a case                   study, this project bears directly on the history of animal                     behavior studies in America and on issues regarding the use                     of mass media in the popularization of science within 20th                      century American culture.",
