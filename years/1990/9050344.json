 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project, sponsored by Howard University,                        provides for an effective two-year in-service teacher                           training program followed by an evaluation and follow-up in                     the third year.  The project will involve 60 middle school                      mathematics teachers in grades 7-8 in eleven middle schools                     in the D.C. public school system.  Teachers will be selected                    from those schools where the students' standardized test                        performances fall below the grade level average of the                          Washington D.C. area.  The project involves professional                        staffs from Howard University, the  American Association for                    the Advancement of Science, the Alliance Computer Systems                       Corporation, the University of the District of Columbia, the                    D.C. Public School Systems and the Washington Urban League.                     The principal activities in this teacher program will include                   the following:  hands-on training with materials evaluated                      and approved by the National Council of Teachers in                             Mathematics (NCTM), as well as materials from the Middle                        Grade Mathematics Project, the Lawrence Hall of Science and                     AAAS; intensive workshops in basic mathematics (algebra,                        geometry and statistics); simulation and graphics experience                    using supercomputers and sophisticated workstations; use of                     college student assistance during the academic school year in                   the teachers' classrooms; supervises teaching experience with                   experts in various fields of mathematics who will also be                       serving as collaborators; workshops with parents and                            administrators in the schools; provisions of day-care                           facilities for teachers with dependent children during the                      summer workshop; and extensive evaluation not only of the                       program but of student achievement.  The NSF share of the                       cost of the project is $626,322 which is being matched by                       $336,000 from Howard University, the District of Columbia                       Public Schools and local business and industry.  This is a                      match of about 54%.",
