 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two.year collaborative research project                               between Robert P. Gilbert of the University of                                  Delaware and four Chinese mathematicians from                                   Beijing University, Fudan University in Shanghai,                               and Zhongshan University in Guangzhou.  The project                             is sponsored by NSF and the Chinese National                                    Natural Science Foundation.                                                                                                                                     Partial differential equations are the means by                                 which many problems in the physical sciences and                                engineering are described.  Progress in these                                   applied fields is dependent to a large degree on                                progress in the development of methods for solving                              partial differential equations and the numerical                                implementation of these methods.  Two current areas                             where this interrelation is most apparent is in the                             area of injection molding and the design of                                     composite shells.  The injective molding procedure                              may be described by a Hele.Shaw flow, which in turn                             is what mathematicians refer to as an \"elliptic                                 moving boundary problem.\"  The composite elastic                                shells are described by an elliptic system of                                   equations.                                                                                                                                                      The goal of this collaborative project is to reach                              a better understanding of these problems, using                                 \"function theoretic\" methods and their numerical                                implementation.  The Chinese collaborating                                      scientists, who are especially strong in this field                             are:  Wen Guochun from Beijing University, Xu                                   Zhenyuan and Hou Zongyi from Fudan, and Lin Wei                                 from Zhongshan.  Each of these scientists will                                  spend a few months working with Professor Gilbert                               and his research group at the University of Delaware.",
