 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI identifies five persistent problems in dealing with                 categorical data analysis, and proposes new approaches to solve                 them.  Because much of social science data is categorical (such                 as race, gender, party membership, employed/unemployed, and state               of hypothetical latent structure models) instances of the prob-                 lems appear in all the social sciences.  Most statistics assume                 continuous variables, though it is known that violating that                    assumption can lead to erroneous conclusions for categorical                    data.  Theoretical constructs, such as those in Markov models,                  which appear widely in social science theories also often use                   categorical 'data,' or discrete states.  Thus these problems                    affect everyday data analysis problems faced by most social                     sciences researchers.  PI proposes to attack the five problems                  identified, and moreover, to do so in a way which minimizes                     assumptions about the distributions of the data (parametric                     assumptions).  Success with any of the five problems promises a                 significant improvement in data analysis and theory building for                the majority of practicing sociologists.",
