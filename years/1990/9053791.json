 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year project will double or triple the time spent on                   science and mathematics by elementary students in Marshall                      County, West Virginia.  The Science and Mathematics Education                   Enhancement Council (SciMEEC), an incorporated group of                         citizens, parents, teachers, and scientists, is collaborating                   with 12 public and 4 private schools in the county to develop 32                weekly after-school hands-on science and mathematics experiences                for children in each grade, K through 6, whose parents wish to                  enroll them.  Each of the seven levels will build upon those                    which have come before but will also be sufficiently self-                      contained to permit students to enter at any grade level.  Two                  parents whose children are enrolled will be recruited and                       trained to serve as volunteer assistants for each of the school                 teachers who are involved in the project.  Additional support is                being provided by the corporate sector in both cash and in-kind                 contributions.  At the end of NSF support the project will be a                 self-sustaining program through contributions from the corporate                sector and fees from participants.",
