 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Theoretical Intermediate Energy (Nuclear/Particle)                          Physics Group was established in 1987 through a Research                        Improvement in Minority Institutions (RIMI) grant from the                      National Science Foundation (NSF).  The grant period will                       end in the summer of 1990.  Funds are sought for the                            continuation of this group; however, now the structure                          will include nuclear experimentalists and will be known as                      the Nuclear Physics Group of which the theory group is a                        part.  The Nuclear Physics Group will serve as an umbrella                      for both theory and experimental Intermediate (Medium)                          Energy physics grant support from all funding sources.                          This structure will eventually lead to application for a                        NSF Minority Center of Excellence grant, for example.                           Funds to support one Research Assistant Professor, one                          graduate student, one part time Nuclear Physics Group                           Administrative Assistant (the other part of this salary                         has been included in an NSF nuclear experimental proposal                       submitted through Hampton University), and the Principal                        Investigator are requested.",
