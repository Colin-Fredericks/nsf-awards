 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between sedimentary process and                           stratigraphic response is still poorly understood.  As a result,                the origin of stratigraphic parasequences, the fundamental                      building block of most sedimentary basins, is still highly                      controversial.                                                                       We will examine the parasequences of the lower to Middle                   Cambrian Carrara Formation, a larger-scale sequence which ranges                laterally from shallow marine carbonate to shallow marine (and                  possibly alluvial) siliciclastic sediments.  We will: 1) identify               and correlate parasequences within the Carrara Formation and its                equivalents; 2) Characterize surfaces that bound parasequences                  for information useful in determining the mode(s) of parasequence               initiation and termination; 3) Map specific facies within                       established parasequences to obtain information on their                        thickness, geometry, and spatial distribution; 4) Describe and                  interpret specific facies within parasequences to provide                       information on the processes of sediment production and                         dispersal, water depths, paleoclimate, and more local                           paleogeography.                                                                      If the diversity and geometry of facies within parasequences               are delineated, then the mechanisms responsible for their                       formation can be more accurately determined and, where possible,                quantified.  This information could greatly refine models for                   paleogeography, water depths, sea-level history, subsidence                     history, paleoclimate, and local or regional tectonic events.",
