 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is the chemistry of compounds                  of main-group elements in aqueous solution. Main-group elements                 include sulfur, oxygen, chlorine, nitrogen and selenium, and                    the reactions of main-group compounds are involved in a variety                 of processes of great ecomomic and social importance, ranging                   from something as mundane as the action of chlorine bleach to                   the environmentally important formation of acid rain.                                                                                                           The primary focus of this project is the oxidation and                          reduction of main-group compounds, especially through free                      radical intermediates. One set of reactions will use                            substitution-inert coordination compounds as the reaction                       partners, which will have the advantage of relatively                           predictable reaction mechanisms. Oxidation of sulfite by a                      Ru(III) complex will be used to estimate the standard redox                     potential of the sulfite radical, and is expected to                            demonstrate the novel process of free-radical sulfonation. This                 and studies with related complexes will be used to elucidate                    the factors affecting electron transfer at pyramidal molecules.                 Oxidation of NO by a Ni(III) complex will be studied to provide                 insight on the obscure phenomenon of nuclear tunneling. Nuclear                 tunneling will be probed further in studies of the outer-sphere                 reduction of BrCN and through kinetic isotope effects in the                    oxidations of nitrite ion and NO. The other class of reactions                  to be investigated is redox reactions between main-group                        molecules. The self-exchange rate for the dioxygen/superoxide                   couple will be measured directly. Other reactions in this class                 will probe the hypothesis that electron transfer between                        main-group species invariably proceeds with rates much greater                  than predicted by Marcus theory.",
