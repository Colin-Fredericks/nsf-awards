 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global atmospheric CO2 levels are rising, and current                      levels may double by the latter half of the 21st century.                       Elevated CO2 is known to alter plant physiology and growth, but                 very little research has addressed the consequences of elevated                 CO2 for the ecological interactions of plants.  A couple of                     studies have documented significant effects of CO2 on                           interactions between herbaceous plants and insects, but nothing                 is known about effects of CO2 on interactions between trees and                 tree-feeding insects.  The purpose of this research is to                       investigate the effects of enriched CO2 atmospheres on                          interactions between deciduous trees and tree-feeding insects, as               mediated by changes in tree chemical composition.  The model                    system will consist of quaking aspen, red oak and maple (fast-,                 intermediate- slow-growing species, respectively) and two leaf-                 feeding insects, the gypsy moth and forest tent caterpillar.                    Resource availability theory is used as a framework for                         development of three primary goals and associated hypotheses.                   The three goals of this research are to:  1) determine the                      effects of elevated CO2 on tree chemical composition, and                       consequences for performance (survival, growth, food use                        efficiencies) of insects, 2) investigate the interactive effects                of elevated CO2 and soil nutrient availability on tree chemical                 composition and insect performance, and 3) determine the                        interactive effects of elevated CO2 and defoliation on tree                     chemical composition and insect performance.  Trees will be grown               under several concentrations of CO2 in environmental control                    rooms at the University of Wisconsin Biotron, and subjected to                  chemical assays and bioassays.  Significant features of this                    research include its focus on CO2-mediated effects on                           interactions between forest trees and their defoliators, an                     emphasis on effects of CO2 on plant chemical composition, an                    emphasis on interactive effects between CO2 and their                           environmental \"stresses\" on plant-insect interactions, and use of               three tree species and two insect species that are ecologically                 and economically important components of North American deciduous               forest.",
