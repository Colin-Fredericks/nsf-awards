 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are the electrochemical                    effects exerted on atmospheric ice particles by aerosols and                    gases.  Of primary interest are compounds of carbon, nitrogen,                  and sulfur common in the troposphere.  Their effects can                        influence electrical atmospheric processes (thunderstorms).  They               also leave their imprint on the paleoclimatic record conserved in               glaciers and polar ice caps.  Laboratory measurements of solute                 partition between ice and water will yield data on mechanisms by                which environmental species are removed from the atmosphere.                    Electrical measurements on laboratory-grown ice specimens will                  relate impurity effects to diagnostic parameters that may be used               in quantifying electrical conduction and in analyzing ice-core                  logging curves.  Of special concern is the nature of surface                    conduction in ice and how it is affected by specific impurities.                The photochemical creation of surface carriers will be probed by                illumination of the sample with near-uv or visible light while                  electrical measurements are in progress.//",
