 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together the needs of local physics                         teachers, a local resource (Bates Linear Accelerator Center)                    with an international reputation, master teachers and                           research scientists.  In Phase I the Project Director,                          Dr. Ernst Moniz will outline a teaching manual focused on                       modern particle and nuclear physics.  Working from the                          outline three master teachers and the Program Coordinator                       will put together a lecture series program to be delivered by                   research scientists from the Bates Laboratory.  Phase II is                     the lecture series delivered between September 1990 and                         December 1990.  Phase III is to refine the teaching manual                      using participant feedback followed by its distribution to                      teachers.                                                                                                                                                       The core of this project is the teaching manual and its use                     in the in-service sessions.  Because of the lack of current                     material in high school texts regarding modern particle and                     nuclear physics the first section will contain modern                           particle and nuclear physics teaching topic \"work-ups.\"  In                     addition to background content, it will contain classroom                       demonstrations which have been tested and are written in a                      form useable for teachers.  A second section will consist of                    brief biographies of physicists including minorities and                        women.  The intent is to provide role models for students.                      The third  section  will be a bibliography of textbooks,                        \"popular physics books\", young adult book and other resource                    books.  Following the Fermilab model it will be a three-ring                    loose leaf manual so it is a \"living\" body of work.  The                        early draft of the manual will be the template for the                          lecture series.  The revised manual will also be a valuable                     resource for Boston area teachers planning a field trip to                      the Bates Laboratory.                                                                                                                                           Project participants will be high school teachers from public                   and private schools in the area served by the North Shore                       Physics Teachers Association, from southern New Hampshire to                    Boston.  The project provides opportunities for three-master                    teachers and 20 additional teachers via the lecture series.                     The master teachers may earn 5 quarter hours graduate credit                    and underprepared teachers 4 quarter hours graduate credit.                                                                                                     Cost sharing in an amount of $16,000 equals 26% of the NSF                      award.",
