 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jack H. Freed is supported by a grant from the Experimental                 Physical Chemistry Program to study molecular relaxation by                     electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. These studies                       provide valuable insight into the mechanisms of molecular                       motion and also into the rapidly emerging medical area of                       magnetic imaging of the human body.                                                                                                                             A variety of newly developed ESR relaxation techniques are to                   be employed, and the necessary theoretical frameworks for                       understanding these experiments are also to be developed and                    extended. Specific projects include the following: (1) the                      further applications of the new two-dimensional                                 Fourier-Transform electron-electron double resonance (2D-ELDOR)                 technique to the study of rotational molecular dynamics in                      liquids; (2) the extension of 2D-ELDOR to the slow motional                     regime; (3) the application of field-swept 2D-electron spin                     echo techniques and slow-motional 2D-ELDOR to the study of                      viscous liquids and glasses; (4) studies of molecular dynamics                  on surfaces by 2D-ESR methods; (5) comparisons of microscopic                   vs. macroscopic diffusion in complex liquids utilizing the                      method of dynamic imaging of diffusion (DID) - ESR for                          measurement of macroscopic translational diffusion and 2D-ELDOR                 for microscopic translational diffusion; (6) applications of                    far-infrared ESR to the study of molecular dynamics.",
