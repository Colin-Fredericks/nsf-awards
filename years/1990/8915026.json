The topic of the                      seminar is \"Pesticides and the Future -- Toxicological Studies of               Risks and Benefits.\"  The organizers are Professor Ernest                       Hodgson of North Carolina State University and Professor Naoki                  Motoyama of Chiba University, Matsudo, Japan.                                                                                                                   The principal objective of the seminar is to examine the                        toxicological factors involved in the evaluation of both risks                  and benefits of pesticides.  Topics will include assessment of                  the problem of non-target health and environmental effects, the                 role of toxicological factors with particular reference to                      future needs and solutions, and methods to improve both toxicity                testing and risk assessment.  The participants are noted leaders                in their fields of research.  The seminar will address current                  global concerns in this important area, and the results of the                  discussion are expected to help guide the development of new                    pesticides.  Because the U.S. and Japan are the most important                  manufacturers and users of pesticides, with strong research                     capabilities in these areas, this meeting should be of benefit                  to both countries.",
