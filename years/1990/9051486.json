 "awd_abstract_narration": "The emergence of optical fabrication as a viable process to produce             3-dimensional models and parts rapidly and economically will have               significant impact in several industrially important areas.                     Computer-designed parts can be converted overnight to plastic                   models which can be used to make precision tooling, verify design               suitability and many other functions.  Students are able to create              models from their CAD/CAM programs, creating the opportunity for                numerous laboratory projects and experiments.  This technology is               being introduced immediately into the undergraduate curriculum in               mechanical engineering, manufacturing, industrial engineering,                  architectural engineering and physics.  The award is being matched              by an equal amount from the principal investigator's institution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      //",
