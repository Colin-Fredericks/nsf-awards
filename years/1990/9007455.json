 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mammal Collection in the Louisiana State University                    Museum of Natural Science comprises 30,000 specimens, placing it                among the largest such university collections in the U.S.  The                  collection has grown remarkably during the past decade, and more                than half of its current holdings are from the New World                        Tropics.  Dr. Mark Hafner, Curator of Mammals and Director of the               Museum, proposes a renovation of the Museum's collections,                      leading to expanded storage space and incorporation of a large                  collection donated by the University of Southwestern Louisiana.                 New storage cabinets will be installed on a mezzanine to be built               above the present collections area. In consolidating these                      collections, researchers will be given greater access to                        important reference specimens.                                                       Systematic collections in natural history museums are an                   incomparable record of the evolution of life on earth.                          Systematists, ecologists, biogeographers, functional                            morphologists, and researchers from a variety of other                          disciplines are increasingly dependent on these research                        resources.  The continued growth and improvement of these                       collections will have wide impact on research into biological                   diversity.",
