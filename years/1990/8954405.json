 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Great Lakes Research Consortium (GLRC) is immersing 20                      undergraduate faculty in a three week summer practicum that is                  demonstrating environmental problem-solving as an effective teaching            strategy to stimulate undergraduates' interest in environmental                 science.  Undergraduate faculty participants are learning environmental         analysis techniques and preparing environmental impact statements for a         hypothetical development project in a contaminated harbor of Lake               Ontario.  As they are being exposed to new innovative theoretical               concepts and techniques developed by the Great Lakes Research community         to understand and solve environmental problems, participants are being          shown how to integrate environmental problem-solving into curricula at          their home institutions.  Special topics, based on the Great Lakes              experience are including the theories and applications of cascading             trophic interactions and particle-size spectra in community ecology;            analytical methods for determining toxic chemical concentrations in             sediments and fishes; and use of microcomputers for mass-balance and            bioenergetics modeling of large lake systems.  Through preparation of           environmental impact statements for a realistic project, these                  techniques are being integrated into the overall environmental analysis         and problem-solving approach that has stimulated undergraduate interest         in science at two GLRC campuses for a decade.  Participants in the              practicum are returning to their home institutions with expanded and            updated professional skills and new strategies, methods and techniques          for improving undergraduate education and addressing environmental              problems in local communities.",
