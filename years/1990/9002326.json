 "awd_abstract_narration": "Relations between forest canopy geometry, local                            physiological characteristics, and whole-canopy gas-exchange will               be examined.  The goal is understand links between individual-                  plant and whole-canopy physiological processes.  Focus will be on               effects of vertical position on plant physiological processes, to               provide input values for a higher-order closure model of                        turbulent exchange at vegetated surfaces.  The extent to which 1)               canopy position can be used to predict local physiological                      properties and 2) canopy geometry can be used to predict canopy-                level gas exchange will be examined.  It is hypothesized that 1)                radiation flux is a good predictor of leaf-level gas-exchange                   within relatively closed canopies, and 2) leaf-level physiology                 can be predicted by spatial position using a simple structural                  model.  To test these hypotheses and to provide model input                     parameters.  1) gas-exchange characteristics as a function of                   vertical position will be sampled and 2) canopy radiation                       flux/geometry maps using photographic techniques will be                        constructed.  The canopy-level gas-exchange model will be                       validated using eddy correlation.  This research will be                        conducted in close collaboration with research groups at the                    University of California at Davis and the New Zealand Forest                    Research Institute.  Field techniques will be tested in an                      orchard and detailed field studies will be conducted in two well-               studied natural forests.",
