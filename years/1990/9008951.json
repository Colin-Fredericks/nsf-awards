 "awd_abstract_narration": "Affect control theory is a mathematical model that describes how                social roles, behaviors, and emotions are related to one another.               This project uses five studies to test predictions from the                     theory.  The first study tests the theory in natural settings by                sampling people's emotions at random times throughout their                     normal waking activities.  It will be one of the first studies to               get a representative sample of the emotions that people actually                experience.  The theory argues that people's emotions should                    change in specific ways when they change from one role to                       another.  The second study will use subjects' reactions to                      descriptions of unusual events (presented to them under                         controlled laboratory conditions) to test ideas about how these                 atypical situations may influence emotional responses.  The third               and fourth studies test predictions about how other peoples'                    emotional reactions influence what we think about them.  The                    fifth study pursues some practical implications of this idea for                the criminal justice system.  If the theory is true, the                        sentences handed down to convicted criminals are influenced in                  counterintuitive ways by their emotional displays.",
