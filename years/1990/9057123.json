 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research under this Presidential Young Investigator Award will have             three main thrusts.  The first is the development of improved                   submillimeter receiver components.  The Principal Investigator is               particularly interested in expoiting superconducting thin film and              tunnel junction technology to develop novel submillimeter circuits.             Devices such as SIS mixers, 2-dimensional imaging arrays,                       submillimeter Josephson oscillators, SQUID and parametric                       amplifiers, low-loss transmission lines, passive components such                as filters couplers, and perhaps even integrated receivers are all              feasible with this technology.  The second thrust is the                        construction of practical receiver systems for astronomical use at              the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory and the Antarctic Telescope               and also on airborne telescopes, and eventually for space missions.             This effort will be pursued in parallel with the first, using                   existing components when necessary but taking advantage of new                  components as they are developed.  The third thrust is the                      employment of these receivers to attack astrophysical problems.                 Principal interests at present are the structure and physics of                 molecular clouds, photodissociation regions, molecular outflows,                and star-forming regions.  Submillimeter spectroscopy is the                    optimal method for studying the warm and dencse gas typically found             in these regions.",
