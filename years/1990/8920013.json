 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Uetz and Mr. Clark will investigate visual communication                    behavior and its role in species recognition in salticid spiders,               which have well-developed vision.  Experiments will be performed                to study the relative importance of morphology (form, coloration,               markings) and species-specific behavior patterns (movement,                     sequence) of courting males in eliciting responses from females.                                                                                                Using a newly-developed method, Dr. Uetz and Mr. Clark will                     investigate the interaction of morphology and behavior in                       courtship of Maevia inclemens, a salticid spider that has two                   distinct male forms differing in appearance and behavior.                       Courtship behavior sequences of males of both types will be                     videotaped, digitized, and stored on the computer.  Morphological               characteristics and behavioral patterns of the two morphs will                  then be experimentally manipulated using computer/video animation               techniques, and presented to female spiders on microtelevision                  screens.  Responses of female spiders to various combinations of                these computer-generated video images, as well as to videotapes                 of real spiders, will be studied.                                                                                                                               By experimentally separating form and behavior, and recombining                 them in novel combinations, Dr. Uetz and Mr. Clark will be able                 to have complete control over stimuli presented to the female                   (which is not possible with live male spiders), and to identify                 critical visual elements involved in courtship of this unique                   spider.  These experimental studies will allow Dr. Uetz and Mr.                 Clark to test hypotheses about animal communication and its                     adaptive functions, and will contribute to better understanding                 of species-recognition mechanisms.  In addition, the development                of this powerful new computer-assisted technique for studying                   animal behavior has enormous potential for a number of areas of                 investigation, including mate choice, agonistic behavior, visual                perception, and neurophysiology.",
