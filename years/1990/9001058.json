 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continued NSF support for the Research                      Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program in Evolutionary                    Biology at the American Museum of Natural Hi story.  Drawing on the             research and teaching expertise of the Museum's scientific staff,               the program revolves around projects carefully designed to                      introduce undergraduate level students to the excitement and                    challenge of original research in Evolutionary Biology.  Included               in the program structure is a series of weekly meetings at which                students will discuss their research, present informal progress                 reports, and take part in discussions and seminars on graduate and              research career opportunities.  A special lecture series, in which              eminent evolutionary biologists will be invited to address the REU              students has been planned to supplement their roundtable discussion             series.  At the end of the program, students will participate in                a seminar where they will give a formal presentation of their work.             Students will be encouraged to continue regular contact with their              Project Supervisors and prepare their research results in the form              of joint authored papers for submission to professional journals.               The AMNH will institute a follow-up program for REU participants                aimed at encouraging them in careers in science.",
