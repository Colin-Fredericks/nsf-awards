 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decision analysis provides a theoretically appealing approach to                making decisions in the face of uncertainty and multiple conflicting            objectives.  Unfortunately, most decision makers (DMs) have been                unwilling to adopt this rationale approach to important decision                problems, in part, due to the stringent information demands it places           on them in applying its concepts and methods.  This research project            involves the development of a novel interactive approach and prototype          decision support system (DSS) for performing decision analysis which            relaxes its stringent measurement requirements by precluding the need           for the DM to assess his/her beliefs and tastes directly, precisely,            and/or completely.  The philosophical basis of the approach is based on         robutness and is aimed at making decision analysis a potentially more           accessible and viable tool for decision making in practice.  The                investigators' initial effort focused on making decisions under                 uncertainty based on imprecise, incomplete beliefs or tastes.  They now         extend our approach (1) to include making decisions under uncertainty           when both beliefs and tastes are imprecisely and/or incompletely                specified, (2) to include multiple criteria decision problems when              either or both tradeoffs and individual attribute value functions are           imprecisely and/or incompletely specified, (3) to incorporate knowledge         and experience-based intelligence into our RID methodology and DSS for          prediction and learning to reduce the cognitive demands on the DM and           accelerate the solution process, and (4) to develop the system                  principles and prototype design for an integrated, intelligent DSS that         can simultaneously support decision making under uncertainty and                multiple criteria decision making.                                                                                                                              The contribution of the research will be both theoretical and                   pragmatic.  For example, on a theoretical level, research in decision           analysis under conditions of both imprecise probability and utility             functions should reveal new insights regarding the dynamics of the              relationship between imprecise beliefs, tastes, and choice preferences          when making decisions under uncertainty.  Further, the treatment of             attribute weights and conditional value/utility functions as random             variables in multiattribute utility analysis should allow us to specify         the probability function of the imprecisely induced aggregated                  value/utility intervals associated with alternatives.  Such information         permits the use of stochastic dominance concepts to filter inferior             alternatives.  From a pragmatic perspective, the results of this                research should lead to the development of a methodology and integrated         DSS that should allow more pervasive and successful applications of             decision analysis in practice.",
