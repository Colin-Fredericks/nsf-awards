 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support continued collaborative research between                Dr. Alan Hooper, University of Minnesota and Dr. Claude Balny,                  French National Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM),             Montpellier.  This research is aimed at understanding the chemical              functioning of hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO), a key enzyme                 employed by the nitrifying bacterium Nitrosomonas in aerobic                    oxidation of soil-bound nitrogen.                                                                                                                               In the proposed project, the investigators will use the techniques              of stopped-flow to study spectral changes in HAO and other                      chromophoric electron transfer components.  They will further                   study the structure of the active site by comparing the rate of                 reaction of the subtrates with the rate of reaction of subtrate                 analogs and binding of competitive inhibitors.  In addition, they               will investigate the kinds of electron carriers mediating between               HAO and the terminal oxidase.  Dr. Hooper is an internationally                 recognized expert on bacterial-nitrification.  The expertise of                 Dr. Balny on stopped-flow in general and on this enzyme system in               particular makes continuation of the collaboration appropriate.                 In addition, Dr. Balny has one of the few facilities in the world               where kinetics can be measured at highly controlled temperature                 and high hydrostatic pressures.  The results of this research will              contribute to increased understanding of enzymic oxidation of                   fertilizer ammonia in soils.  Beyond fundamental interest to                    biochemists, this work has important potential applications to                  understanding the soil nitrogen cycle and to control the agricul-               tural loss of soil nitrogen through various denitrification                     mechanisms.",
