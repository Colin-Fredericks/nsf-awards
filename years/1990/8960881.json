 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research under earlier Phase I and Phase II SBIR awards to                      Continuum Dynamics showed that the addition of fixed panels to                  the rear of a tractor-trailer rig reduced air drag by 10% and                   suggested that reductions as large as 25% might be achievable.                  The current Phase I SBIR award aims at identifying drag                         reduction devices which are retractable, stowable, and which                    approach a 20% reduction in air drag.  Various geometries will                  be tested on a modified passenger van.  Measurements will                       include wind speed and direction, ground speed of the vehicle,                  and pressure distribution over the aft region of the van.  In                   addition, high speed films will be made to reveal overall flow                  patterns.                                                                                                                                                       It is estimated that reduction of air drag by 20% for the                       nation's existing trailer fleet would save 2 billion gallons                    of diesel fuel a year.  The associated favorable impact on the                  US fuel usage and air quality would be considerable.",
