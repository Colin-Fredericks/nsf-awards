It follows a \"quick                                  response\" award made to Dames and Moore for                                     the collection of perishable data from the                                      earthquake.                                                                                                                                                     The Loma Prieta earthquake affected the                                         performance of virtually every type of                                          lifeline in the San Francisco Bay Area,                                         including natural gas systems.  Natural gas                                     systems were severely affected in areas of                                      significant ground failure, such as in the                                      Marina district, where several large fires                                      erupted after the initial ground shock.  There                                  was concern that uncontrolled fires would be                                    fueled by gas leaks in the area.  Fortunately,                                  the fires were contained by utilizing several                                   alternative water sources.                                                                                                                                      The aim of this project is to study the                                         effects of the earthquake on local natural gas                                  systems.  Specifically it analyzes the data                                     collected as part of the \"quick response\"                                       award, in order to develop better seismic risk                                  evaluation models for natural gas systems, and                                  to determine whether existing safety devices,                                   such as seismic shutoff valves, are a feasible                                  solution for mitigating overall earthquake                                      losses.                                                                                                                                                         An analysis of these data builds upon limited                                   studies which already exist for these systems.                                  A comparison of performance data from this                                      event to similar data from the 1971 San                                         Fernando and the 1987 Whittier Narrows                                          earthquakes is critical in order to quantify                                    differences in performance due to regional                                      factors and level of earthquake preparedness.",
