 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested to obtain a MicroVAX III (DEC 3600), four                   workstations (IRIS 4D/20 or equivalent) and a fast processor                    (Silicon Graphics 4D/240 or equivalent) for a powerful computing                facility to carry out crystallographic structure analyses and                   refinement, NMR distance geometry calculations, and molecular                   dynamics simulations in the Departments of Biological Structure                 and Biochemistry.  Projects which will benefit from these                       resources include studies on blue copper proteins, iron sulfur                  proteins, nitrite reductase, hemerythrin, rubrerythrin,                         lysophospholipase, neocarzinostatin, auromomycin, II crystallin,                and coagulation factor XIII. NMR related projects include                       calmodulin, zinc-fingers, histidine-containing protein, as well                 as studies developing programs to refine models by simulating NOE               dynamics.  Analysis of the extremely fast reactions of bacterial                reaction centers from a semi-empirical quantum mechanical                       approach will also benefit from these resources.  Our current                   computer resources, made up of a venerable VAX 11/780 (purchased                in 1978) and three workstations, limits our ability to carry out                crystallographic refinement efficiently or to pursue research                   problems using NMR techniques and molecular dynamics                            calculations.  The proposed equipment will provide cpu speed to                 effectively remove these limits on our studies of molecular                     structure and function and significantly enhance our ability to                 explore new research directions.",
