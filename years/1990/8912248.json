 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seward Marine Center (SMC) is the farthest-north university                 marine station in the United States.  It is ideally situated to                 support studies of circumpolar, North Pacific, Gulf of Alaska,                  and Bering Sea organisms requiring water temperatures ranging                   from 3-10oC.  Further, the SMC is the proposed site of several                  interdisciplinary studies of ocean-atmosphere interactions and                  sea-surface interannual variability.  There is increasing                       international concern about high-latitude manifestations of                     global warming and atmospheric ozone destruction, and an                        increasing National emphasis on arctic and subarctic research                   mandated by the Arctic Research and Policy Act.  These                          developments will increase demand for SMC research facilities.                                                                                                  This project provides funds to purchase materials for renovating                and upgrading the seawater supply system at the SMC. The                        renovations will include installation of two new, 8-inch-                       diameter, 600-foot-long seawater intake pipes and one new pump.                 The Institute of Marine Science, which operates the SMC, will                   match the NSF award by covering the costs of labor and additional               materials, the renovations are urgently needed because the                      present system often fails and lacks adequate backup.  Further,                 the capacity of the present seawater system is barely adequate                  for research being conducted now; anticipated increasing need for               the facility in the next 5 years cannot be met without the                      proposed renovations.//",
