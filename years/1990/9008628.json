 "awd_abstract_narration": "In spite of the wide variety of synchronization problems and their              broad-ranging solutions, some fundamental questions regarding the               nature and classification of synchronization have remained unanswered.          Led by the observation that any synchronization necessarily involves            some kind of arbitration among the participating processes.  The                notion of the \"rank\" of a process that serves as the basis for                  arbitration has been formulated, and an underlying mechanism, called            the \"ranker\", that computes the ranks for the processes has been                identified.  In order to carry out any kind of arbitration, the ranks           that are computed by the ranker module should satisfy certain                   requirements.  By identifying these properties, four different                  specifications are obtained for the ranker module; these four rankers           form a hierarchy.  Based on the correspondence between a                        synchronization problem and the weakest ranker that can be used to              solve it, a classificiation of synchronization problems is obtained.            This classification subsumes the other classification proposed in the           literature.  The problem of implementing rankers on various                     architectures will be considered and the project intends to devise              algorithms for translating programs across different architectures.",
