 "awd_abstract_narration": "A unique group of monoclonal antibodies that are specific for                   the dicarboxylate, monocarboxylate, and glutamate/aspartate                     transporters of the inner mitochondrial membrane of pea                         plants will be used to screen lambda gt11 libraries for cDNA                    clones of these transport proteins.  A partial clone for the                    dicarboxylate transporter has already been isolated and the                     work will initially concentrate on this protein.  Once full                     length clones are available, they will be sequenced and                         molecular modelling techniques used to evaluate their                           structures within the membrane.  When a structural model has                    been obtained, it will be tested by using antibodies and                        chemical modifiers, both targeted to synthetic peptides, to                     confirm the model by evaluating that portions of the proteins                   are exposed to the cytosolic and matrix face of the                             mitochondrial membrane.  The cDNA clones will be used to                        produce the precursor form of the protein by in vitro                           transcription/translation and heterologous expression in                        bacteria.  These immature forms of the protein will be used                     to study the incorporation of the transporter into the                          mitochondrial membrane.  They also will be used in an attempt                   to isolate and reconstitute the receptor protein that is                        responsible for recognizing the transport protein and guiding                   its incorporation into the membrane.                                                                                                                            Mitochondria are the living cell's energy factory.  Movement                    of molecules into and out of mitochondria plays an integral                     part in the cell's energy metabolism.  The mitochondrion has                    a very complex membrane structure which has not been                            amendable to biochemical analysis.  New techniques of                           molecular biology are being used to understand the membranes                    in which energy is generated and molecules are transported.",
