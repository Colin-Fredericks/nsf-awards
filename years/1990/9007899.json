 "awd_abstract_narration": "Past studies have suggested that nutrient\u001a.\u001apoor sites have                     greater nutrient immobilization in the litter, greater                          belowground allocation of biomass, and slower decay; all                        resulting in more conservative nutrient cycles.  Most of these                  studies focused on forested ecosystems with minimal emphasis                    on belowground dynamics.  The primary objectives of this new                    research project are (1) to quantify the relationships between                  C and N availability and belowground dynamics across a                          nutrient-poor, dynamic, barrier island landscape; (2) to                        quantify the influences of microtopography, successional age                    and microenvironmental interfaces (caused by fluctuating                        groundwater levels) on belowground processes; and (3) to                        refine and extend the application of newer techniques for                       belowground research. The research will be conducted along an                   established transect incommunities 65, 35, 25 and 5 years old                   on the accreting end of Hog Island on NSF's Virginia Coast                      Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site.  Nitrogen                    amended and unamended plots will be used to test the effects                    of nitrogen availability on belowground processes.  Root                        production, root decomposition, nitrogen immobilization rates                   in root litter, mineralization rates, and root and soil                         nitrogen content will be measured in the treatment and control                  plots. Reciprocal litter bag transplants will test the degree                   of control of root decomposition by external nitrogen supply                    versus litter quality.  All processes will be evaluated in                      relation to microenvironmental conditions and successional age                  along the transect and vertically within the soil profile.                      The application of minirhizotrons in barrier island ecosystems                  will also be tested.                                                                                                                                            Results from the project will be of fundamental importance to                   the basic ecological resolution of the governance of nutrient                   dynamics and plant community composition in nutrient-poor                       ecosystems.  Additionally, the work should produce insights to                  assist in better management of barrier islands and                              beachfronts, areas where the interests of conservation,                         recreation and commercial development often collide.                                                                                                            The principal investigator is well qualified, and                               institutional facilities are adequate to the task. Integration                  of this new project with the ongoing research program of the                    Virginia Coast Reserve LTER project will result in productive                   augmentation of both efforts.",
