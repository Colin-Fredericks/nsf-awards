 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to investigate how people use graphic               information in making judgments and decisions.  Research on human               judgment has become increasingly concerned with the compatibility               between the manner in which information is portrayed and the                    associated information processing strategies invoked in making a                decision.  However, relatively little is known about the effects                of information display on decision making.                                                                                                                      The two basic concepts behind the research are the lens model                   paradigm and the compatibility hypothesis.  The plan of the                     research is to undertake a series of empirical studies to examine               compatibility effects between the form of the graphic information               display and the context of the judgment tasks.  The lens model                  framework is used to conceptualize the relationship between human               judgmental processes and the elements or cues in the stimulus                   environment.  Graphic displays will be constructed using varying                display characteristics.  An important task variable to be studied              is time pressure.  The research will advance both the development               of descriptive theory of human decision behavior and the                        development of decision aids to improve decision making.",
