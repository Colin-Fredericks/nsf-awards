 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                      Organometallic Chemistry program is to develop the chemistry of                 complex ions of such metals as platinum and rhodium with                        non-aqueous solvent molecules as the only ligands. It is                        expected that the solvent molecules be can displaced easily                     from the metal, allowing the synthesis of complexes which                       cannot be prepared in the usual way starting with the metal                     chlorides. The new compounds which will be synthesized will                     have potential value as catalysts or as reagents for the                        synthesis of organic compounds.                                                                                                                                 Complexes with non-aqueous solvent molecules, such as                           acetonitrile, as ligands will be explored as starting materials                 for the synthesis of ligand-deficient complexes. The solvent                    complexes will be obtained from halide complexes by reaction                    with halide abstraction reagents, such as thallium hexafluoro-                  phosphate or sodium tetraphenylborate, in the presence of a                     sigma-donor solvent, such as acetonitrile. Reactions of these                   solvent complexes with an unusual phosphine,                                    tris(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)phosphine, TMPP, will be explored.                  Preliminary results indicate that homoleptic complexes with                     only two TMPP molecules bound to the cation can be obtained,                    due to the steric bulk of the TMPP ligand. These coordinatively                 unsaturated kinetic products are expected to exhibit high                       reactivity, especially with regard to susceptibility of the                     metal center toward attack by small substrates. Attempts will                   be made to prepare low-valent transition metal complexes of                     TMPP, so that these complexes may be used to probe the binding                  and potential activation of small molecules such as carbon                      monoxide, carbon dioxide, dinitrogen and dihydrogen.",
