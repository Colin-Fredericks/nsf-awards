 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is designed to determine how the structure of                     photosystem II (PSII) and associated cofactors mediate electron                 transfer from water to the primary electron donor, P680.  The                   focus of this project is on the role of the D1 reaction center                  polypetide of PSII in oxygen evolution.  Mutant strains of                      Chlamydomonas which still accumulate PSII reaction center                       complexes but which show impaired electron transfer, particularly               on the oxidizing side of the complex are being identified and                   isolated by Dr. Jeanne Erickson at UCLA.  These mutants are being               characterized biophysically and compared to wild-type cells by                  examining:  1) the concentration of PSII reaction centers, 2) the               relative rates of electron transfer and the equilibrium constants               which govern electron transfer between the OEC, Z and the                       oxidized primary electron, P680+, 3) the quantum yield of primary               charge separation, 4) the amount of oxygen released in each of a                series of saturating light flashes and 5) the number of oxidizing               equivalents that can be extracted from the donor side before                    electron transfer is halted.  Altered optical and EPR                           spectroscopic signals arising from the oxidizing side of the                    reaction center as well as the concentration of the manganese                   cluster associated with PSII responsible for the oxidation of                   water to molecular oxygen are being studied in collaboration with               Dr. Gary Brudvig of Yale University.                                                                                                                            Terrestrial, aquatic and marine plants are the primary source of                renewable biomass on earth.  Through the process of                             photosynthesis plants convert radiant energy received from the                  sun into chemical energy.  This energy drives the conversion of                 atmospheric carbon dioxide into sugars and other compounds, such                as fats and proteins, which are essential components of all                     living organisms.  Photosynthesis also results in the production                of oxygen, and this oxygen is crucial for sustaining all forms of               life that rely on respiration in order to provide the energy to                 keep them alive.  The purpose of this research project is to gain               an increased understanding of the biochemical and physical                      reactions that take place during photosynthesis by plants,                      resulting in the production of oxygen and consumption of carbon                 dioxide.  Most of this research will be done on a simple                        unicellular plant which is well suited to analysis by modern                    molecular biology and therefore provides an excellent model                     system for study.",
