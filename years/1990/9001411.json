 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four areas of mathematical research are represented in this                project.  In general terms, the work reflects the application of                methods of harmonic analysis to problems in the theory of partial               differential equations and operators.                                                One theme concerns what are now called Fatou theorems for                  classes of nonlinear elliptic equations, including the important                p-Laplacian.  The object is to determine, for nonnegative                       solutions, the extent to which the solution has nontangential                   boundary values.  A primary goal is to obtain basic estimates on                solutions which depend on the shape of the boundary but do not                  depend on the smoothness of the coefficients in the equation.                        In the same spirit, work will also be done investigating                   existence questions for second order elliptic systems and higher                order elliptic operators defined in nonsmooth domains.  By this,                one usually means domains which occur in the physical world, but                which do not have very smooth boundaries.  Corners and edges are                allowed for example.  It is only in the last decade that any                    major progress has been made toward understanding the extent to                 which one may establish a good existence and regularity theory.                      In the preceding, the major results obtained used techniques               of classical double layer potential theory mixed with modern                    operator theory.  Work will continue on the operators developed                 for the above purposes.  The focus here will be to analyze the                  spectrum of the operators and read from it information about the                operators.  The spectrum is known to consist of real numbers for                classical operators and the conjecture to be studied is that it                 lies in a symmetric interval of length one-half about the origin.                    Finally, work will be done on the Dirichlet problem for                    second order nondivergence form elliptic operators.  Although a                 highly developed theory for such operators has existed since the                early 1950's, there has always been a standing assumption that                  the coefficients of the operator be smooth.  This work breaks                   with that tradition in seeking to define what one would mean by a               reasonable solution when the operator is formed from merely                     bounded coefficients.  Even though one must expect solutions with               discontinuities and distributional derivatives, the potential for               application of this work is very high.",
