 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) has designed a                 plan for a national reform in the scope, sequence, and coordination             of secondary school science programs which spreads the teaching of              science through all six years of grades 7-12 and which emphasizes               the progression in teaching and learning from the concrete to the               abstract.  The reform effort, which is already under way on a small             scale under Federal funding, is to be tested in a number of                     sites(pilot centers) throughout the country.                                                                                                                    This project is designed to enable NSTA to become the coordination              center for the reform effort.  NSTA will coordinate activities of               the pilot centers including assessment, evaluation, and                         documentation.  In addition, NSTA will be working with six                      curriculum committees to design, compile, and disseminate project               materials to be used by pilot centers in their curriculum                       restructuring efforts.  NSTA will serve as the hub of a network                 which links the pilot centers through meetings, newsletters, and                computer conferencing.",
