 "awd_abstract_narration": "Zygotes and young embryos of Fucus provide a model system to                    study the basic mechanisms involved in the generation of                        zygotic/cell asymmetry and partitioning of localized cytoplasmic                components to the resulting daughter cells. These polar processes               are common to many different organisms; from yeasts, amphibians,                and nematodes, to vertebrates, mammals and plants. However, to                  understand how a cell establishes a polar axis and directionally                transports cytoplasmic material to a predetermined site defined                 by the axis, is difficult to study and experimentally manipulate                in most of these organisms. In contrast, eggs of the Fucales are                apolar, there is no apparent spatial patterning in the egg, and                 \"polar determinants\" are not localized in the egg and rotated by                such vectors such as unilateral light. Hence the polar axis                     arises epigenetically in response to these gradients, in                        synchronous cultures of single-celled zygotes, and is amenable to               experimental analysis. The proposed goals are to: 1) characterize               the proteins in the axis stabilizing complex at the site of polar               growth, and prepare polyclonal antibodies to these proteins for                 use in: a) testing the role of these gene products in polar axis                fixation, and b) screening a cDNA expression library to isolate                 and characterize the genes coding for these critical structural                 components that are asymmetrically localized, 2) construct                      rhizoid and thallus specific cDNA libraries, using both                         transcriptional and expression vectors, and identify clones                     whose; a) transcripts are locally expressed in either the                       rhizoid or thallus cell, and b) protein products may play a role                in axis fixation or rhizoid function as a part of the axis                      stabilizing complex; 3) determine the role of localized gene                    products identified above by; a) antisense RNA techniques, which                first requires the development of transient transformation                      techniques (e.g. microinjection, electroporation and                            microprojectiles) to identify chimeric gene constructs that are                 expressed in zygotes, and b) microinjection of antibodies to                    determine the role of specific proteins in polar processes.                     %%%                                                                             This project attempts to determine the mechanisms involved in the               development of asymmetry in an organism from a initially radially               symmetric egg.",
