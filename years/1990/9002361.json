 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Liblice Conferences aze international meetings held every three             years and devoted to both basic research and applications of                    molecular theories of liquids.  They are sponsored by the Chemical              Physics section of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences.  A                     possible counterpart in the US is the biennial Gordon Conference                on the Chemistry and Physics of Liquids, which is a national and                somewhat international forum on experimental work on and molecular-             level modeling of dense fluids phases.  The Liblice conferences,                however, draw a wider segment of their audience from the European               continent, including, of course, the Eastern European countries.                                                                                                The Third Liblice Conference will take place from May 28 to                     June 1, 1990 in Bechyne, Czechoslovakia, is intended to                         provide an effective opportunity for personal contacts and                      exchange of ideas, with emphasis on discussions, in addition                    to formal presentations.  The meeting should also present a                     state-of-the-art picture of the achievements and challenges in                  both the fundamental and applied aspects of the discipline.                     It is an event of significant and the US presence is                            critically important.",
