 "awd_abstract_narration": "The RESTORING THE EARTH television series will be                          presented by the Restoring the Earth organization in                            association with South Carolina Educational Television and                      James Lipscomb Inc., a television documentary producer.                         RESTORING THE EARTH is about the greatest challenge facing our                  species today: restoring our ailing Planet to health.  The                      story is told in five, hour-long documentary programs designed                  for initial release on public television and later use in                       classrooms.  This series brings viewers an intimate look at the                 struggles and triumphs of men and women engaged in the science                  and technology of environmental restoration, amidst the                         diversity and glory of the natural world.  RESTORING THE EARTH                  is a hopeful look at our environmental condition, showcasing                    success stories and good tidings, while enhancing public                        scientific understanding of the looming threats to life on                      Earth.  The unifying theme is environmental renewal - the                       healing of damaged resources and the re-creation of healthy                     ecosystems from the wreckage of forests, rivers, prairies,                      wetlands, and wildlife.  The series also shows how urban areas                  are being ecologically redesigned.  Each program is self-                       contained and can be presented alone or as part of the series.                  The programs are about restoring rivers and streams (Program                    1), restoring wildlife (Program 2), healing lakes and                           rebuilding wetlands (Program 3), restoring forests, mines, and                  prairies (Program 4), restoring the air, stabilizing the                        climate, and building ecologically sound cities (Program 5).                    The programs include stories such as, \"River Revival,\" \"The                     Prairie Makers,\" \"Predator's Return,\" \"The Marsh Builders,\"                     \"Floodplains Aflame,\" \"Streams Reborn,\" \"Lake Revival,\" \"Quiet                  Mines,\" \"The Toxic Temple,\" \"Wetlands Regained,\" and                            \"Tomorrow's Cities.\"  The RESTORING THE EARTH television series                 highlights humanity's capacity for repairing environmental                      damage to the Earth.  Each episode will relate what has been                    done, what is being done, and what can be done to solve current                 environmental problems and restore the Earth.",
