 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mississippian Antler basin is a well known but poorly                  understood sedimentary system.  It has been called a foreland,                  but the geometry and timning of the orogeny that formed the basin               have been the subject of diverse speculation.  Preliminary work                 has revealed new stratigraphic detail and several features that                 are anomalous for a foreland: synorogenic deformation is mild and               poorly preserved, deformation took place as several discrete                    events that caused uplift, the basin was wide and shallow, the                  foreland was long-lived but the sedimentary section is not thick,               and the sedimentary sequences are mostly transgressive.                              Current foreland basin models are defined by the type of                   associated orogency, and basin stratigraphy reflects ongoing                    tectonism.  The stratigraphy of the Antler system provides an                   excellent test of these foreland basin models, because it differs               from most foreland systems described to date.  This project will                emphasize detailed sedimentology of newly recognized                            stratigraphic sequences, mapping of sedimentary facies, and                     analysis of synorogenic deformation.  The results will be applied               to existing models of foreland evolution in order to expand                     foreland basin models.",
