 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for pre-drilling activities                    connected with a project whose ultimate objective is to obtain a                nearly continuous, ordered record of the output of an oceanic                   volcano over a long interval of its main shield-building phase of               activity.  Only small fractions of the output and history of any                individual Hawaiian volcano are accessible through surface                      exposures and it is unlikely that the interiors of these                        volcanoes will ever be exposed except by deep drilling.                                                                                                              The primary scientific questions to be addressed concern the               nature of hot spots, in particular, the composition and origin                  of the \"plumes\" they may represent, and how the upwelling                       material interacts with the lithosphere on time scales of 105 to                106 years.                                                                                                                                                           The specific activities being supported by this award                      include: 1) finalizing the site selection and evaluating                        permitting issues; 2) finalizing, with detailed justification,                  the proposed hole depth; 3) reviewing and modifying, if                         necessary, the drilling plan and downhole measurements plan to                  insure that the proposed hole can be logged as necessary for the                scientific objectives; and 4) determining the makeup of the                     complete science team.",
