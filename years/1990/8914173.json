 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Peter Bodenheimer and his colleague at the University of                    California, Santa Cruz, Dr. Douglas Lin will use theoretical                    techniques to study the progression through the process of star                 formation to the formation of planets.  The theoretical models are              constrained by the properties of the planetary system as well as                by the rich observational information now available regarding young             stellar objects.                                                                                                                                                The origin and evolution of the solar nebula and the formation of               the planets provides a challenging problem for the theorist.                    Theories must explain extensive compilations of observational data,             ranging from meteoritic abundance anomalies to the properties of                outflows from young stars.  Recently there has been a rapid                     accumulation of infrared and ultraviolet data from T Tauri stars,               which has led to the strengthening of the hypothesis that accretion             disks are present around many of these objects.  These disks may                be protoplanetary disks.  A wide variety of physical processes is               involved and must be incorporated into theoretical studies of star              and planet formation.  Drs. Bodenheimer and Lin concentrate on the              formation and evolution of the solar nebula itself.  Significant                progress is being made with the aid of enhanced interdisciplinary               contact and improved computer facilities.",
