 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of hearing often rely on measuring responses in single                  neurons to pure tones, which are relatively simple stimuli.  But                naturally occurring sounds often are very complex, both in their                frequency spectrum and their temporal pattern.                                                                                                                  This project, under the Research Opportunities for Women, will                  provide a planning grant to use a novel stimulus technique to                   explore the central auditory responses.  Stimuli with rich                      spectra are used to elicit spiking activity in neurons, and the                 probability of spiking is correlated with excitatory or                         inhibitory inputs to that cell.  This probing technique will be                 used on a major center for auditory processing, the cochlear                    nucleus, during development.  Results will form the basis for                   research aimed at a more complete characterization of neuron                    responses in the cochlear nucleus, including how those responses                develop from connections that become established.",
