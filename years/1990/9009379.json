 "awd_abstract_narration": "By comparison to our knowledge of U.S. House elections, our                     understanding of Senate elections and the institution itself remains            impoverished.  We know rather little about how voters choose their              Senators, how Senators represent the interests of their constituents,           and the kinds of campaigns that Senators and their opponents wage.  The         problem is not that Senate elections are of little theoretical                  interest:  the study of elections provides an excellent and in some             respects optimal entree to fundamental questions for American                   democratic politics.  Nor is it a case of indifference on the part of           the research community:  there is in fact a considerable and growing            interest in the study of Senate elections.  The problem, rather, is the         absence of appropriate data:  our comparative ignorance reflects the            drastic limitations of the evidence now available.                                                                                                              This project involves a study of Senate elections to repair this                defect, justified by the substantive and theoretical advances that the          study will make possible.  Advances will come in concentrated form on           four topics, each fundamental to understanding the contemporary                 American political system:  (1) political representation, of interest           not least because, contrary to the intentions of the framers of the             Constitution, the contemporary Senate appears to be more responsive to          popular sentiment than the House; (2) the \"simple act of voting,\"               Senate elections provide a comparative context for elaborating and              testing theories of voter choice that is useful in and of itself but            that also throws light on voter choice in other settings; (3) divided           government, now the norm in the American system of separated powers,            one that appears to menace coherent legislation and erode political             accountability; and (4) the nature and consequences of political                campaigns, Senate elections provide an opportunity to examine the               interplay among candidates, the political institutions governing                elections, and voters in a particularly powerful way, one that is               simply unavailable in other electoral arenas.                                                                                                                   With support from the National Science Foundation, the Principal                Investigator and National Election Studies Board, initiated in 1988 the         first phase of a three-part study of Senate elections.  The present             study involves a data collection of the 1990 Senate elections through           telephone interviews with a national sample of 3,750 members of the             eligible electorate.  The average length of the interviews is 35                minutes and will involve a randomly selected set of respondents,                divided among all 50 states, interviewed in the period immediately              following the November general elections.  Initial analyses of the 1988         Senate elections suggest that the study to be conducted here will have          the same kind of explosive impact for research on Senate elections              that the 1978 National Election Study has had on our understanding of           the House.",
