The program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers                       to conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions                   of proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                     conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions                       in foreign countries.                                                                                                                                           This award will support a three month visit by Dr. Paul N.                      Romani to France to work with Drs. Daniel Gautier and R\u001agis                     Courtin of the D\u001apartement de Recherches Spatiales in                           Meudon on \"Numerical Modelling of Titan Photochemistry.\"                        The researchers will develop a photochemical model of                           Titan's atmosphere by modifying an existing methane                             photochemical model for the outer planets.  They will then                      use the resulting predicted mixing ratios of trace                              constituents (CH2, C2H2, C2H6, C2H4, C4H2, C4H3, C3H8,                          HCN, HC3N, and C2N2) to generate synthetic spectra and                          compare these against Voyager Infrared Interferometer                           Spectrometer and Radiometer (IRIS) observations.  These                         species are present in only trace amounts, yet they are                         important for an understanding of Titan's atmosphere for                        several reasons: these molecules affect the thermal                             structure of the atmosphere, many of them are potential                         condensates and precursors to other condensates, and they                       can be used as dynamical tracers.  This will be a significant                   improvement over the last major numerical modelling effort                      of Titan photochemistry because of 1) recent improved                           laboratory measurements necessary for photochemical                             modelling, and 2) the ability to directly test the model                        against the Voyager IRIS observations of Titan.  This model-                    observation interaction will allow for direct testing of the                    importance of various chemical reaction rates, of which many                    still have to be estimated in the temperature region of                         interest for Titan, and the strength of other model                             parameters, e.g. eddy transport.",
