 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transitions into employment have been studied extensively within                the \"search\" framework -- a paradigm which incorporates                         uncertainty in the labor market explicitly. Theoretical models                  have been developed; wage and unemployment duration data have                   been interpreted in light of this theory using estimation methods               developed primarily for this purpose; the theory has then been                  revised and refined in light of empirical findings. Overall, this               research has advanced out understanding of the dynamics of                      unemployed worker behavior and provided insights into important                 policy issues (unemployment benefits, in particular). Transitions               out of jobs and between jobs -- long recognized as a major form                 of motion in the labor market --  have not been studied as                      extensively. Theoretical models of job-exit behavior have been                  developed within the search framework, but empirical research                   has lagged behind.                                                                                                                                              Planning activities for an empirical analysis of variation in                   job-exit behavior across major demographic groups in the U.S.                   labor force are the focus of this project. Specifically, the                    potential of both parametric and nonparametric estimation                       techniques for determining patterns of systematic variation in                  job-exit behavior across workers in alternative age, race and                   gender groups will be explored. Among the questions addressed                   will be: (i) Do workers in alternative job groups generally exit                their jobs involuntarily (versus voluntarily) ? and (ii) Are                    there systematic differences across groups in terms of                          destinations? That is, are workers with certain characteristics                 more likely than others to enter alternative jobs directly, or                  perhaps more likely to engage in nonmarket activity? In                         addressing these questions, potential sources of systematic                     variation suggested by economic theory will be investigated.                    These will include the relationship between job-exit behavior and               variation in educational attainment, on-the-job training, marital               status, parental status, occupation and industry attachment,                    union membership and valuation of nonwage benefits (health                      insurance, in particular).                                                                                                                                      The limited experience accumulated on demographic variation in                  job-exit behavior in the U.S. may in part be attributed to                      constraints imposed by the data that have been available to date.               This project includes construction of a labor market histories                  data set for a large, representative sample from the U.S.                       population from the Public Use Files for the 1986 Panel of the                  Survey of Income and Program Participation.",
