 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses a number of open questions concerning the                accurate solution of least squares and eigenvalue problems.  These two          problem areas are interrelated, but there are separate issues for each          one of them.                                                                                                                                                    For the work on least squares problems, there remain important issues           in both the analysis and implementation of the algorithms.  Both                direct and iterative methods for the solution of equality constrained           least squares problems will be considered.  The work on direct methods          concerns error analysis and implementation issues for sparse problems           and for message passing architectures.  The effort on iterative                 methods concerns the development of a class of preconditioners that             would work well on constrained least squares problems.                                                                                                          The investigation of the eigenvalue problems is based upon theoretical          questions.  Recently perturbation bounds on the relative errors in the          eigenvalues of a certain class of symmetric diagonally dominant                 matrices have been developed.  It has been shown that some algorithms           achieve these bounds.  For one important class of algorithms,                   divide-and-conquer algorithms, it is not known whether the relative             error bounds can be achieved.  Since this class of algorithms has               shown good performance on several distributed memory architectures,             the resolution of this open question will have a significant impact on          how eigenvalue problems are solved.",
