 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Alan Kolata, Ms. Patricia Anderson                   will conduct archaeological research to collect data for her                    doctoral dissertation.  Ms. Anderson will carry out both survey                 and excavation at the Mayan site of Yula which dates from the                   classic/post-classic period and is located near the major                       ceremonial center of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan peninsula of                   Mexico.  Because of extensive work which has been done at Chichen               Itza, it should be possible to place Yula into a broader regional               context.  With a team of assistants, Ms. Anderson will clear site               overgrowth and then construct a site map.  Site boundaries will                 be determined and microenvironmental and hydrological resources                 noted.  Buildings and other cultural remains will be plotted and                non-ceramic objects collected.  Test excavations will then be                   placed in rich midden areas to retrieve pottery and other                       material remains.  On this basis it should be possible to                       determine the size of the community and the range of activities                 conducted there.                                                                                                                                                Although much archaeological research has been conducted in the                 Yucatan peninsula, the focus has been almost exclusively on                     \"elite sites\" with impressive temples and public buildings.  What               makes this project important is its examination of a small non-                 elite settlement.  This should aid in producing a more balanced                 picture of Mayan society.  It should also increase archaeological               understanding of how communities of different sizes interacted                  and the over-arching political and economic system which linked                 them.                                                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 assist in the training of an extremely promising young scientist.               Secondly, it will provide new insight into how complex societies                develop.  The information on economic interactions between larger               and smaller agrarian based entities and how these change over                   time may help us to understand processes of development in the                  Third World.",
