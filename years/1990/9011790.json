 "awd_abstract_narration": "Addressing issues of bounded rationality in economics has long been             recognized as an important yet difficult problem.  There has been               a tremendous increase in research on complexity and bounded                     rationality in game theory due to the application of the notion of              an automaton from computer science to problems in economics.  This              project can be divided into three areas: (1) continuing work on                 automation complexity but with a major focus on stochastic Bayesian             games (repeated games with incomplete information); (2)                         applications of complexity analysis to economics; and (3)                       investigations of some new methods of bounding complexity in                    extensive games.                                                                                                                                                The project will make important methodological contributions.  The              work on stochastic Bayesian games is important because it allows                rigorous studies of decision making with differential private                   information.  The research will contribute to our understanding of              important and as yet unresolved issues such as the scope of                     equilibria attainable by bounded players, rule rationality versus               full rationality, Bayesian updating by bounded players, and                     language and complexity.  The project will apply strategic-                     complexity analysis to such important economic problems as market               segmentation and the design of coordination of complex                          organizations using many bounded players.",
