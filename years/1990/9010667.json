 "awd_abstract_narration": "Are market prices a good estimate of value?  Economists routinely               answer yes, but other social and behavioral scientists are less                 certain.  An abundant literature in psychology, political science,              and sociology finds judgement bias in the processing of information             by individuals.  This project examines whether judgement bias about             the value of an asset can affect trading behavior in markets.                   Laboratory experiments are used to test for the existence of                    judgement bias.  A procedure is developed for measuring the cost                of judgement bias in a laboratory setting.  In practical situations             one normally would not be able to control the amount of judgement               bias, hence there is a need for methods that measure the cost of                judgement bias in the absence of experimental control.  These                   empirical methods are developed and two methods of validation are               used.  Market prices might be correctly established in the presence             of judgement bias as long as some group of traders are sufficiently             well-informed and act as arbitragers.  This possibility is examined             as part of the experimental design.                                                                                                                             The ability of markets to accurately forecast future events is                  often taken for granted by economists despite demonstrations by                 psychologists of the existence of substantial judgement biases by               individuals in performing the tasks necessary for the efficient                 operation of markets.  To an economist, the psychological evidence              about these biases is often unconvincing.  The experimental studies             which document their existence frequently use unpaid students who               are required to participate to earn course credit.  Thus                        participants have nothing at stake.  If these biases do exist at                the individual level, can they persist in a market setting where                individuals have financial incentives and can gain experience to                avoid mistakes?  Finally, if these biases do exist are they                     important in any meaningful sense?  Persistent statistical evidence             of widespread judgement bias would be of little importance if                   judgement bias cost an individual only one cent.  This project is               important because it develops rigorous measures of the cost of                  judgement bias and tests for the presence of significant judgement              bias in experimental asset markets.",
