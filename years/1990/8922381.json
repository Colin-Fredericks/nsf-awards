 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop on nonlinear                      phenomena to be held in Santiago, Chile at the University of                    Chile from September 6-15, 1990.  The U.S. organizer is                         Jacobo Rapaport of Ohio University and in Chile there are                       several organizers headed by Patricio Cordero of the University                 of Chile.  There is an international organizing committee which                 includes scientists from Argentina and Brazil as well as from                   Chile.  The participants will come from Mexico and several                      countries in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina, Brazil and                         Chile.  The workshop will cover research topics in fluid                        dynamics near equilibrium (theoretical and experimental),                       fluid dynamics far from equilibrium (turbulence and chaos),                     phase transitions and critical phenomena, nonlinear phenomena                   in condensed matter physics (quantum Hall effect, high                          temperature superconductivity, etc.), mathematical modelling                    (cellular automata, neural networks, learning machines).                                                                                                        An objective of this workshop is to give the opportunity for                    young physicists to become acquainted with current problems                     in nonlinear physics.  In addition, it will provide an                          interactive environment for the exchange of ideas and the                       identification of research topics which will promote future                     collaborations and scientific cooperation among the research                    communities.  The workshop will also bring together Latin                       American physicists which is not always easy to do.  These                      are all good examples of fulfilling the goals of the Science                    in Developing Countries program.",
