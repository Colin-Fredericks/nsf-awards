 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the research of a graduate student in                     cultural anthropology who will study the work of family artisans                who make food specialty items in southwest France.  The project                 will study how such family firms reproduce their economic                       activity in the context of a post-industrial society.  These                    producers are based in local household or family settings for                   production, yet have organized themselves into guilds to                        represent their interests in the wider society.   Using                         participant observation and in-depth life history interviews the                student will analyze how small family-based producers have been                 able to reaffirm their autonomy and mobilize their constituency                 in a context that assumed their disappearance or marginality.                                                                                                   This research is important because family owned business has                    historically been the key to community development for defined                  groups.  Understanding how one such well-defined group has                      asserted and defended its interests can help us understand how                  groups in general can prosper, and so design policies that aid                  groups that have historically not been able to succeed in family                owned business.",
