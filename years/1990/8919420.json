 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the consistency of the formation of rainbands, the Island of             Hawaii is an excellent natural laboratory for the study of the                  interactions of the larger scale flow with mountainous terrain.  An             experiment held during the Summer of 1985 and subsequent numerical              modelling studies have led to a new theory on the formation                     mechanisms of the rainbands off the east coast of the Big Island.                                                                                               The earliest work indicated that rainband formation was caused chiefly          by the interactions between sea/land breeze, mountain/valley breeze             and the trade winds.  The more recent research, however, indicates              that under strong trade wind conditions, the island scale flow may be           more complex and involves the dynamical interactions between the                strong trades and orography.                                                                                                                                    As part of a larger experiment, the Principal Investigators propose to          collect data to test this new hypothesis.  In addition to furthering            our understanding of the physics of these rainbands, the simplicity of          the physics associated with this process should allow an unique                 opportunity to verify and test a mesoscale numerical model which will           have value beyond this experiment.",
