 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this grant, Dr. Abir-Am is completing data collection for her              ongoing study of the role of research schools in the rise of                    molecular biology, 1930-1970.  She aims to clarify the historical               and social processes enabling and constraining transdisciplinary                collaboration, innovation and policy in 20th century science.  The              project revolves around systematic comparisons of four research                 schools, two in the United States and one each in England and                   France.  Among other things, Dr. Abir-Am is examining the research              programs, including both long term theoretical visions and short                term empirical strategies.  These research programs constitute the              sources of conceptual coherence in research schools and of their                capacity for adaptation to changes in the disciplinary ecology at               large.   Comparisons of schools that shared goals but differed in               their methodological strategy reveal relations of competition;                  while comparisons of schools that shared methodological tools but               differed in their conceptual goals reveal relations of                          complementary cooperation.  She is also examining the social                    networks, institutional networks, and policy programs of these                  research schools.   These studies should clarify the interaction                within and across research schools, the historiography of molecular             biology as a gradual or revolutionary event, and the role of                    science policy in the development of new disciplines.",
