 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an ambitious proposal to conduct empirical and theoretical              research on social judgment in negotiation behavior.   Despite the              importance of negotiation, substantial evidence suggests that                   negotiators frequently fail to attain mutually beneficial outcomes.             Inefficient negotiation processes reduce society's resources and                productivity, and increase society's conflicts and self-                        destructiveness.  The purpose of the proposed research is to                    examine why negotiators often arrive at sub-optimal decision                    strategies.                                                                                                                                                     A theoretical model, the Social Perception model, is presented that             focuses on communication, judgment accuracy, behavior, and                      outcomes.  The major prediction from the model is that the accuracy             of negotiators' perceptions of the other party determines                       negotiation outcomes.  Moreover, inaccurate judgments may result                from insufficient information exchange, failure to attend to                    relevant information, or failure to combine information to make a               judgment about the other party's interests.  Four research studies              are proposed to examine implications of the model.  The experiments             promise to advance our understanding of negotiation, to contribute              to sounder theory, and to identify factors that will improve the                outcome of negotiation.",
