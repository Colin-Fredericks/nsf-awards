 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation undertakes a fundamental biochemical                         engineering study to develop a novel methodology for                            determination of kinetic and genetic parameters of primary                      importance to the production of genetically engineered                          organisms.  These important parameters include:  specific                       production rate, gene or plasmid concentration, fraction                        of plasmid-harboring cells, growth ratio of plasmid-                            harboring cells to plasmid-free cells, specific plasmid                         loss rate, relative plasmid loss rate, lumped rate of                           transcription and translation, and gene expression                              efficiency.                                                                                                                                                     There is a total vacuum of the data base of this kind at                        the present time, because of total lack of rational and                         systematic methodology for accurate determination of many                       important parameters, which dictate and control the                             productivity of recombinant organisms.  In view of this                         situation, it is considered critically important to                             develop a relatively simple and yet reliable method by                          which those genetic and kinetic parameters of recombinants                      can be well characterized and determined through both                           theoretical and experimental studies.  Based on                                 preliminary studies, one such method capable of                                 determining accurately those parameters is proposed.  From                      these parameters, other important parameters can be                             estimated and these parameters combined with the                                environmental and operational parameters can then be used                       for design, scale up, and optimization of recombinant                           fermentation processes of industrial importance.  In this                       study, the proposed theoretical method will be evaluated                        experimentally by using at least two selected \"host cell-                       vector\" systems.  Based on experimental results, the                            proposed method of determining the genetic parameters of                        recombinant organisms will be further improved or refined.",
