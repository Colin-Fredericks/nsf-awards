 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Avalon composite terrane of the northern Appalachian                   orogen represent a college of tectonostratigraphic terranes that                were amalgamated in the late Precambrian, accreted as a composite               terrane to North America during the early-middle Paleozoic, and                 were subsequently dispersed variable distances relative to each                 other.  Identification of the constituent terrane elements within               the composite terrane has been controversial, their                             tectonothermal evolution is uncertain, and the nature and timing                of amalgamation, accretion and dispersal are poorly constrained.                This project will address these issue through a comprehensive                   structural and 40Ar/39Ar geochronological study of a                            representative portion of the Avalon composite terrane in                       southwestern New Brunswick where recent studies have shown an                   important late Precambrain terrane boundary may exist.  Results                 of a reconnaissance 40Ar//39Ar isotopic survey indicate that a                  significant contribution can be made in the proposed study area.                     The project couples detailed structural mapping kinematic                  analysis and petrological studies with a program of 40Ar/39Ar                   mineral dating designed to resolve the region's tectonothermal                  evolution.  The study will substantially improve knowledge of the               nature, timing and kinematics of tectonothermal events recorded                 in the Avalon composite terrane and, thereby, will greatly                      facilitate the identification and correlation of constituent late               Precambrian terranes.",
