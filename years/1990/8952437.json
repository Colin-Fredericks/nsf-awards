 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advanced laboratory sequence serves students having a variety               of final goals; graduate school, industrial employment and                      teaching.  Accordingly, a wide variety of experiments and                       teaching modes are used in this sequence.  To ensure the quality                of this sequence in a context of rapid developments in modern                   instrumentation, we must add experiments that expose the students               to measurements which:  (i) produce large volumes of data                       requiring detailed analysis, (ii) are examples of modern                        technologies, and (iii) require more than a perfunctory                         interaction with computers.  Purchase of rf equipment and                       digital oscilloscopes will enable pulsed NMR and second-sound                   experiments to produce large-volume, high-quality data.  Purchase               of fiber optics components and certain accessories for an                       existing high-vacuum thin film evaporator will enable the                       development of experiments illustrating aspects of the modern                   technologies of fiber optics, thin film fabrication and thin-film               properties, and vacuum techniques.  Purchase of PC's will permit                the automation of some experiments, the introduction of Fourier                 transform techniques, and increase student access to data                       analysis facilities.  Purchase of logic analyzers permits a                     critical examination of experiment-computer interfacing                         requirements.",
