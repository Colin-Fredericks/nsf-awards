 "awd_abstract_narration": "Established in 1896, the Flathead Lake Biological Station                  (FLBS) has a long tradition of field-based education and                        research.  In 1980, emphasis on limnology was initiated.  FLBS                  now has a 15-member staff and an annual budget of $700,00 (60%                  extramural).  An additional $2 million has been invested in new                 housing and a Freshwater Research Lab.  NSF awards have provided                a 30` research vessel (1987-88) and research on stream hyporheos                (1987-90) and food webs of oligotrophic lakes (1990-92).  FLBS                  research and monitoring (e.g., daily discharge and temperature;                 chemical variables and biota) has generated long-term data bases                for over 50 sites in the 22,241 km2 Flathead River Basin.  For                  example, limnological and hyrological data for Flathead Lake date               to 1902.  Because these data bases are essential to research on                 the structure and function of the Flathead River-Lake Ecosystem,                a data archival and management will be developed and enhance                    continuous data acquisition capability around long-term research                objectives.  A computer system for data base management, a                      midlake buoy and weather station for Flathead Lake and global                   positioning (GPS) and automated water column profiling systems                  (i.e., continuous GPS, CDT, transmissometer and sonar data logged               on a portable computer for input to existing GIS for the research               vessel are to be acquired.  These items, coupled with existing                  data loggers, sensors and samplers, compose the hardware of the                 data base system.  A full-time person will be employed to                       coordinate routine data acquisition and to manage FLBS data bases               for research use and for the needs of visiting investigators.",
