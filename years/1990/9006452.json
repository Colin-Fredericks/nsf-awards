 "awd_abstract_narration": "By killing their prey, predators have an obvious direct                    affect on prey populations.  Predators also have important                      indirect effects on prey, and these indirect effects are less                   well understood than are the direct effects.  Predation can                     effect prey behavior by selectively killing individuals that                    engage in activities that increase the chance of capture.  Prey                 individuals may also modify their behavior by adopting low-risk                 behaviors when predators are nearby. Prey such as insects that go               through distinct larval and adult stages can also alter their                   exposure to predation by altering the time and body size at which               they transform from larva to adult.  Although all of these                      indirect effects of predation are possible, the integration of                  all of these behavioral and life history responses to predation                 is not well understood.                                                              The proposed research tests for fixed (always expressed) and               flexible and flexible (expressed only when predators are nearby)                behavioral and life history responses to predation in larvae of a               tree-hole dwelling mosquito.  Populations known to differ in                    exposure to predation, behavior, and vulnerability to predation                 are compared.  The results of this study will show how fixed and                flexible behavioral and life history traits are integrated into                 an overall life style, and how this life style is related to                    predation.  These experiments will provide an explicit test of                  the predictions of a mathematical model for the evolution of                    life history in response to predation.  Because the bite of this                mosquito sometimes transmits LaCrosse encephalitis, understanding               how this species responds to predation, and how these responses                 affect populations of adult mosquitoes, may also be important for               understanding the medical impact of this species.",
