It is a                                              continuation of a joint project with                                            Professor Jean-Lou Chameau at Purdue                                            University that was funded through the Small                                    Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER)                                           program: The objectives of this project were:                                   to gather relevant geotechnical data; to map                                    ground features that are important to                                           identify the extent of liquefaction and                                         ground amplification effects; perform about                                     30 cone penetration tests at locations where                                    earlier tests had been conducted; organize                                      the above information into a computerized                                       data base; and make preliminary assessments                                     of the correlation between field observations                                   and data obtained before and after the 1989                                     earthquake.                                                                                                                                                     The objectives of this continuation joint                                       research project are to study the ground                                        motion and liquefaction characteristics of                                      the fill soils that surround the northern and                                   eastern periphery of San Francisco as well as                                   areas south of San Francisco.  The fill soils                                   are a major element in the damages that                                         occurred in the Bay Area due to the Loma                                        Prieta earthquake.  Drs. G.R. Martin and E.                                     Kavazanjian of Earth Technology Corporation                                     in Long Beach, CA, are participating as                                         advisors, and the cone penetration and                                          dilatometer testing is being accomplished                                       using equipment of the Earth Technology                                         Corporation.                                                                                                                                                    The motivation for this project lies in: the                                    important lessons that can be learned from                                      the observed response of the fills and                                          underlying recent sediments to the                                              earthquake; the unique opportunity to study                                     sites that had been investigated in the                                         1970's and 80's and where specific                                              predictions had been made as to expected                                        performance; the ability to use the observed                                    performance as a field laboratory to test the                                   latest developments in the state-of-the-art;                                    and the opportunity to generate results from                                    research that has direct value in San                                           Francisco and nearby communities.",
