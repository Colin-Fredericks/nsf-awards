 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for shipboard scientific                      support equipment for the research vessel WECOMA, an NSF owned                  ship operated by Oregon State University, and dedicated to use in               support of ocean science research.                                                                                                                              The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds               for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe                      conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support                for such items as deck equipment including winch systems for the                deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational                equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite                        receivers to pin point the location of research sites,                          communication equipment including radio transceivers and                        satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data                            communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats                  for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.                                                                                                   The Project Director, Kennard Palfrey is fully qualified to                     direct this project having had considerable experience in                       overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard                        equipment.                                                                                                                                                      The project will allow the institution to modify the coring winch               for increased line pull, acquire a block for improved wire                      handling, add a survey-grade LORAN, restore AFRTS reception, and                purchase a scintillation counter for the radioisotope van.",
