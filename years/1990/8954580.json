 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a three year program with components designed                   to meet the needs of two diverse audiences.  Program A, Update                  and Enrichment, is an eight-week, two summer intensive program                  for two sets of forty underprepared teachers of chemistry from                  the western region of the country, including the states of                      Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana,                  New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and                        Wyoming with a major emphasis on the selection of teachers from                 among underrepresented groups and those whose main teaching                     responsibilities are for students of those populations.                         Program B, Research and Instrumentation, is a three-week                        program for twenty well-prepared chemistry teachers per year to                 enrich their knowledge base of chemical instrumentation and                     further develop their leadership skills as they are prepared to                 disseminate this information to their colleagues.                                                                                                               The Update and Enrichment Program will provide in-depth                         instruction in fundamental concepts of chemistry, experience in                 the laboratory and in performing demonstrations, the use of                     computers and the field-testing of the ICE-developed materials                  on the assessment of laboratory experiments.  The participants                  will be challenged to provide input on their classroom efforts                  during the academic year between the two summers' workshops.                    Faculty from the Chemistry Department of the University of                      California at Berkeley will provide the instructional expertise                 augmented by leader teachers, both Black and Native Americans,                  who will provide the support and role models for these                          participants.                                                                                                                                                   The Research and Instrumentation Program emphasizes the                         frontiers of research areas in chemistry and the application of                 modern instrumentation.  As above, UCB faculty provide the                      instructional expertise, and all work will be carried out in                    the labs of the University and at Lawrence Berkeley Lab.                        Participants will visit other labs, participate in seminars and                 prepare instructional materials that can be used in chemistry                   classrooms.  Teachers will be encouraged to plan and present                    programs to other teachers, parents and/or other members of                     their communities.  These teachers will be selected from many                   applicants across the country.                                                                                                                                  Cost sharing from the University and the participating schools                  represents 18% of the NSF request.",
