 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oat plants (Avena sativa 1. lodi) selected for tolerance to                     rhizosphere infestation by the tobacco leaf pathogen                            Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci experience a spacial                            alteration of ammonia assimilatory capabilities between                         different plant organs due to selective inactivation of                         isoforms of the enzyme glutamine synthetase(GS) by                              tabtoxinine-beta-lactam (TBL).  Enhanced growth is the net                      outcome of selective GS inactivation.  How alteration of                        ammonia assimilatory potentials in these plants result in                       increased growth is not fully understood.  It is hypothesized                   that selective GS inactivation alters the nitrogen-carbon                       economy of the plant by partitioning fixed carbon flow away                     from sucrose/starch synthesis and into amino acid                               biosynthesis, and this partitioning leads to increased total                    carbon fixation rates.  This research determines 1) how                         provision of GS substrates is being met in these tolerant                       oats, 2) how increased demand for 2-oxoglutarate influences                     pathways responsible for maintaining tricarboxylic acid                         cycle integrity, and 3) how elevated leaf GS                                    levels affect total carbon fixation rates.                                                                                                                      Tabtoxinine-beta-lactam (TEL) is a toxin produced by a                          tobacco leaf pathogen.  It is proving to be a valuable tool                     for studying plant nitrogen metabolism because it                               irreversibly inhibits a key enzyme for the assimilation of                      ammonia into organic nitrogen.  The value of TBL lies with                      the toxin's ability to selectively inactivate certain forms                     of the enzyme.  The net outcome of this selective                               inactivation is a dramatic enhancement of vegetative                            growth.  This research provides an explanation of how                           selective inactivation of the enzyme results in enhanced                        growth.                                                                                                                                                           //",
