 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project proposes to investigate the thermal                       hydraulics of shellside boiling in a horizontal tube heat                       exchanger in a recirculating liquid pool as well as in a once-                  through feed system.  Experiments will be run in an existing                    flow loop using refrigerant R-113.  A model of half of a slice                  of a square, inline and an equilateral triangular horizontal                    tube bundle will be designed and constructed such that with an                  insert the shell/bundle geometry can be changed from that of a                  kettle reboiler to that of a once-through submerged                             evaporator.  The tubes in the bundle will be electrically                       heated and instrumented with thermocouples.  Measurements will                  include the pressure distribution, void fraction and mean                       liquid velocity throughout the bundle, liquid velocities in                     the space between the shell and the bundle when operating as a                  kettle reboiler, test section power and wall temperatures.  A                   two-dimensional, two-fluid numerical model of the thermal                       hydraulics will be developed to simulate the experimental                       setup.  Once this model has been verified by comparing the                      experimental and predicted data from this experiment and by                     comparing computer simulations against industry data from full                  scale bundles, then innovative fluid-to-fluid heat exchangers                   will be studied.  These latter speculative studies will                         investigate a variety of geometric and operating conditions.                                                                                                    This research is intended to develop new data on shellside                      boiling and two-phase flow and to integrate the results from                    two previous projects to obtain overall tube bundle                             performance.  It will pave the way for studying innovative                      designs unconstrained by past practice for heat exchangers                      with shellside boiling, and will demonstrate where future                       research activities should be directed.",
