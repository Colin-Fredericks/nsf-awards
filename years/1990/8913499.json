 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in intelligent                   instrumentation between Dr. Janos Sztipanovits and Dr. Benoit                   Dawant, Center for Intelligent Systems, Vanderbilt University, and              Dr. E. R. Carson, Center for Measurement and Information in                     Medicine, City University, London, England.  The objective of this              collaboration is to provide opportunities for the researchers at                both institutions to combine their ideas and experience to                      advance the state-of-the-art in intelligent instrumentation in                  general, and more specifically, to develop a new generation of                  patient monitoring systems to be used in critical care medicine.                One of the main research targets in the Vanderbilt University                   Department of Electrical Engineering has been the development of                generic intelligent real-time and artificial intelligence techniques            to improve the flexibility of the instruments.  The City University             has a long research history in the area of medical instrumentation,             and is interested in applying new technologies to the problem of                critical care monitoring.  This collaborative effort will combine               the complementary expertise of the two groups.                                                                                                                  Multigraph Architecture will provide the framework for the overall              design and implementation of this project.  The main aspects of                 the proposed collaboration will be the transfer of the technology               developed at Vanderbilt University, the capture and the representa-             tion in terms of knowledge-bases of the medical expertise available             at City University, and the implementation and evaluation of a                  system prototype.  The initial transfer of technology will be done              by means of scientific reports, selected publications, and                      exchange of software.  City University will then serve as an                    experimental background for testing the proposed approach.                      Results of this test will be reported to Vanderbilt University and              serve as a driving force for modifications and improvement to the               overall architecture.",
