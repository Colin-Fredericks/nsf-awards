 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed effort is focused on study of multirate digital filter bank        systems for application in one-dimensional and two-dimensional signal           processing.  The basic philosophy behind these systems is that if a             discrete-time signal is split into a number of adjacent frequency bands,        then the information in each of these bands can be coded separately.            This often results in improved efficiency in storage/transmission of            such signals.  The improvement is a consequence of the fact that, the           peculiarities of each frequency band (such as the average energy, the           impact on human perception, etc.) can be exploited in the process of            judging the precision required for each sub-band.  In this way a signal         can be compressed even if it is not ban-limited, simply by exploiting           the fact that some frequency bands are more important than others.                                                                                              Effort will be directed towards the design and implementation of the set        of filters which will perform the band-splitting and reconstruction.            This is a very unconventional filter-design problem, because of aliasing        and other types of distortions which result from the use of non-ideal           band-splitting filters and decimators.  Because of these, more                  complicated algebraic tools (such as paraunitariness and losslessness)          are required in the design and implementation phase.  In addition to its        application in a number of engineering problems, the multirate filter           bank structure is closely related to fundamentals of signal sampling,           reconstruction, and block processing.  A thorough understanding of this         will therefore unify several aspects of interest to the signal-                 processing scientific community.",
