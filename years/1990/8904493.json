 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plant hormone, indoleacetic acid, appears to play key roles                 in regulating or inducing growth and developmental processes                    such as cell division, elongation, and differentiation. Exogenous               application of this hormone or its synthetic analogs results in                 rapid changes in gene expression in seedlings or organs that are                induced to undergo cell division or elongation. Dr. Guilfoyle has               described a variety of auxin-induced mRNAs, and some of these,                  the SAUR of Small Auxin Up-regulated RNAs, are most abundant and                most inducible in elongating regions of soybean hypocotyls.                     \"Tissue printing\" and in situ hybridization have been used to                   show that the SAUR genes are expressed primarily in epidermal and               cortical cells of the elongating hypocotyl region, and                          furthermore, the mRNAs rapidly redistribute within the upper and                lower portions of a gravistimulated soybean hypocotyl. The                      abundance of these small RNAs increases within 2.5 minutes after                auxin application to elongating soybean hypocotyl sections, and                 half maximal steady state levels of these mRNAs are reached                     within 10 minutes after auxin administration. Dr. Guilfoyle has                 shown that the increase in RNA abundance after auxin addition                   results, at least in part, from increased transcription rates on                the SAUR genes. On the other hand, an increase in RNA abundance                 after cycloheximide administration does not involve                             transcriptional activation, suggesting that post transcriptional                events such as RNA stabilization may be involved. Recent results                indicate that the SAUR genes  are clustered within the soybean                  nuclear genome, and that the soybean genes are induced by auxin                 addition when the entire gene cluster is transferred via                        Agrobacterium T-DNA to petunia plats. Dr. Guilfoyle now proposes                to 1) identify the cis-acting elements that confer auxin                        inducibility to the SAUR genes, 2) isolate, purify, and                         characterize trans acting factors that interact with the cis                    acting elements, 3) identify the cis acting elements that                       regulate the rapid turnover of the SAUR RNAs, 4) determine the                  patterns of auxin and gravity induced gene expression at the                    tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels using hybridization and                immunological approaches, and 5) examine dwarf and gravitropic                  mutants for possible altered expression patterns of the SAUR                    genes and the phenotypes of transgenic plants which overproduce                 or underproduce the auxin induced RNAs.                                         %%%                                                                             The long range objectives of the proposed research are aimed at                 providing insight into how auxin activates specific genes in                    specific tissues, what proteins mediate the auxin induced gene                  activation, and what roles the auxin-induced gene products play                 in plant growth and development.",
