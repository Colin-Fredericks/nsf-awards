 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James L. Skinner is supported by a grant from The                     Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to develop                      theoretical models which will assist chemists in interpreting                   experimental spectroscopic data for liquids.  Skinner will                      develop theories for interpreting relaxation rates for chemical                 processes occuring in liquids which may be studied using                        experimental spectroscopic techniques such as NMR, ESR,                         vibrational and optical spectroscopy.                                                                                                                           Skinner will perform theoretical research in three general                      areas of statistical mechanics: 1) He will develop stochastic                   models for describing population and phase relaxation observed                  in NMR, ESR, vibrational and optical spectroscopy; 2) He will                   develop a theory to deal with lineshapes of optical                             spectroscopically measured impurities in the liquid phase; and                  3) He will use a new approach which he has named quantum-                       connectivity- renormalization-theory to study localization in                   models with liquid-like order.",
