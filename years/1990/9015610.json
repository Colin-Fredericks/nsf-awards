 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Conference on Ethics in Engineering Education, scheduled for               June 1990, takes advantage of recent interest and advances in                   course development, research and professional society initiatives.              The conference will gather 20 participants, representing                        engineering and engineering ethics educators, practicing engineers,             and engineering societies.  In discussions stimulated by prepared               presentations as well as prior distribution of short reports of                 relevant work, participants will aim to identify and examine the                core concepts and skills which students should develop from their               exposure to engineering ethics.  Conference participants would also             aim to identify effective techniques and the expertise teachers                 need to communicate these concepts and skills.  The conference will             generate a report for all deans of engineering schools and                      directors of engineering programs.                                                                                                                              This project focuses on important and timely issues in ethics and               undergraduate engineering education.  The investigator and                      participants are highly qualified; the institutional sponsor is                 appropriate; the results are likely to be of wide interest and                  broadly disseminated.  The project is strongly recommended for an               award.",
