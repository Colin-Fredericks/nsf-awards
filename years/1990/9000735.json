 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site will provide 9 undergraduate students with research               opportunities in the area of Sensor Technologies.  The main purpose is          the study of sensor-related phenomena in order to generate scientific           knowledge and to apply this knowledge to sensor development.  The REU           site ill be part of the Center for Sensor Technologies.  The Center             provide the infrastructure for faculty and students to collaborate,             exchange ideas, co-supervise students, and share resources.  The                undergraduate students will become actively involved in one of the              research projects of a participating faculty.  Special emphasis is put          on the broader interaction of the undergraduates with graduate                  students and other faculty member associated with the Center.                   Four or five students will be recruited from Penn and the rest from on          of 25 smaller colleges in the Philadelphia area.  Special attention is          made to recruit minorities.                                                                                                                                     Students will be selected by a committee according to the students              academic potential, research interest, attitude towards graduate                studies and research opportunities in the mother institution.  Each             selected student will work under the close supervision of one or two            faculty members.  The projects are chosen based on their educational            value, the scientific merit, and the prospects for continued                    involvement after the summer.  Project topics include optical,                  mechanical, microstructure and micromachining, packaging, neural                network based sensors and sensor interfacing.",
