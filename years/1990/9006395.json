 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will conduct research concerning                percolation theory, the random cluster model, and their relation                to Ising and Potts models, mainly in two dimensions.  Results to                be sought concern (1) the formation of large rings of dual bonds                in the random cluster model, which correspond to droplets of one                phase immersed in another in a special construction of the Ising                or Potts model; (2) the curve describing the typical shape of                   these rings, and its relation to properties of the function                     giving exponential rates of decay of correlations along rays                    emanating in various directions from the origin; and (3)                        percolation in half spaces.                                                          The principal investigator is working in the field of                      percolation theory and self avoiding random walk theory.  The                   problems he will study are motivated by physical considerations.                For example, percolation theory was motivated by the flow of a                  liquid through a porous material.  Self avoiding random walks                   are used to model chemical polymers.",
