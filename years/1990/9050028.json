 "awd_abstract_narration": "California State University, Long Beach, will carry out a                       project to improve methods courses in elementary science by                     conducting summer workshops for college and university                          instructors who teach the elementary science methods course.                    The project seeks to improve science education for elementary                   school children by strengthening the elementary science                         methods courses which enroll large numbers of elementary                        preservice teachers each semester.    Exemplary instructors                     and science teacher education specialists will conduct these                    summer workshops, and the participants will learn about                         recent research findings and new science teaching methods                       while exchanging ideas and forging new connections with                         colleagues.  It is anticipated that these methods instructors                   will return to their home institutions to stimulate change in                   teacher education and help create links between the science                     and education faculties at their institutions.  Systematic                      communication and continuing follow-up will take place after                    the summer workshops through electronic networking,                             newsletters, and annual meetings.  As a result of the follow-                   up activities, an array of resource materials for elementary                    science methods courses will be developed for dissemination.                    A pilot workshop will be conducted during the summer of 1990,                   and three additional workshops will take place during the                       summer of 1991.  The workshops will be held at various                          geographical locations throughout the U.S., and one of the                      workshops will take place at an institution that educates                       large numbers of minority students.  The total cost sharing                     for the project is 24% of NSF's contribution.",
