 "awd_abstract_narration": "The solar magnetic field is cyclical in time and                           intermittent in space.  The field plays a basic role in the                     formation of the Sun's hot outer corona and in the twenty two                   year activity cycle. This study will investigate magnetic                       phenomena on the Sun which range from probing the interior field                using helioseismology to studying the evolution of the field in                 the corona, including the generation of waves and the                           acceleration of particles in solar flares.  The helioseismology                 studies will help to elucidate the structure and temporal                       behavior of the magnetic field in the solar interior.  The                      investigation of coronal magnetic field evolution will focus on                 the formulation of singularities and the loss of equilibrium,                   which are important for understanding both steady state coronal                 heating and eruptive phenomena such as flares and mass ejections.               The particle acceleration studies will focus on the generation of               hydromagnetic disturbances during the flare process and on                      simulations of particle interaction with these waves.  The latter               should have application to acceleration in a wide range of                      environments in addition to solar flares. Both analytical and                   numerical techniques based on prior studies will be employed.",
