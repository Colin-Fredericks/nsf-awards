 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent thinking about ocean scavenging models has led to                        different interpretations of essentially the same data set.  On                 the one hand correlations between the Th removal rate constant                  and new productivity suggest that biological processes are                      responsible for removal of metals from solution.  On the other                  hand many anomalous variations in scavenging variables can be                   explained by a Brownian-pumping model that suggests that                        adsorption by colloids and their subsequent coagulation is the                  main process.  Field studies will be conducted to learn more                    about these two very different mechanistic pathways and                         distinguish between them.  Work will be coordinated with Dr.                    Chih-An Huh (OSU) to obtain Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry                  analyses of Th-230 and Th-232.  New techniques will enable us                   to use smaller samples for Th analyses.  The use of hollow-                     fiber cross-flow filtration techniques will determine how much                  dissolved Th is present as a colloidal phase.  Recycling rate                   of Th-234 relative to C, N, Pb-210, Po-210, total suspended                     matter and colloid distributions will be studied in the                         Monterey Bay/California Current region.",
