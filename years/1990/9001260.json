 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sedges are perennial herbs that resemble grasses, with long,               narrow leaves and small, unisexual flowers that are mostly wind                 pollinated.  Sedges have a worldwide distribution but are most                  diverse in North America and eastern Asia.  They grow in a wide                 range of habitats, and many species are restricted to particular                local environments.  Sedges play important roles in wetland                     succession, peat development, and stabilization of slopes, and                  they provide food and shelter to wildlife.  Despite their                       ecological importance, their taxonomy is in poor condition, with                large numbers of species described on the basis of only a few,                  often unreliable morphological features.                                             Graduate student Robert Naczi under the guidance of faculty                sponsor Anton Reznicek at the University of Michigan is studying                the taxonomy and evolution of sedges of the genus Carex section                 Griseae, a group of about 17 species native to eastern North                    America.  Data from the study of morphology, anatomy, and                       chromosomes will be used to delimit coherent species, and these                 will be mapped against soil substrate and geographical range.                   Comparisons with other sedge groups will be made to hypothesize a               likely phylogeny for the group, for future testing with molecular               data.  The results of the project should be a model investigation               useful to systematists and ecologists worldwide who are                         interested in the biology and evolution of sedges.",
