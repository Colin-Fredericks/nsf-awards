 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year program which provides middle school and                   high school teachers with accurate and balanced information                     about nuclear age issues.  The project takes an                                 interdisciplinary approach using faculty from the disciplines                   of physics, education and social science.  In each of the                       three summers 40 teachers will take an intensive three-week                     course covering scientific and technical content material                       specific to the nuclear age.  In addition to learning the                       content teachers will prepare materials for use in the                          schools.  Emphasis will be placed upon development of                           interdisciplinary school materials.  Funds provide for follow                   up activities which include a three day workshop in the                         spring following the summer program.  Successful curriculum                     materials will be presented and discussed by the workshop                       participants.  A curriculum guide based upon these                              discussions will be disseminated to all participants.  The                      National Science Foundation is supporting this program in                       collaboration with the University of California, Davis, the                     Institute of Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC), and the                    Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL).  The NSF                         portion of the project is $271,918 which is matched with                        $283,271 from other sources.  Thus the match is approximately                   104% of the NSF funds.",
