 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predators can have strong impacts on ecological communities,               but causality is often difficult to infer because of the myriad                 direct and indirect species interactions between predators and                  prey.  One of the most widely demonstrated predator effects is                  the \"trophic cascade\" in lake ecosystems.  Planktivorous fish can               reduce the abundance and size of zooplankton, and this results in               an increase in phytoplankton abundance.  This cascade usually                   consists of several direct and indirect species interactions,                   although the importance of specific mechanisms in causing the                   phytoplankton response is not clear. Possible mechanisms                        include: 1) reduction of zooplankton grazing rates, 2) increase                 in release of nutrients by zooplankton, and 3) release of                       nutrients by fish.  Preliminary experiments and calculations                    suggest that the latter mechanism may be more important than                    previously believed.  This research proposes to experimentally                  address these mechanisms using a series of nested, hierarchical                 experiments to be conducted in lakes which are sites of whole-                  lake predator manipulations.  By complementing whole-lake                       perturbations with mechanistic experiments, a clearer                           understanding of aquatic food webs will emerge.                                 Resultant information will contribute to limnological theory and                will be directly applicable to the knowledge base useful in lake                management.",
