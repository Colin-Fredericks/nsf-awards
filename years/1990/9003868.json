 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within recent years the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have                    undergone major changes at a dramatic pace.  While it might be                  expected that political values in a culture influence processes                 of change, there is little systematic knowledge about the legal                 and political culture of the Soviet Union.  This research                       constitutes a unique and important opportunity to advance our                   understanding of how beliefs, values, and attitudes of ordinary                 citizens structure both the pace and the possibility of change.                 The core of the study is a survey of public opinion in greater                  Moscow.  It is anticipated that approximately 500 respondents                   will be interviewed face-to-face in hour long sessions.  While                  the research team is an interdisciplinary group of U.S. scholars,               the data collection itself will be performed under the direction                of the Institute of Sociology, National Academy of Sciences.                                                                                                    This research anticipates several contributions.  First, it                     should enable developing a profile of the major attributes of                   Soviet legal and political culture.  Second, it should permit                   testing a variety of hypotheses about the origins of Soviet                     values.  Third, these survey data should lend themselves to                     exploratory analyses of the differences in value content and                    structure between the Soviet Union, Western Europe, and the                     United States.  Finally, the survey will be extremely useful in                 establishing baseline data for studying processes of political                  change in the future.",
