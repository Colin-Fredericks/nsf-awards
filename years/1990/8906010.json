 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to investigate the influence of                chirality on phase transitions in liquid crystals through the use               of optical activity and light scattering measurements.  Previous                work has demonstrated that high chirality has a significant                     effect on the isotropic to liquid crystal phase transition, both                increasing the complexity of the pretransitional effects and                    weakening the transition itself.  The project seeks to extend                   this work by (1) performing similar optical activity experiments                in a different liquid crystal system, including measurements at                 lower chirality in both the isotropic and blue phases, (2)                      utilizing light scattering as a new probe into the complex                      fluctuation phenomena which take place near transitons involving                chiral phases, and (3) investigating three liquid crystal to                    liquid crystal transtions in chiral systems (smectic A - smectic                C*, chiral nematic - smectic A, and chiral nematic - smectic C*).               The same techniques used to study the isotropic to liquid crystal               transition should reveal new information about the effect of                    chirality on these phase transitions.",
