 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a grant under the Scientific Computing Research                    Equipment for the Mathematical Sciences program of the Division                 of Mathematical Sciences of the National Sciences Foundation.                   This program supports the purchase of special purpose computing                 equipment dedicated to the conduct of research in the                           mathematical sciences.  This equipment is required for several                  research projects and would be difficult to justify for one                     project alone.  Support from the National Science Foundation is                 coupled with discounts and contributions from manufacturers and                 with substantial cost-sharing from the institutions submitting                  the proposal.  This program is an example of academic,                          corporate, and government cooperation in the support of the basic               research in the mathematical sciences.                                               This equipment will be used to support three research                      projects in the Department of Mathematics of North Carolina State               University, Raleigh: implicit systems of differential equations,                directed by S. L. Campbell; scaled gradient projection methods,                 directed by J. C. Dunn; analytical and computational methods in                 radiative transfer, directed by C. E. Siewert.",
