 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adsorption of gas on a solid surface can produce                            considerable variation in the electrical and optical                            properties of this surface and eventually lead to the                           identification of the gas adsorbed as well as a                                 quantification of its presence in the environment                               (pollution).                                                                                                                                                    With semiconductor surfaces the adsorbed gas is able to                         play a role comparable to a \"dopant\" and therefore                              initiate drastic changes in electrical and optical                              properties.  For example, one part of nitrogen dioxide in                       109 parts of air can be detected on certain                                     semiconductors.                                                                                                                                                 As the phenomenon occurs at the surface of the material, a                      high surface to volume ration is advantageous, thus                             leading to thin films structures.  Such structures can be                       utilized in a small sensor tailored to a specific gas.                          The specificity will result from the compatibility of the                       electronic structure of the material near its surface and                       the atomic structure of the gas being detected.                                                                                                                 The main technical objectives of the project will be (a)                        to study the mechanism of adsorption over different types                       of materials (metal, inorganic and organic                                      semiconductors); (b) to establish the conditions for                            specificity in adsorption; (c) to design electronic                             structures in materials providing selective adsorption                          with resulting changes in surface conductivity or optical                       reflection coefficients; (d) to prepare thin films of                           selected materials with the above structure and                                 incorporate them in a sensor configuration; and (e) to                          carry on comparative sensitivity tests with existing                            sensors or methods of detection.                                                                                                                                The University of Texas at El Paso is requesting support                        from the RIMI program for equipment for this project,                           which would involve faculty and students from the                               Departments of Physics, Electrical Engineering,                                 Chemistry, and Geological Sciences.  The proposed project                       will enhance both our Minority Research Center of                               Excellence in Materials Science and our newly established                       Center for Environmental Resource Management.",
