 "awd_abstract_narration": "Western Nevada Community College, a rural school, is providing its              students with state-of-the-art instruments in laboratory instruction.           These instruments use computer interfaces and software that allows for          detailed visualization of tissue, cell, and molecular samples from              biological sources. Physiological equipment gives the students the              opportunity to experiment with physiological variables such as                  respiration and cardiac activity. The UV-Visible spectrophotometer              allows for the analysis of biological materials such as plant pigment           extracts, and is interfaced with a computer for graphic portrayal. The          project has a great impact on students who will enter the work force in         fields such as nursing, agriculture, medicine, and nutrition in which           this expertise will be important. The college is contributing 104% of           the award.",
