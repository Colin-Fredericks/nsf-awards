 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the ramifications of the unification of the European                      Community (EC) in 1992 is the potential to create a formidable                  research and development (R&D) enterprise.  For example, it is                  estimated that by 1992 national civil R&D expenditures of the 12                EC nations will reach parity with those of the United States, and               thereafter will surpass them.  After unification, the EC will                   therefore become one of the world's two major scientific entities.              As the EC moves toward unification, a major goal is to remove many              of the barriers that have inhibited the kind of university-                     industry-government laboratory interactions in Europe that are                  beginning to be effective in the United States.  An increase in                 the proportion of cooperative research based on those interactions              is likely to alter the terms of cooperation between U.S. and                    European scientists and engineers.  For example, more of the                    research conducted by European academic investigators could become              proprietary or be restricted to participation by European                       scientists.  On the other hand, there is little doubt that                      European economic unification, coupled with increasing university-              industry-government laboratory cooperation, will result in a                    markedly richer European research environment.  While the terms of              U.S. participation will very likely change, U.S. scientists and                 engineers should be able to participate to their advantage,                     provided the nature of the evolving European research environment               is more clearly understood and provided that understanding is used              as the basis of science policy development in the United States.                                                                                                Dr. Walter Massey, Vice President for Research and for Argonne                  National Laboratory, proposes to make an intensive study of trends              toward university-industry-government laboratory research in the                context of Europe 1992.  He will (a) select a few major corporations            in key, technology-intensive industries and explore their research              goals through personal interviews with executives in R&D areas, as              well as with those at the corporate level; (b) meet with university             and national laboratory administrators and scientists to learn of               their efforts and the obstacles faced in working with industry;                 (c) spend time with key members of the EC and its subsidiary                    institutions; and (d) meet with senior government officials in the              major EC countries to become familiar with their role in the                    promotion and sponsoring of joint research activities.  Dr.                     Massey's research will provide the basis for both a graduate                    course at the University of Chicago and a book.",
