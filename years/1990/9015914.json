 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a continuation of a present GOFS long-lead                     time project to test the effectiveness of poisons and                           preservatives on preventing the decomposition of organic matter                 collected in sediment traps.  We have completed three field                     tests of this question and concluded that the best treatments                   for inhibiting bacterial activity also resulted in the greatest                 artifact in both flux and organic chemical composition from                     swimmers.  In order to exclude swimmers, we have designed a                     novel trap with an indented rotating sphere and time-series                     capability (IRS).  We propose to test this new trap design in                   Dabob Bay, WA, during fall bloom, and at the Hawaii time-series                 station.  The questions being addressed are:  1) Do detailed                    chemical analyses of materials collected in the new IRS                         sediment trap indicate that this design excludes swimmers of                    all sizes more effectively than conventional open collectors?                   2) Are the chemical artifacts resulting from swimmers reduced                   sufficiently by the IRS design to finally allow discrimination                  between preservation of labile substances in treated traps and                  the addition of zooplankton swimmers?  3) Can the IRS traps be                  fitted with dependable subsampling carousels for time-series                    collections and in-situ experiments?  4) Do the IRS and                         carousels-adapted (IRSC) traps perform suitably at all depths                   in the open ocean?  5)  Using IRS traps, can we now measure                     accurately the vertical fluxes of a wide range of organic                       molecules throughout the ocean?  If so, can these data be used                  to better define particle dynamics and productivity                             relationships?  We anticipate that this new trap will be ready                  for use in the planned equatorial Pacific GOFS experiment in                    1991/1992.",
