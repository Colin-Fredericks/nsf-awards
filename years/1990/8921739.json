 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Organic Dynamics Program of the                          Chemistry Division, Professor Claude F. Bernasconi in the                       Chemistry Department of the University of California, Santa                     Cruz will study the \"Kinetics of Proton Transfer and                            Nucleophilic Additions to Olefins in Solution and in the Gas                    Phase\".  There exist characteristic relationships between the                   structure of the reactants and the rates at which carbon acids                  are deprotonated to afford carbanions.  This study of how                       resonance and solvation affect reactivity in carbanion-forming                  reactions will add to our understanding of chemical reactivity                  (reaction mechanisms) in general.                                                                                                                               This project will focus on structure-activity relationships,                    resonance stabilization and solvation of the carbanion, the                     solvational state of the base (proton transfers) or the                         nucleophile (addition reactions) which are particularly                         pertinent to carbanion-forming reactions.   The generality of                   the suggestion that much of the structure-reactivity behavior                   of carbanion-forming reactions is governed by a lack of                         synchronization between bond forming processes and other                        factors such as resonance development, solvation,                               intramolecular hydrogen bond formation, steric effects, etc.,                   will be scrutinized and quantified.",
