 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is developing system theories for control of                  multi-media traffic in high speed networks.  As compared to                     today's networks, a high speed network will be operated in a much               more heterogeneous environment.  Many assumptions and constraints               used by network system analysts have also changed, largely by                   recent rapid advances in lightwave and photonic technologies.                   The control of multi-media traffic in high speed networks has                   therefore become a most challenging task in the telecommunication               network field.                                                                       This research is being conducted at three different levels:                ATM link, switching node and network.  The performance                          measurement, as well as the control objectives, at each level are               substantially different.  The emphasis at the ATM link level is                 placed on developing effective analytic tools for study of                      service scheduling, congestion control and buffer management of                 multi-media traffic.  The research at the switching node level is               focussed on performance analysis and congestion control design of               multi-media traffic within a space-division fast packet switching               node.  The initial effort at the network level is to develop                    simple heuristic routing algorithms appropriate for multi-media                 traffic, with emphasis on real time and high speed services.                    This project is being carried out on the basis of new analytical                methods and system concepts the principal investigator has                      developed, and is establishing guiding principles for control of                multi-media traffic in high speed networks.",
