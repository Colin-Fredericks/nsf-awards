 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent studies of international relationships among nations have           focused on political aspects of interactions.  This emphasis has                produced a rich set of new insights, but it has not been complemented           by an equally productive set of inquiries into the geographic                   dimensions of international conflict and cooperation.  Essentially              unanswered have been a number of crucial questions, such as How does            the geographic context within which nations operate affect their                relationships?, To what extent do spatial attributes within nations             affect their relationships with other nations?, and How do the relative         similarities and differences among nations affect bilateral                     relationships and the collective interactions of groups of nations              within regions?  This collaborative research project will address these         and related questions by applying new methods of spatial analysis to a          comprehensive database containing information about 120 nations between         1948 and 1988.  Matrix-associative methods will be used to develop              dynamic measures of state attributes, spatial heterogeneity, and                spatial dependence; these measures will form the basis of a general             model of post-World War II international behavior.  The model will be           validated through analysis of the development of regional alliances,            identification of \"shatterbelt\" areas of high international tension,            examination of different forms of economic interdependence, and                 investigation of regions of intense security-related activity.                       This project will benefit geographers, political scientists, and           other scientists interested in the complex processes of international           relationships in two ways.  Conceptual understandings will be enhanced          because the research will demonstrate the integral and complementary            nature of spatial analysis as a means of investigating conflict and             cooperation among nations.  The project's empirical contribution will           also be significant, because it will exhibit and expand the use of a            rich new database.  The implications of both types of contributions for         persons directly involved in the development of international policies          also will be significant.",
