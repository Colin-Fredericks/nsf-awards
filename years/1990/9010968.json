 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post-event investigation project to learn                             engineering lessons from the Loma Prieta earthquake (October                    1989).                                                                                                                                                          The objective of this project is to establish more rational                     guidelines for the detail and proportion of shear wall                          buildings for earthquake resistance.  The research conducted                    involves detailed analytical studies on two shear wall                          dominant buildings in the San Francisco Bay area.  The                          buildings were subjected to the 17 October 1989 Loma Prieta                     Earthquake, and suffered no apparent damage.  The buildings                     had been instrumented by the California Strong Motion                           Instrumentation Program (CSMIP), and substantial data was                       recorded in the event and its aftershocks.  In addition,                        building responses have been measured in the previous                           earthquakes of lesser intensity; therefore, a broad range of                    data exists to study building performances.  The analytical                     studies are designed to evaluate current modeling techniques                    and code requirements for shear wall buildings in regions of                    moderate to severe seismicity.                                                                                                                                  Findings and conclusions of the investigation will be used to                   evaluate possible modifications to existing codes.",
