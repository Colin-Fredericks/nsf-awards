 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop a software environment where             scientists and engineers need not know intricate numerical and                  programming details in order to efficiently solve computational                 problems involving partial differential equations on parallel                   computers.  The basic premise is that numerical software consists of            two parts: a core which is invariant for a group of related methods             designed for different architectures and an architecturally dependent           part.  Traditional languages tend to cloud common features of the               software and interweave the two parts.  This project aims at building           a new language based on the assertive programming paradigm and at               searching for unified principles for designing efficient parallel               procedures for solving systems of partial differential equations.               In the assertive programming paradigm, computations are specified as            sets of assertions about properties of the solution, and not as                 detailed procedural implementations.  Architecture and implementation           language-dependent procedures are automatically generated from the              assertive description.  Assertive programming for parallel scientific           processing is supported by equational languages in which assertions             are expressed as algebraic equations.  In this research, an Equational          Programming Language (EPL) system is being built to (i) provide the             tools for users to specify parallel numerical algorithms in an                  architecture-independent way and (ii) develop tools for automatic               generation of architecturally dependent parts of those numerical                algorithms.                                                                     Adaptive methods for partial differential equations use local                   information about the computed solution and its discretization error            to automatically refine meshes, redistribute meshes, and/or vary the            numerical method in different parts of the problem domain.  The                 project continues the investigation of parallel adaptive techniques             for two- and three- dimensional partial differential systems.                   Particular studies include dynamic scheduling and load balancing                techniques based on using local error estimates to predict the work             remaining to solve a problem, parallel iterative techniques for                 algebraic systems, and parallel algorithms for finite quadtree and              octree structured meshes.  Newly designed procedures will be                    implemented using the EPL system.",
