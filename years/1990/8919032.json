 "awd_abstract_narration": "The low-temperature properties of amorphous solids are remarkably               different from the well-understood behavior of crystalline                      materials.  At temperatures below 1K this difference is caused by               localized excitations.  It is not known what the excitations are                for any amorphous solid, but they appear to arise from the                      tunneling motion of some entity having atomic size.  A purpose of               the proposed research is to further establish the role of the                   localized excitations in seveal low-temperature properties, to                  determine how to manipulate or control the excitations, and                     eventually to identify the excitations in certain amorphous                     systems.  At higher temperatures, both the specific heat and                    thermal conductivity of glassy solids again exhibit unusual                     behavior normally not found in a crystal.  The proposed research                will also attempt to establish a qualitative explanation for                    these features.  The experimental approach involves measurements                of specific heat, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion, and                  ultrasonic and dielectric dispersion on samples of silicate                     glasses, amorphous polymers, and orientationally disordered                     solids as the disordered matrix of each sample is modified                      systematically.",
