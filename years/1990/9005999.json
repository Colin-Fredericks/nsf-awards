 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to blend mathematical research on the                   harmonic analysis of eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville                        differential equation with the algebraic construct of a                         hypergroup.  The hypergroup consists of an algebra of measures                  supported on the interval on which the equation is defined.                     There is a converse direction as well: a one-dimensional                        hypergroup defines a Sturm-Liouville problem and the characters                 in the measure algebra are normalized eigenfunctions of the                     problem.                                                                             The work to be carried out falls into four areas: first, to                continue exploiting the relationship between hypergroup measure                 algebras and the measure algebras that have Sturm-Liouville                     eigenfunctions as their characters.  Second, investigate                        structural questions about hypergroups themselves.  Third, the                  harmonic analysis of eigenfunction expansions will carried out                  and fourth, a student research project to develop the                           computational and graphic software in support of the first three                areas is planned.  Results of this work are expected to have                    applications to probability theory, orthogonal polynomials and                  the theory of special functions.",
