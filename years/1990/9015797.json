The network is a general                                              volume (bulk) multistage shuffle                                                exchange design using high                                                      efficiency fixed optical                                                        interconnections along with                                                     optoelectronic integrated circuits                                              (OEICs) to provide dynamic                                                      routing and signal regeneration.                                                The OEICs are designed                                                          specifically to attain the                                                      performance necessary to carry                                                  data at high bandwidths (> 100                                                  MHz).  The routing of signals is                                                determined by the polarization                                                  encoded on the light beam on                                                    which the data signal or optical                                                power is carried.  Furthermore,                                                 the circuits are optimized to allow                                             for a high density of similar                                                   switches arranged in a 2D array                                                 format.  For this reason, the                                                   OEICs will be fabricated using                                                  Ino.53GaO.47As which has been                                                   found by the PIs to be compatible                                               with very low power dissipation                                                 circuits, hence lending itself to                                               high array circuit densities.                                                   Another feature of the system                                                   under investigation is that it will                                             be optically (rather than                                                       electrically) powered using                                                     integrated InP photovoltaic cells                                               for the array elements.  Optical                                                powering has the advantages of                                                  supplying power with a low level                                                of electrical cross-talk between                                                array elements, and is relatively                                               easily distributed in high density                                              networks where interconnection to                                               remote pixels can be a significant                                              problem.                                                                        The program involves a close                                                    collaboration between two groups                                                at USC -- one whose expertise has                                               been demonstrated in the field of                                               interconnection architecture                                                    design, and the other which                                                     specializes in the design and                                                   fabrication of OEICs in InP-based                                               materials.  The combination of                                                  disciplines necessary for the                                                   successful completion of the                                                    project goals will lead to                                                      significant advances in the state-                                              of-the-art of photonic                                                          interconnection networks.                                                       Furthermore, this program is to be                                              complemented by a partnership                                                   with photonics industry, enhancing                                              our ability to eventually realize                                               commercial photonic switching                                                   networks using advanced device                                                  technologies such as those                                                      proposed here.",
