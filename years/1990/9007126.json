Most of                     the projects use an atomic-level description of the physical                    system coupled to an appropriate statistical mechanics-based                    simulation technique (Molecular Dynamics or Monte Carlo) to                     produce files containing the positions of all the atoms or                      molecules in the system.  These data files are then analyzed                    using interactive computer graphics.

In a number of applications, particularly                            interfacial phenomena, the ability to make a videotape of the                                                                                                   process is invaluable.
