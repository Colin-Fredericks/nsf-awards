 "awd_abstract_narration": "The security and the economic operation of an electric power system             can benefit greatly from robust estimation theory.  Its major concern           is the design of estimators which are robust against departures from            the assumptions, due to bad measurements for instance.  The first               objective of the proposed research is to extend this theory to                  electric power systems, which are represented by models involving               sparse matrices.  In particular, the important concept of breakdown             point, which is defined as the maximum fraction of contamination that           an estimator can handle, has to be generalized in order to account for          the local properties which characterize sparse regression models.               Based on this concept, algorithms which apply high-breakdown point              estimators to power systems will be developed.  Here, the resampling            technique and the simulated annealing method will be considered, the            objective being the development of algorithms which can be implemented          in a real-time environment of a control center.  The third objective            of the proposed research is the investigation of meter placement                methodologies which are optimal for bad data identification.  This is           indeed an important issue since in power systems the redundancy in the          measurements is very low.  Preliminary results showed that a poor               measurement configuration for bad data analysis can be dramatically             improved through appropriate measurement re-allocation.",
