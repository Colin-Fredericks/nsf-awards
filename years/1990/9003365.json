 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a symposium entitled \"Plant                  Gametes and Fertilization\" sponsored by the Botanical Society of                America in conjunction with the American Institute of Biological                Sciences Annual Meeting in Richmond, Va., August 7, 1990. The                   objective is to stimulate research in the U.S. on plant                         reproduction, specifically on the study of gametes and                          fertilization in flowering plants, by presenting current research               in the field. Emphasis will be on the questions being asked and                 the experimental approaches used to answer them. Topics will                    include isolation and characterization of sperm and eggs,                       fertilization in vivo and in vitro and methods used in the study                of algal gametes and fertilization. By inviting international                   speakers and Americans who have worked abroad, the symposium will               provide an overview of this expanding international field.                      Invited talks will be followed by an open session of contributed                papers on plant gametes and fertilization to which any member may               submit an abstract.                                                             %%%                                                                             Sexual reproduction in flowering plants has emerged as an area of               significant scientific progress in the last five years, in                      addition to its obvious importance to agriculture. This meeting                 will provide access for U.S. scientists to the latest work in                   this area.",
