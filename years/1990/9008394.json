 "awd_abstract_narration": "Representing a concurrent program as a set of simulating, sequential            programs, called serializations, provides (1) a formal foundation for           a theory of concurrent program testing. (2) a natural basis for                 applying the methods and theory of testing sequential programs to               concurrent programs, and (3) a system for reproducibly testing                  concurrent programs.  This project will investigate methods of                  incremental generation of serializations, design a regular language             for specifying sets of serializations, and develop an experimental              testing environment that incorporates these features.  This                     environment will be used to study a hierarchy of test data selection            criteria for concurrent programs, in which the degree of communication          among a program's tasks is used to define increasingly more stringent           criteria.  The criteria use information about how shared objects are            accessed in the tasks to establish the degree to which the possible             task interactions should be tested.  The study of these criteria will           include an evaluation of the complexity of using them, and experiments          on their effectiveness at exposing timing dependent errors in                   concurrent software.",
