 "awd_abstract_narration": "The diffusion of solvents in polymers is a controlling process                                                                                                  in many product development and process engineering problems.                                                                                                   When the polymer is in or near the glassy state, \"non-Fickian\"                                                                                                  diffusion is often seen.  At present, there is no widely                        accepted description of non-Fickian diffusion offering                          reliable calculations for process or product development.  The                                                                                                  broad goal of the proposed research, therefore, is to provide                                                                                                   such a description.                                                                                                                                             In previous work a theory was developed, for non-Fickian                        diffusion in the \"linear\" limit, where the disturbance from                     equilibrium is very small.  A modicum of data was collected                     which strongly supports the description.  In the proposed                       work, a more comprehensive set of linear diffusion data will                                                                                                    be collected using the differential sorption technique.  The                                                                                                    data will be compared quantitatively with the theory to define                                                                                                  its strengths and weaknesses and to enable refinements, if                      necessary.  With a sound linear theory in hand, a reliable                      nonlinear theory will then follow.",
