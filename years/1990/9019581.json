 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to develop a                               continuous non-invasive technique to evaluate the kinetics                      of film removal in the cleaning process.  A study of the                        parameters influencing the removal of a film from a smooth                      surface (e.g., film thickness, viscosity and density) in                        conjunction with the solvent properties will provide                            insights into the mechanisms of contaminant removal.  The                       results of this research will be used to test the validity                      of earlier kinetic cleaning studies.  The extension of the                      proposed experimental methods to other cleaning geometries                      will aid in a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms                       of contaminant film removal from smooth surfaces.  Total                        internal reflection fluorescent spectroscopy will be                            implemented to continuously monitor the removal of a                            contaminant film from the inner surface of a cleaning                           cell.  Indirect measurement of rate of decontamination                          through continuously monitor the removal of a contaminant                       film from the inner surface of a cleaning cell.  Indirect                       measurement of rate of decontamination through                                  continuously monitor the removal of a contaminant film                          from the inner surface of a cleaning cell.  Indirect                            measurement of rate of decontamination through                                  continuously monitor the removal of a contaminant film                          from the inner surface of a cleaning cell.  Indirect                            measurement of rate of decontamination through continuous                       measurement of contaminant species in the effluent from                         the cell during cleaning process and shear stress                               measurements will provide additional information about the                      kinetics of the cleaning process.",
