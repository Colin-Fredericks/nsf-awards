 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel pH-dependent locus ina, mapping at 48.5 min, has been                 isolated through lacZ operon fusions in Escherichia coli.  This locus           exhibits pH-dependent induction by membrane-permeable weak acids and            by protonophores, but not by external acidification alone.  These data          could be explained by the detection of internal acidification by ina.           The ina fusions will be cloned and sequenced, and the sequence                  analyzed for promoters and regulatory sites.  Acid-sensitivity of the           regulatory DNA will be tested by in vitro transcription of the cloned           fusions.  The possible regulatory role of H-palindromes, which produce          H-form DNA at low pH, will be investigated.  Regulator genes for ina            will be isolated, by screening Tn10 insertions and                              ethylmethanesulfonate mutants for isolates which are either                     constitutive or uninducible.                                                      Interactive activities include teaching a course in molecular                 biology, presenting a public lecture on the topic of women and                  science, and forming a support group for young scientists attempting            to balance competitive research careers with family life.                         This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
