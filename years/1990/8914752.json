 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Robinson proposes to study the development and expression of                polarity in two systems: the zygotes of the fucoid alga,                        Pelvetia, and the early somatic embryos of carrot. He will focus                on the ionic and electrical aspects of polarity, and the                        interactions of ions with the cytoskeleton. In the case of                      Pelvetia, he will use the fluorescent calcium indicator fura 2 to               determine the spatial distribution of calcium ions in the zygote                in order to resolve the controversy over the role of calcium                    gradients in polar axis development. Quantitative fluorescence                  studies, utilizing a video image processing system, will be                     carried out to determine the temporal relationships between                     calcium ion gradients, actin microfilament asymmetries,                         microtubule asymmetries and rhizoid formation. The causal                       relationships of these will also be explored. Dr. Robinson's                    results indicate that polarity in carrot somatic embryos is also                associated with ionic currents and that protons are one component               of the current. He will continue his studies to identify the                    current-carrying ions and the relationship of the ionic current                 to embryonic development and polar auxin transport. He will use                 antibodies to the plasma membrane H-ATPase to localize this                     protein at both the cellular and tissue level. He will also apply               electrical fields to  carrot protoplasts and determine the                      effects on the timing and plane of first cell division and the                  stimulation of embryogenesis. He will determine the distribution                of the H-ATPase of protoplast plasma membranes in response to                   applied electrical fields.                                                      %%%                                                                             There is evidence on both sides of the issue of whether                         endogenous electrical currents are important for the                            establishment of polarity in developing plant embryos. This                     establishment of polarity is the first event in formation of an                 asymmetric pattern in a previously symmetrical fertilized egg                   resulting ultimately in the asymmetric adult organism. This study               it to attempt to clarify the involvement of these currents in                   this early patterning event.",
