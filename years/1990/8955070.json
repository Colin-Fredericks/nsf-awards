 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Second International Assessment of Educational                         Progress (IAEP) will assess the mathematics and science                         achievement of 13-year-olds in 20 countries. Most of these                      countries will participate in an optional geography probe and                   about two-thirds will participate in an experimental                            performance assessment for 13-year-olds. A third option, a 9-                   year-old assessment of mathematics and science, will be                         implemented by about two-thirds of the participants. In                         addition to the cognitive assessment, background information                    will be collected from students and school administrators.                      Representative samples of about 2,000 students from about 100                   schools will be drawn at each age. The assessment will be                       administered using standard procedures in March, 1991 (or in                    September, 1990 for countries which follow a March through                      December school schedule). The results will be reported in                      March, 1992, one year after data collection.",
