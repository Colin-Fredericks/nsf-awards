 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gammarid amphipods form an important trophic link between algae and             meiofauna, and fishes, birds, and seals in high Arctic latitude                 environments.  Their success may be attributed to physiological                 mechanisms that allow them to flourish under extreme cold                       temperatures and changing salinities induced by freezing and                    melting sea ice.  The proposed research focuses on extraordinarily              abundant Arctic amphipod that lives in the intertidal zone and                  under sea ice.  Energy cost of osmoregulation will be examined by               direct measurement of oxygen consumption in a graded series of                  salinities and temperatures.  Physiological measurements will be                complemented by determinations of activity of ion-transport                     protein:  Na-K ATPase.  In addition, the ultrastructure of gill                 membranes will be examined for changes in quantity of ion transport             sites and structure as a function of salinity and temperature.  The             project will be done in collaboration with scientists from the                  University of Trondheim, and in cooperation with the Norwegian                  Polar Institute for Arctic Research.  Norwegian scientists will be              conducting parallel experiments on the response of internal sodium,             potassium, chloride and free amino acids to changing salinity and               temperature.",
