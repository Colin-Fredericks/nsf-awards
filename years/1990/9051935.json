 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences              at Florida State University to help purchase equipment for the                  establishment of a computer laboratory which will teach                         undergraduates quantitative analyses and computer literacy skills.              The integration of quantitative exercises using these computers in              undergraduate courses is a major goal of this project.  Three                   preliminary computer exercises have been developed that integrate               quantitative analyses with biological phenomena.  These exercises               focus on the global problem of biodiversity and then use the                    quantitative skills from that exercise to examine problems in                   relative growth and the size and shape of animals.  These exercises             will be expanded and additional exercises will be developed.  The               new laboratory will serve more than 1000 undergraduate biology                  majors as well as the more than 100 students in the new                         interdisciplinary major in Secondary/Science/Mathematics teaching.              Faculty in the department believe that computers should be a tool               used for the acquisition of basic knowledge in undergraduate                    biology in the same way that they are used to acquire new knowledge             in research.  The new laboratory and exercises will move toward                 this goal.  The department will provide complete maintenance                    thorough its two electrical engineers, and supervision and                      installation will be provided by a full-time computer specialist                assigned to this laboratory.  The grantee is matching this award                with non-Federal sources.",
