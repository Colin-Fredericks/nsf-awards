 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides an empirical analysis of product liability                insurance focusing on three classes of issues: the functioning of               the rate-making process, the performance of the product                         liability insurance market, and the impact of state insurance                   regulations and states' product liability statutes on insurance                 market performance.                                                                                                                                             Among the key matters of interest are: (1) determination of the                 speed of the merit rating adjustment process and the relationship               of this updating to the insurance regulation structure; (2) the                 role of uncertainty in loss performance in influencing insurance                rates, differences across regulatory regimes in the role of                     uncertainty, and the impact of uncertainty on price competition                 and quantity rationing; (3) the effect of differences in                        regulatory and product liability regimes across states on changes               over time in price competition and quantity rationing during the                1980-84 period;  and (4) the nature of the non-linear price                     schedules for insurance.                                                                                                                                        Although a substantial literature exists on recent patterns in                  the insurance industry, with the exception of some recent work in               medical malpractice, the entire literature has been devoted                     almost exclusively to analyzing aggregative data on total                       premiums and total loss rations by state and by year. The current               project utilizes a data base consisting of approximately                        individual policies over a five year period. This data base will                enable the research to distinguish changes in insurance price and               insurance quantity purchased. This will greatly extend the domain               of concerns that can be addressed.",
