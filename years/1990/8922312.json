 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although the physical principles of motion are generally well                   understood, adequate methods for controlling motion in computer                 simulations to achieve specified goals or to satisfy general                    constraints do not exist.  The primary objective of this research               project is to develop means that will allow scientists to exercise a            high level of control over dynamic models.  This is achieved by                 generalizing the formulation, generation, and satisfaction of                   constraint equations to create an intuitive interface between the user          and the computer.  An abstract definition of constraints will                   encompass force constraints, explicit motion requirements, energy               minimization, and style considerations.  Assemblies of rigid or                 flexible bodies, representing forms ranging from human figures to               mechnical linkages, form the domain of the geometric models studied.            The underlying description of the assemblies encompasses both                   simplified polygonal representations for prototyping and exact B-               spline sculptured surfaces to represent mechanical and other figures.           Numerical methods found within Finite Element Analysis, particularly            the method of weighted residuals, are studied as a basis for                    permitting interactive teamwork between the scientist and the machine.",
