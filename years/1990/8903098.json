They will survey the state of the art in              ground based snow structure data collection techniques in Japan, and            examine methods and algorithms for microwave remote sensing of the              water-equivalent of snow.  The considerable snowpack structure data             that is available in Japan will be incorporated into a data base for            the snow hydrology research community.  Experiments on the interaction          of microwave signals with snowpack structures characteristic of                 various periods during the winter season will be performed and                  correlated with the known properties of the snowpack.                                                                                                           Remote sensing of snowpack liquid content is not yet an independent             experimental technique since sensing data must be correlated with the           grain size within the snowpack in order to obtain usable information            on liquid content.  In addition, both grain size and grain morphology           of snowpack change over the course of a winter.  Dr. Decker's                   experience in the area of snow avalanche hazard forecasting--which              depends on snowpack structure--will complement the experience of the            collaborating laboratory in the development of techniques for                   determining liquid content of the snowpack, from space.",
