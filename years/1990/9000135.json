 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1982, the California coast has seen an extraordinary                  number of very large scale disturbances in kelp beds.  These                    resulted from the El Nino storm season of 1982-83, the very                     warm summer-fall seasons of 1983 and 1984 associated with the                   El Nino, the amphipod infestation of 1985, and the 200 year                     storm of 1988.  During this period, a number of the algal                       successional processes were very different from what was                        observed during the 1970s.  Data indicate that a major gap in                   understanding of the kelp forest's response to disturbance was                  information regarding the role of kelp reproduction during                      succession.   This research project thus provides will allow                    controlled fertilizer experiments to test the role of nutrients                 in reproductive effort.  An understanding of the parameters                     regulating kelp reproduction should explain many of the                         successional differences observed. The importance of long term                  ecological studies is becoming increasingly obvious to the                      understanding of disturbances of different scale and of kelp                    forest structures, some of which have persisted since 1971.",
