 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in systematic                    biology between Dr. Everett Hansen, Oregon State University                     and Drs. Jan Stelid and Martin Johansson, Department of Forest                  Mycology and Pathology, Swedish University of Agricultural                      Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden.  The objective of the project is                     to study the population genetics of root disease fungi of                       coniferous trees, and particularly the mechanisms of vegetative                 P compatibility.                                                                                                                                                Individuals of many fungus species maintain their separate                      identity by a vegetative compatibility (VC) system that                         prevents exchange of nuclei and cytoplasm.  The phenomenon is                   readily demonstrated in Heterobasidion annosum, cause of                        annosus root rot in forest trees.  VC reactions are used in                     studies of population genetics and the introduction of                          debilitating viruses into fungus populations.  Interpretation                   is hampered, however, by lack of information on the physiology                  and genetic regulation of the VC reaction.  The main objectives                 of the proposed project are:  1) to describe the physiological                  and anatomical reactions of interacting vegetatively compatible                 and incompatible dikaryotic mycelia of H.annosum; and 2) to                     determine the system of genetic control of VC in this fungus.                   Interactions between genetically defined mycelia will be                        observed in microculture chambers and responses of cytoplasm,                   nuclei, and mitochondria will be visualized with appropriate                    histological techniques.  Exchange of nuclei and cytoplasm                      will be monitored using isozyme and drug resistance markers.                    Protein products of the interaction will be determined by                       electrophoresis.  Genetic control of VC will be assessed by                     pairing and backcrossing sib-composed heterkaryons, with the                    goal of determining the number of genes that control this                       reaction. H.annosum is presently causing tremendous damage,                     especially in Europe, and all indications are that it will be                   more destructive in the future.  Further understanding of its                   biology will be of significant value to forest pathologists                     in both Europe and North America.",
