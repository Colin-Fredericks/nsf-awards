 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  Meteoritical Society is an international, non-profit                       organization which promotes the study of extraterrestrial                       materials, cosmochemistry, meteor phenomena, impact features, and               planetary geology.  The annual meetings of the Meteoritical                     Society are usually held in North America and in Europe in                      alternate years.  However, the 1990 meeting will be held in                     Australia, to recognize the growing membership in the western                   Pacific region.  Travel costs for this meeting will be very high,               and this project will help to defray travel expenses for                        selected U.S. graduate students.  The Society normally supports                 graduate student participation at its meetings through travel                   grants funded by host organizations and the Society itself.  The                high cost of travel for this meeting, however, requires                         additional support if American graduate students are to                         participate.",
