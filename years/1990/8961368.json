 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin-film electroluminescent technology now                                     produces matrix-addressed self-luminous flat panels                             which come very close to providing the capability for                           high-definition color television.  The principal                                obstacle to advancing this technology to full-color                             video imaging is the need for high-brightness,                                  saturated-blue phosphor.  The most promising                                    available candidate is ZnS:Tm, which has excellent                              chromaticity but luminance that is too low by 1-2                               orders of magnitude.  Its weak emission is                                      inconsistent with its intense blue                                              cathodoluminescence and photoluminescence and is                                due, most likely, to defects.  We will maximize the                             luminance of ZnS:Tm-type phosphors as a function of                             film structure; optimal charge compensation by                                  specific anions and co-activation by other lanthanides                          will also be assessed.  Thin phosphor films will be                             grown by conventional metalorganic chemical vapor                               deposition after a 10-30 nm seed layer is formed by                             atomic layer epitaxy in the same large-area reactor.                            The resultant establishment of a uniform large-                                 diameter columnar grain structure is expected to                                greatly increase electroluminance.  Further, this                               deposition process is capable of laying down all of the                         primary ZnS-host phosphors for full-color display in                            a single chamber, it is amenable to lower-cost non-                             photolithographic pixel definition, and it is inherently                        scalable.",
