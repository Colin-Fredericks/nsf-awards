 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will underwrite the construction of additional                     housing for scientists near the main laboratory at the University               of Minnesota Cedar Creek Natural History Area (CCNHA).  \"Pre-                   built\" units will be used to eliminate most of the                              University-mandated costs of planning for new construction.  The                accommodations meet local building codes and to provide handicap                access.  The support includes funds for housing, site                           preparation, electric utilities, well, septic system and complete               furnishings.                                                                                                                                                    These new accommodations are required to meet the demand imposed                by an ever increasing group of researcher at CCNHA.  The                        research being performed at CCNHA has expanded greatly                          assistants, 18 graduate students, 9 post-doctoral researchers,                  and 19 faculty from other institutions working at Cedar Creek.                  Almost all of these require on-site housing because it allows                   them to more easily complete their research and be more a part of               the Cedar Creek intellectual community.  In addition, 21 UM                     faculty, the data manager, the site manager, and the chemist will               be working at Cedar Creek, but will not require housing.",
