 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program is the organometallic                          chemistry of three transition metals: iron, ruthenium and                       osmium. Of particular interest are compounds of these metals in                 which oxygen or nitrogen atoms, or nitrogen-containing organic                  molecules, are bound to the metal. Results of the project are                   expected to provide an improved understanding of oxidation                      reactions mediated by metal complexes in organic chemistry and                  by metalloenzymes in living systems.                                                                                                                            Alkyl complexes of the iron triad metals in high oxidation                      states will be studied. Novel reaction chemistry of                             nitridoosmium(VI) and ruthenium(VI) will be exploited in                        cross-coupling reactions of organic halides with Grignard                       reagents. The syntheses of new oxo or nitrido metal complexes                   containing a second pi-donor ligand (oxo, sulfido, alkylimido,                  or alkylidene) will be undertaken, and the reactions of these                   new complexes with unsaturated organic molecules, two-electron                  donors and electrophiles will be examined.  New types of                        heterobimetallic molecules will be synthesized which will be                    both coordinatively unsaturated and highly oxidized. These new                  heterobimetallic complexes are expected to show increased                       reactivity and selectivity in the oxidation of organic                          molecules, since they will be designed to bind substrate,                       activate it toward intramolecular atom transfer, and suppress                   competing electron transfer reactions. The cooperativity                        between the two metals may aid in the utilization of dioxygen                   as the secondary oxidant. A thorough study of the mechanism of                  the oxidation of alcohols by dioxygen, utilizing a                              previously-discovered bimetallic osmium-chromium complex, will                  be undertaken. Finally, previous work on the organometallic                     chemistry of ruthenium and osmium in high oxidation states will                 be extended to include oxidized alkyl iron complexes.",
