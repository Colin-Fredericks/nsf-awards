 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr. Edwin                Cooper, University of California at Los Angeles and Dr. Philippe                Roch, Institute for Animal Biology, University of Bordeaux,                     France.  The objective of the project is to develop a non-mammalian             model biotic assay system using the earthworms Lubricus terrestris              and Eisenia fetida for rapid, sensitive and inexpensive screening               and prediction of deleterious effects of environmental xenobiotics              on immune function.                                                                                                                                             The earthworm possesses many components of an effective animal                  model for screening immunotoxic effects: 1) it has immunological                functions which are analogous to those in higher animals, including             mammals, 2) its immunobiology is well understood, 3) it has a                   history of use as a bioassay organism, particularly with biocides,              4) compared to mammals, it is an extremely cost effective animal,               and 5) being an invertebrate, it is a non-controversial animal.                 Preliminary work by the investigators of the immunotoxicity of                  Arochlor, a known immunotoxicant in mammals, strongly supports the              earthworm's suitability as a model organism for analyzing                       xenobiotics.  The proposed research will extend this work by                    examining the humoral immune system of the earthworm using                      Arochlor to identify how the earthworm's antibacterial response is              immunosuppressed and to understand the mechanisms of immunosuppres-             sion at the mRNA level.  Drs. Cooper and Roch have had a long                   standing and productive collaboration in studies of invertebrate                immunity and this project will benefit from their complementary                 expertise.",
