 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coupling of carbon from primary producers to bacteria can                       significantly influence the patterns of vertical flux of organic                matter in the ocean.  Because bacteria must hydrolyze particles                 before uptake, bacterial exohydrolases must assume a central role               in carbon flux from particulate organic matter into the microbial               loop.  The expression of bacterial exohydrolases is regulated by                substrate concentration and therefore may cease in waters depleted              of particles and polymers.  In high latitude waters there is no                 phytoplankton production during the protracted polar night.  The                hypothesis to be tested is that during the Antarctic winter, the                production of bacterial exohydrolase ceases.  Therefore, particles              and polymers produced during the early spring bloom cannot be                   utilized by bacteria.  Exohydrolases are expressed when organic                 matter accumulates to a critical level; consequently, the coupling              between particulate organic matter and bacteria becomes strong.                 Field and laboratory manipulations will examine environmental cues              which regulate exohydrolase activities.  This knowledge should                  contribute to the understanding of biological production                        mechanisms and variability in the pathways of organic matter                    cycling in the Southern Ocean.",
