 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Wittebort is pursuing three areas of investigation under                    the general heading of structure and dynamics in bimolecular                    systems.  They include the study of local magnetic                              interactions in transition metal clusters related to electron                   transport proteins, torsional dynamics in crystalline and                       fibrous proteins and the properties of water in solid                           proteins and related compounds.  In each case, the                              experimental method employed is nuclear magnetic resonance                      spectroscopy.  The feature of magnetic resonance that makes                     it useful is that in a solid, such as a crystalline molecule                    or a fibrous protein, interactions between nuclear spins and                    spatially anisotropic local fields can be directly observed                     and simply related to molecular structure.  Furthermore, the                    effect of time dependent processes such as atomic                               reorientation is to average and reduce the anisotropic local                    fields in an understandable way.  Thus the experiment is a                      good way to study simultaneously molecular structure and                        dynamics.  The results over the past three years, which are                     the basis for this proposal, show that the onset of rapid                       electron transfer among three chemically and magnetically                       coupled Fe or Mn ions is coincident with the onset of                           rotational motion of a nearby solvate molecule, that water                      molecules in hexagonal ice readily explore the four                             tetrahedral orientations surrounding the oxygen atoms in a                      time of 100 microseconds, and that most of the water of                         hydration surrounding a crystalline protein is dynamically                      disordered and distinguished from liquid water primarily in                     its higher viscosity.*** //",
