 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds for the establishment of a shared                instrument facility for studies of the systematics of vertebrate                and invertebrate animals.  The equipment permits automated                      analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA content, chromosome                   structure, anatomical variation, and of electrophoretic variation               in individual proteins.  The equipment to be purchased consists                 of a flow cytometer/cell sorter, digital imaging system for                     computer enhanced karyotype analysis, and an image analysis                     system for morphometric analysis.                                                    Studies of organismal variation play a crucial role in our                 understanding of the evolutionary relationships of organisms and                of the role of genetic and developmental variation in the                       adaptation of organisms to their environment and in their ability               to compete with each other.  By their nature, such studies demand               statistically meaningful data obtained by repetitive and often                  tedious analysis of many individuals.  The development of                       advanced imaging systems and other equipment capable of measuring               variation at the organismal, cellular and subcellular level has                 substantially improved the ease and accuracy of measurement of                  variation between individuals, and between closely related                      species.",
