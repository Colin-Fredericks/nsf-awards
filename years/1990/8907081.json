 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaboratiave research between Dr. Amedeo              Odoni, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dr. Patrick Jaillet,           Center for Applied Mathematics, Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chaussees,         Noisy-le-Grand, France.  The topics of the proposed research are in             the emerging field of jprobabilistic combinatorial optimization                 problems (PCOP's and in the new field of dynamic routing problems               with queuing effects.                                                                                                                                           The investigators, who have a history of successful collaboration, will         focus on two areas.  The first component consists of acontinuation of           previous joint efforts in the following three areas:  1)  worst-case            analysis of heuristics for PCOP's 2) multi-server and multi-facility            PCOP's and 3) routing problems with general distributions.  The second          component of the research will explore new directions and will                  demonstrate how the powerful concepts that have been developed to               date regarding PCOP's can be used in such contexts as the optimization          of queuing systems and the design of dynamic routing strategies.                This type of connection has never been explored previously.  The                project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the two                investigators.  Their past efforts have already resulted in pioneering          work on probabilistic combinatorial optimization problems which have            generated international interest in this field.  Results of the                 proposed project will have many applications in areas of materials              handling and product distribution.",
