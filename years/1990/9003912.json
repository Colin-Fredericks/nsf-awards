 "awd_abstract_narration": "Regulatory information is passed from one cell or tissue type to                another during the development of multicellular organisms.                      Development of the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been                   described in detail at the cellular level and includes several                  instances where regulatory cell-cell interactions decide cell                   fate. This proposal investigates the mechanisms underlying two                  such regulatory interactions: induction of mitosis in the germ                  line and induction of pharyngeal muscle cells in the early                      embryo. These two events occur at different times and in                        different tissues but share a common component: the glp-1 gene.                 Extensive genetic and molecular studies suggest that glp-1 acts                 as a signal receptor in each of the induced tissues. Dr. Maine                  has generated extragenic suppressors of glp-1 mutations as a way                of identifying genes responsible for signal production in the                   inducing tissue and signal transduction in the induced tissue.                  This proposal outlines genetic and molecular studies and cell                   ablation experiments that are designed to analyze the role(s) of                these newly identified genes in the germ line and embryonic cell-               cell interactions. In particular, the proposal focuses on one                   gene identified as a recessive suppressors, sog-1, and on a set                 of dominant suppressors that are linked to glp-1.                               %%%                                                                             The proposed studies are designed to investigate how cell fate                  is specified during the development of multicellular organisms.                 In particular, the experiments will focus on the cell-cell                      interactions that  are reguired to specify the fates of                         individual cells as they differentiate into one or another adult                cell type.",
