 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an overdeepening in the bed of Storglaciaren, a                        predominantly temperate valley glacier in northern Sweden.  In the              overdeepening the glacier is, at least locally, underlain by a                  layer of water-saturated deformable till, the glacial drainage                  system is englacial, and water pressures are consistently high.                 Here also, diurnal variations in water input appear to result in                long, low waves in the water table.  These waves seem to become                 amplified as they move downglacier, resulting in a local diurnal                uplift of the glacier surface.  Downglacier from the overdeepening              the drainage is subglacial and there are large (often > 7 b)                    diurnal variations in water pressure.  Here, peak velocities seem               to occur during rising and falling water pressures, rather than                 during the peak pressure.                                                                                                                                       Tracer experiments and measurements of surface tilt, strain,                    velocity, internal deformation, and water pressure will be                      undertaken to study these phenomena.  The results are expected to               not only clarify their causes, but also to contribute to a general              understanding of the response of glaciers to variations in water                pressure.                                                                                                                                                       The results are also expected to shed light in a classical problem              of glacial geology: the origin of cirques and overdeepening in                  glacier beds.  As part of the study of this problem, a post-                    doctoral research associate will be investigating processes of                  glacial quarrying.",
