 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on characterizing which individuals                    share parentage of the seeds that form the next generation.  By                 studying mating systems of two species that are representative of               non-woody perennial plants, the investigators will test the idea                that the best mating for a plant will depend on the physical                    proximity of mates, because this reflects genetic similarity.                   Previous research has indicated that crossing success should be                 highest between plants separated by an intermediate distance, and               thus neither too similar nor too dissimilar genetically.                             A major goal of this research is to obtain complete lifetime               estimates of seedling survival and reproduction in order to test                the hypothesis that offspring from the \"optimal outcrossing                     distance\"  are most fit.  A second goal is to assess how great                  the fitness differences are by using a complex kind of                          experimental pollination.                                                            A third goal is to assess fitness costs associated with                    germinations at various distances from parental plants.  A fourth               goal is to see whether \"postpollination\" selection will bring the               actual mating system into closer agreement with the optimal                     mating system.                                                                       These studies have implications for other plants, including                crop species.  It seems likely in general that fitness will be                  sensitive to genetic similarity of mates on a finer scale than                  hitherto recognized, and that postpollination selection will                    modify the outcome.  This research will provide a closer                        investigation of these possibilities.",
