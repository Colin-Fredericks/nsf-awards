 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sequence stratigraphic studies of the Alabama Tertiary have                resulted in the delineation of approximately twenty depositional                sequences, which are interpreted to reflect distinct eustatic                   sea-level cycles of varying magnitude.  The PI recently completed               detailed studies of two of these sequences.  Significant                        variations in degree of bioturbation, general ichnofabrics, and                 discrete trace fossils are observed within and between component                systems tracts, and reflect changes in substrate consistency,                   physical environmental energy, sedimentation rate, and bottom-                  and/or pore-water chemistry that are consistent with both the                   phase and magnitude of the associated eustatic cycles.  These                   results demonstrate the potential of extended trace fossil                      studies in the context of sequence stratigraphy.                                     In order to more fully assess this potential, detailed                     studies of strata representative of all of the twenty                           depositional sequences delineated in the Alabama Tertiary are                   proposed.  The objectives of these analyses are: 1) to further                  assess the response of trace-fossil assemblages to predicted sea-               level-mediated paleoenvironmental changes; and 2) to evaluate the               ichnological variability that exists between and within systems                 tracts as a function of differences in depositional environment,                lithofacies, and phase and magnitude of associated eustatic                     cycles.                                                                              This research will 1) provide an independent test of                       sequence stratigraphic concepts and interpreted sea-level                       histories, 2) establish an improved set of ichnological criteria                that can be incorporated into models useful for recognizing the                 eustacy signal, and 3) improve our overall understanding of trace               fossils as paleoenvironmental indicators.",
