 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray photocathodes are used in a large number of X-ray                         imaging systems, mainly in the fields of astronomy and medical                  imaging.  In most applications, X-ray photocathodes are used in                 conjunction with a microchannel plate (MCP) and a position-                     sensitive detector.  Devices incorporating this combination are                 capable of imaging X-rays with very high spatial and temporal                   resolution.  Many different X-ray photocathode materials have                   been developed to date.  These materials have usually been                      alkali-halides (e.g., Csl or CsBr) and tend to be hygroscopic in                nature.  For this reason special handling and treatment of these                materials is necessary to prevent them from degradation in the                  laboratory.  In addition, X-ray imaging systems employing these                 materials as X-ray photocathodes suffer from low sensitivity and                very poor energy resolution.                                                                                                                                    The purpose of this work is to develop the semi-insulating                      semiconductor material thallium bromide (TlBr) for use as an X-                 ray photocathode.  The development of this material would lead to               a significant improvement in the utility of devices employing X-                ray photocathodes.",
