 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every year earthquakes, hurricanes, and other forms of natural                  disaster strike communities with often devastating impact and                   without regard to national boundaries or socioeconomic capacity.                Media accounts on television, radio, or in print make vivid the                 extent of physical damage and the most evident consequences to                  life and limb.  While word spreads with dispatch both nationally                and internationally, lead stories change with almost as much                    dispatch.  Often there is mention of crime, altered patterns of                 victimization, or looting, but the impact of such events on the                 social fabric of a community is little understood.                                                                                                              Dr. Kuhl seeks to respond to this gap in our knowledge by a                     timely, sustained, and systematic study of social control in                    three communities affected by the California earthquake.  The                   research focuses on crime, victimization, social service, and                   social control both prior and subsequent to the earthquake in                   communities that differ in terms of cultural, economic, and                     social conditions.  Specifically, the study focuses on the                      hardest hit communities in San Francisco (primarily upper-middle                class, Caucasian areas), Oakland (black, lower-class areas), and                Watsonville (lower class areas with migrant and illegal migrant                 Hispanic residents).  Multiple methods will be used in the                      research including agency records, periodicals, crime reports,                  and in-depth interviews with private individuals as well as with                community leaders, agency workers, and public officials.  This                  project will create a unique data set that should be invaluable                 to understanding how social control systems operate and how                     patterns of crime and victimization evolve in crisis situations.",
