 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six undergraduates engaged in mathematical research on                     problems in cooperative game theory will be supported by this                   Research Experiences for Undergraduates award.  Cooperative game                theory is a good field for facilitating undergraduate discovery.                It is not normally included in the traditional undergraduate                    curriculum, it provides a source of excellent applications to                   real world problems and its relatively small body of literature                 is approachable and not highly technical.  Topics to be                         considered include value axiomatics, an area whose goals are to                 characterize values by sets of properties and to determine the                  classes of games on which well-known values satisfy certain                     properties - properties usually prompted by intuitive notions of                fairness or bargaining power.  Applications of values is another                theme which involves applications such as airport landings,                     traveling salesman and other assignment strategies.  Other topics               for students include studies of multi-alternative voting power.                 Indices, matroidal simple games and the complexity of simplex                   calculations of the nucleolus of a game. Ample computer and                     library facilities are available for the students.                                   Each student will write a final report based upon the                      research completed. It will then be prepared for journal                        submission, presentation at a professional meeting or used as a                 basis for an honors thesis.  A newsletter will be circulated to                 maintain contact between participants and advisors.",
