 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides a summer institute for granting Master                    of Science in Astronomy degrees to middle and secondary                         school teachers.  The model involves the use of astronomy as                    a framework within which participants' knowledge of                             mathematics, physics, and chemistry, and their skills in                        classroom teaching, are enhanced.                                                                                                                               The curriculum includes refresher courses in physics, solid                     geometry, and pre-calculus mathematics.  The studies progress                   through calculus and differential equations, and to more                        advanced physics, astronomy, and chemistry.  The program also                   contains seminars on teaching methods, laboratories, and                        exercise development.  Laboratory and classroom                                 demonstrations are featured, along with exercises and visual                    aids that the participants can use in their own classes.  The                   participants will also be familiarized with useful computer                     software.                                                                                                                                                       Each fall, the participants return to their home schools with                   an assortment of tools to enrich their teaching.  They keep                     in touch with institute staff by a computer bulletin board                      system based on the University of Arizona's internal computer                   conference network.",
