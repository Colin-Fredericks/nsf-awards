 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is a follow-up to previous                           research on the persistence of high ability minority youth in                   college programs for mathematics, science, engineering,                         premedicine and predentistry. The earlier research used data                    retrieved from the 1985 College Board files for 5,602                           students with SAT mathematical scores of 550 or above. All                      were minority students except for a comparison sample of 404                    White students. In 1987, a first follow-up was conducted. 61                    percent of the non-Asian American minority students had                         enrolled in college and were majoring in MSE fields in                          comparison with 55 percent of the White students and 70                         percent for the Asian American students. In the current phase                   of this research, the original sample will be resurveyed,                       five years after high school graduation. A subsample will be                    interviewed in-depth. The major goal of this phase will be to                   answer three critical questions: which sample members are                       still studying or employed in MSE fields, what are their                        unique characteristics, and what are the theoretical and                        national policy implications of the results.                                                                                                                         This project is jointly supported by the Studies and                       Analysis and the Research in Teaching and Learning Programs.",
