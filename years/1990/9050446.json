 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project automates the Advanced Network and Control Systems                 Analysis Laboratory through the acquisition of computer                         controlled instrumentation.  This permits the automation of data                collection, provides hardcopy records of results, and permits                   data analysis on the host controller.  The use of bus-controlled                instruments eliminates repetitive set-ups, improves data quality,               reduces data collection time and enhances analysis reporting.                   Students have additional time to explore more facets of a given                 experiment while the quality and uniformity of results is                       improved.  The availability of the host controller with stored                  data allows the students to perform data analysis beyond previous               levels.  The equipment is also used for demonstrations in lower                 division courses, teaching the techniques of bus-controlled                     instrumentation, and for applications in senior projects.                                                                                                       The award is being matched by an equal amount from the principal                investigator's institution.",
