 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between 1920 and 1948, American agricultural research and practice              was revolutionized through the creation and use of new scientific               and technological innovations.  While some historians have studied              particular innovations, no one has yet considered the nature of                 this change, or located it within the agricultural-scientific elite             of the state and federal agricultural system.  Further, no one has              considered the paradoxical situation in which these innovations,                which generally increased crop and livestock yields, were developed             and promoted at a time when overproduction of commodities was                   generating a serious economic crisis for farmers.                                                                                                               In this project, Dr. Fitzgerald is investigating these issues by                considering the role of Henry A. Wallace in his capacities as                   editor of Wallaces' Farmer, president of Pioneer Hybrids, and                   Secretary of Agriculture.  As arguably the most influential farm                leader of this period, and one who held a progressivist faith in                science and technology, Wallace was a pivotal figure in the                     attempted resolution of scientific abundance with farm parity.  Dr.             Fitzgerald argues that Wallace redefined farm problems in ways that             rendered them \"solvable\" with scientific and technical expertise.               That the farm problems remained nonetheless reflects not Wallace's              naivete, but rather the inability of science and technology of the              period to solve what were fundamentally social and economic ills.                                                                                               In order to carry out this research project, Dr. Fitzgerald will                examine, among other things, the 165 microfilm reels of Wallace                 correspondence, published primary and secondary agricultural                    literature including farm papers such as Wallaces' Farmer and                   Prairie Farmers, trade publications, and government documents and               administrative records of the USDA and its Bureaus.",
