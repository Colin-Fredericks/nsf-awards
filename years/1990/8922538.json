 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is in the general field of analytical and surface                    chemistry and the subfield of surface chemistry of metal                        corrosion and passivation.  Professor Peter Sherwood will                       combine theoretical calculations of valence band density of                     states for estimations of spectral response with measurements                   of photoemission from core and valence levels to study the                      structure of oxide formation at polycrystalline metal surfaces                  and the structure of molecular species which inhibit corrosion.                  Unique facilities to combine x-ray diffraction with these                      measurements will allow in depth understanding of mechanisms of                 corrosion resistance.  From these data, molecular design of                     such systems can be used for particular metal surfaces.                                                                                                         X-alpha calculations of valence band density of states have                     been uniquely developed by Professor Sherwood for direct                        comparison to photoemission measurements.  By using data from                   an in-situ electrochemical cell the entire process of                           passivation or corrosion can be followed.  X-alpha calculations                 will be verified with other (e.g. ab initio) methods for simple                 systems and combined for direct comparison to photoemission                     measurements.  Further verification of structure will be                        accomplished with thin film x-ray diffraction.  The systems to                  be studied are active polycrystalline metals (iron, aluminum                    and nickel) in combination with specific organic corrosion                      inhibitors.",
