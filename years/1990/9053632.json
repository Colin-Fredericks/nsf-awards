Using interactive techniques                 and state-of-the-art media technology, the exhibition will                      debut at the Museum in Boston, tour science centers in seven                    other cities and reach an audience of nearly 2.5 million.  The                  eight museums are members of the Science Museum Exhibit                         Collaborative, which has approved \"Two of Every Sort\" as one of                 a second round of shared-cost exhibitions scheduled to appear                   at each of the member institutions.  \"Two of Every Sort\" (4,000                 square feet) will present introductory scientific overview,                     ranging among biology, anthropology, botany and biomedical                      technology, to make discussion of these difficult and sensitive                 matters more meaningful.  The exhibit will offer an unusual                     opportunity to millions of people -- families, teachers and                     youngsters, to consider complex questions in a safe, friendly                   learning enviroment.",
