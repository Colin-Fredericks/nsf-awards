 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a post Loma Prieta earthquake (Oct. 1989)                               investigation project in learning from this damaging                            event.                                                                                                                                                          The objective of this project is to utilize the strong-                         motion records to validate and improve the current                              analytical methods for predicting the drift response of                         flat-plate buildings.                                                                                                                                           It has been demonstrated repeatedly that discrepancies                          exist between the analytically predicted response and the                       actual response of flat-plate buildings.  Because of                            their inherent flexibility, the survivability of flat-                          plate buildings very much depends upon controlled drift.                        A realistic estimate of lateral drift is therefore                              essential for a safe design.                                                                                                                                    A number of flat-plate and flat-slab buildings, ranging                         in height from six to twenty stories, have yielded over                         twenty seconds of strong-motion data.   Records from a                          selected number of these buildings will be collected for                        evaluation of drift response.  Each building will be                            analyzed for lateral drift using the code defined lateral                       forces and the currently accepted analytical models.  The                       analyses will then be repeated for time-history response                        using the ground motion recorded at the base of the                             buildings.                                                                                                                                                      By comparing the predicted and the measured response and                        using the system identification techniques, the                                 reliability of the existing models for predicting the                           drift response of flat-plate buildings for an earthquake                        type of loading could be improved.",
