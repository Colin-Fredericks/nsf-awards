This network                                     was established in 1979/80 to record the                                        strong ground shaking in the Los Angeles                                        Basin resulting from large earthquakes.  The                                    goal is to provide information that is                                          fundamental to earthquake engineering and to                                    earthquake hazard mitigation.                                                                                                                                   Very little earthquake activity occurred in                                     the area covered by the network during the                                      period from 1980 to 1986. Since then, the                                       Palm Springs, Oceanside, Whittier Narrows,                                      and Pasadena earthquakes have been recorded.                                    Even though these were not major earthquakes,                                   outstanding data on strong ground motions                                       were recorded.  A much larger event is                                          expected in the near future, and the Los                                        Angeles Basin Strong Motion Network is                                          strategically located to record this event.                                     Until this or another significant earthquake                                    occurs in the vicinity of the Los Angeles                                       Basin, it is important that the network and                                     its instruments be maintained satisfactorily,                                   and that the network be kept in a state of                                      readiness to record strong ground shaking.                                      That is the purpose for this action.",
