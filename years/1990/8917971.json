 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will assess the adequacy of current knowledge                for the development and validation of closed-system models of                   carbon, water, and nutrient cycles in temperate forest                          ecosystems.  Closed system models are those that account for all                of the mass fluxes into and out of a system.  For the purposes of               this proposal, ecosystems are considered to be forest stands.                   The cycles, either alone or in combination, will be examined.                   The format of the workshop will be a series of keynote papers to                set the scene and provide up-to-date information.  These will be                followed by tightly structured discussion sessions aimed, first ,               at assessing the current state of knowledge about ecosystem                     function in terms of the processes and mechanisms related to mass               fluxes, and, second, at evaluating the feasibility of developing                closed-system models.  If it is agreed that models can and should               be developed, participants will be asked to outline their                       structure, level (in terms of processes and time steps), and                    input requirements.  If it is considered that closed-system                     models are not yet feasible, there will be an analysis of the                   reasons and recommendations about the information needed to                     construct such models.                                                               The product of the meeting will be a series of papers, to be               published in an international journal.  These will include the                  keynote papers, a review paper derived from the discussion                      groups, case-study papers submitted by participants and papers on               the closed-system models, based on the discussions and                          recommendations of the meeting.                                                      The workshop will involve some of the world experts in the                 area of forest biogeochemistry.  Biogeochemical models are useful               tools for assessing the effects of global climate change on                     biological systems.  The products of this workshop will be timely               and important.",
