 "awd_abstract_narration": "Potential applications will be investigated of artificial                     intelligence and expert systems to the design and operation of                  materials logistics systems within semiconductor manufacturing.  The            United States semiconductor industry faces considerable pressure from           international competition in a time of rapidly changing products and            processes.  Problems such as scheduling and dispatching within a                production line are computationally intractible and must rely on                heuristics for system operation.  Their complexity, size, and                   stochastic variability suggest that they are best addressed by a                combination of techniques from Operations Research and Artificial               Intelligence.  Dr. Shilepsky will bring together current models from            Operations Research, scaling to reduce problem size, and embedded AI            submodules in the form of expert systems, neural nets, and/or space             state search to develop new models for production planning.                       The interactive activities include teaching two courses during each           of the fall and spring semesters selected from Introduction to                  Engineering Probability, Introduction to Stochastic Processes, and              Inventory Theory.  In addition, Dr. Shilepsky will advise 10                    undergraduate and 5 graduate students, supervising a master's degree            project in conjunction with the proposed research.                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                 provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering by          providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers                 employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
