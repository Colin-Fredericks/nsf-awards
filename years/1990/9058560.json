 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymers play a critical role in electronic materials processing,               including packaging and interconnection of electronic components,               photolithography, use as passivant overcoats and interlevel                     insulators.  The performance of an electronic device often hinges on            the properties of the polymer film used in these applications.                  Structure-property relationships are crucial for developing new                 chemical systems, formulating process models and predicting end-use             performance.  My research interests are focused on these materials              issues in electronic packaging and interconnection.  Two of my ongoing          research projects are:  1) Integrated Circuit Encapsulation.  Rapid             polymerization processes, including resin transfer molding, are                 employed in chip packaging operations.  These processes would benefit           from an on-line monitoring technique which provides instantaneous               information on the state of cure and does not disturb the                       manufacturing process.  In-situ monitoring of dielectric properties             via the use of microsensors may be a valuable method for elucidating            structural and mechanical properties.  The goals of this study are to           establish the fundamental relationships between conductivity and                structural and rheological properties, and to develop a dielectric              cure monitoring system for controlling the encapsulation process.  2)           Non-Destructive Analysis of Polyimide Films.  High performance                  polyimide films and coatings are required by the electronics industry.          The properties of these polyimides are critical in the fabrication and          performance of integrated circuits.  Thermal cure history fabrication           environment and type of substrate upon which the pre-polymer is cast            all can have a significant effect on the chemical structure of the              polymer, which in turn affects the final performance properties of the          film.  In this study, in-situ spectroscopic, birefringence, X-ray               diffraction, thermal and dielectric analysis will be combined with              microfabricated load-deflection test sites to study the processing,             environmental and structural dependence of performance properties for           thin polyimide films.",
