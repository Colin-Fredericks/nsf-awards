 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support for five undergraduate students engaged in                         mathematical research will be supported by this Research                        Experiences for Undergraduates award.  The students will perform                numerical analysis, investigate difference equations and engage                 in studies of chaos as modeled by the process of iteration of                   continuous maps.  The main focus of the research will be on the                 oscillatory behavior of difference equations and the role of                    symmetry in chaotic planar dynamics.  The program will run for                  eight weeks.                                                                         Faculty from the University of Houston (UH) will also                      participate in the program.  This will be done in several ways.                 First, the University of Houston will provide a faculty member to               work with the students on problems of differential equations and                chaos.  A second faculty member from Furman University will teach               the necessary introductory material on chaos.  Her salary will be               paid by UH. Students will spend each Friday morning at UH                       visiting laboratories such as the Dynamics Laboratory and                       laboratories in the Departments of Physics, Mechanical                          Engineering and Chemical Engineering where chaotic dynamics is                  observed experimentally.                                                             A portion of the program's research component will involve                 transferring of software, which has been developed at UH to study               iterates of mappings and dynamics with symmetry, to the PC                      environment which is being developed at TSU.  A study of these                  mappings can be made at many levels, from proving theorems in                   group representations to parameter exploration in quadratic                     maps.  In addition, UH will provide funds for three REU students                to work with the five from TSU.                                                      An active program of colloquium lectures, counselling and                  social events is also planned.  Students will be encouraged to                  present the results of their work at the annual meeting of the                  Association of Minority Professors.",
