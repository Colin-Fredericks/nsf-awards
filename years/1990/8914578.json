 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research between Dr.                      Peter P. Gaspar, Washington University and Dr. Francois                         Mathey, Laboratoire de Chimie du Phosphere et des Metaux de                     Transition, Palaiseau, France.  The objective of the project                    is the preparation and study of an unusual, short-lived                         chemical species, a phosphorus-containing molecule called                       phosphinidene.  It is believed that these molecules will have                   extremely unusual properties and that the study of phosphini-                   denes will further the understanding of fundamental principles                  of chemical reactivity, as well as lead to the synthesis of                     new kinds of molecules, including some biochemical interest.                                                                                                    As a benchmark for the applications of ab initio calculations                   in organometallic chemistry, there is a need to compare the                     actual structures and detailed reaction paths of phosphinidenes                 and their metal complexes with theoretically predicted                          structures and mechanisms.  The investigators plan to carry                     out a series of experiments to include the synthesis of a                       sterically hindered phophirane-metal complex, whose thermal                     or photochemical decomposition should form a phosphinidene-                     metal complex sufficiently long-lived for direct spectroscopic                  observation.  This project will benefit from the complementary                  experimental expertise of the two investigators.  Dr. Mathey                    and his colleagues have considerable experience in the                          synthesis of metal-phosphine complexes, including phophiranes                   and their demetallation.  Dr. Gaspar's laboratory has                           perfected the adamantylation of main group hydrides and the                     photochemical as well as thermal decomposition of related                       three-membered rings such as siliranes.  This project should                    provide the opportunity to develop new routes to interesting                    and useful reactive intermediates that have thus far eluded                     detailed study.  Phosphinidenes hold great promise both for                     the synthesis of organophosphorus compounds and for the                         mechanistic studies aimed at increasing control of reaction                     pathways by subtle changes in electronic structures.  Results                   of this research may clarify how the ideas of organic                           chemistry must be modified to deal with bond-making and                         bond-breaking phenomena below the first row of the periodic                     table.",
