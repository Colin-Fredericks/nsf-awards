 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action will enable a small group of physicists at                     Virginia Polytechnic to continue its research.  The group                       consists of two faculty members, one senior engineer, one                       research associate and one student.  The group is working on                    the fabrication of a particle detector to be used at the                        electron-proton colliding beam facility currently under                         construction in Hamburg, Germany.  The fabrication of the                       detector is an international effort involving physicists from                   ten countries.  The US component of the collaboration,                          consisting of seven universities and one national laboratory,                   has responsibility for the barrel calorimeter, one of the major                 subsystems of the detector.  The photomultipliers bases for the                 calorimeter were developed and are being built by VPI.  Other                   NSF supported groups in the collaboration are from Columbia                     University, Pennsylvania State University and the University of                 Iowa.  Operation of the detector is scheduled for 1991.  VPI is                 developing software and studying the radiative corrections                      required for the interpretation of the data.  The group will                    also conduct R&D on detectors for the Superconducting Super                     Collider.",
