 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by six U.S.                   scientists in the Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and                      Contemporary Needs to be held in Pakistan in June 1990.  That                   school has been held annually since 1976.  NSF has supported U.S.               participation in four of these years.  The school has some                      impressive features:  the continuity of plans and programs, the                 continuous support of European scientific organization including                the Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, the high caliber of              lectures from the U.S. and other countries and the broad scope of               students and faculty members from South Asian countries who                     attend.  The meetings are evolving into one of Pakistans, and South             Asias, main scientific events every year.  Topics typically provide             overview of recent developments in various branches of physics and              related fields (materials, biophysics) and the implications for the             society.  Lectures, seminars, and workshops and discussions cover               subjects such as energy, condensed matter physics, lasers,                      computational physics, nuclear and particle physics, astrophysics,              cosmology and biophysics.  The topics to be covered at 1990 meeting             include development of advanced materials, accelerator physics,                 recent trends in solar energy and other alternate energy sources,               and atmospheric and oceanic research.  The meetings lead to solid               interaction between scientists from the LDC's of South Asia and                 those from the Western countries with potential for futher                      collaboration.  Proceedings of these meetings are usually published             and widely disseminated.                                                                                                                                        Scope:  This proposal meets very well the objectives of NSF's                   Science in Develping Countries Program in providing a strong link               with LDC's to help build lasting relationships in Science and                   Technology.",
