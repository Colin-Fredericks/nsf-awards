 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a system controller based upon          neural computing techniques that can be efficiently implemented using           currently available digital VLSI technology.  The controller will be            capable of continuously adapting to changes in its environment by using         a learning algorithm and associative memory as the basis for its                operation.  This research explores the use of digital associative memory        coupled with fuzzy logic matching techniques in the design of such an           adaptive associative processor.  In contrast to a conventional computer,        the associative processor will not operate in a deterministic fashion.          Instead, its operation will be probabilistic and based upon a given set         of heuristics.  By using a closest-fit data matching unit, it will              attempt to find a relatively optimal solution via associative and               iterative techniques.  A scoring unit will monitor its operation in             order to provide feedback to the system.  Although we anticipate                implementing this processor using digital VLSI technology, investigation        using computer simulations is a first step.  A biped walker paradigm is         used as a tool for developing the associative processor and learning            algorithms.  As a result of this investigation, we intend to build such         a biped walker robot controlled by the VLSI associative processor.",
