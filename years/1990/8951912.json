 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to upgrade the Vertebrate Embryology                  (ZY 302) laboratory in the Department of Zoology and Wildlife                   Sciences at Auburn University.  The money will be use to re-                    orient the course toward a more \"developmental\" approach to the                 subject of embryology.  Specific experiments that consider gene                 activity and the differentiation of cells will be developed.                    Light and UV-epifluorescence microscopy will be used in                         conjunction with dissected and fixed tissues from different                     opisthobranch and insect embryonic and larval stages.  These                    developmental stages will have been incubated with appropriate                  stains or fluor-labeled antibodies such that gene activation and                cell differentiation can be demonstrated.  Students will obtain                 first-hand experience with state-of-the-art microscopical                       equipment and histological and immunofluorescent techniques.                    Their experience will include consideration of monoclonal versus                polyclonal antibodies for developmental immunohistochemistry and                discussion of cellular mechanisms involved in differentiation.                  Laboratory reports characterized by an analysis of their                        photographed experimental results will enhance the student's                    understanding of the developmental phenomena considered.  Choices               of equipment for this project have been based on quality, cost,                 durability, and compatibility with existing equipment.  It will                 be possible for the equipment to serve additional use in                        undergraduate Special Topics courses (ZY 498) related to                        Developmental Biology.  The grantee is matching the award from                  non-Federal sources.",
