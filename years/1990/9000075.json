 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with Costa Rican graduate students and                         scientists at two universities in Costa Rica, Dr. Owens will                    carry out a two-year field study of the behavioral factors                      influencing the migrations and unique nesting patterns of the                   olive ridley sea turtle.  The olive ridley and the closely                      related Kemp's ridley have a distinctive nesting behavior in                    which thousands of turtles gather in nearshore waters at the                    nesting beach and then emerge en masse to lay their eggs.  This                 mass nesting is commonly known by the Spanish word \"arribada,\"                  but the physiological mechanisms and environmental cues involved                are unknown.  The olive ridley is a commercially important                      species threatened with extinction because it is under extreme                  exploitation pressure from fisheries between Mexico and Equador.                Because of the lack of data on the at-sea behavior and movements                of the olive ridley, any information collected will contribute                  significantly to our understanding of this animal.  The                         objectives of this study are to (1) monitor the pre-nesting and                 post-nesting at-sea movements and diving characteristics of the                 olive ridley and (2) determine the behavioral components involved               in arribada mating and massing.  These data will then be combined               with information on the physiology of the same turtles, being                   obtained under grant BNS 88-19940.  Dr. Owens and his colleagues                will attach satellite-tracking transmitters to female and male                  olive ridleys to follow their movements.  Both behavior in the                  vicinity of the nesting beach and long-term migrations away from                the nesting beach to the feeding grounds will be studied.                       Monitoring these movements will allow the researchers to evaluate               feeding, courtship, mating, and massing behaviors prior to and                  following arribada events.  An improved understanding of the                    factors regulating the mass nesting and migratory behaviors has                 basic importance in marine zoology and potential value in                       developing improved methods for conserving this commercially                    exploited species.",
