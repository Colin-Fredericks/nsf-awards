 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses upon lessons that can be learned from the                  Loma Prieta Earthquake of October 17, 1989.                                                                                                                     The project is a one-year comparative study of disaster                         impacts and initial community recovery activities in                            Charleston County, South Carolina and Santa Cruz County,                        California.  These two counties, which are roughly comparable                   in population size, both recently sustained extensive damage                    in two major natural disasters, Hurricane Hugo (Charleston)                     and the Loma Prieta earthquake (Santa Cruz).                                                                                                                    The objectives of the study are to (1) document disaster                        impacts and early recovery issues and activities in the two                     communities; (2) develop a set of socio-economic indicators                     that can be used to chart disaster recovery, and begin                          collecting data on those indicators; and (3) conduct                            comparative analyses and develop hypotheses concerning factors                  that explain outcomes in the recovery period.                                                                                                                   Data for the study will come from archives, documents,                          community statistics, and other records, as well as from in-                    depth interviews with representatives of key organizations in                   both communities.",
