 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wood contains mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and                       small quantities of extractives.  The primary purpose of                        chemical pulping is to remove the lignin which binds the                        fibers in the wood and liberate the cellulosic fibers.  Kraft                   pulping is the major chemical pulping process used by the pulp                  and paper industry for the liberation of cellulosic fibers                      from the structural matrix of wood.  The kraft process uses                     sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide as effective chemicals for                  pulping.  The chemicals along with wood chips are charged into                  a pressure vessel (digester), and the contents are brought to                   the reaction temperature at a preset rate.  After the                           digestion the chips are disintegrated by being \"blown\" into a                   tank and then sent for further processing.  The pulp resulting                  from digestion and disintegration of the wood chips is washed                   thoroughly in a counter current system of washers to produce                    spent liquor or \"black liquor\".  This black liquor is sent                      through a recovery cycle which involves concentration of black                  liquor to 60-70% solids by evaporation and burning of the                       concentrated black liquor in a furnace.  In the furnace the                     organic materials are completely burned to generate steam, the                  sodium-sulfur compounds are reduced to sodium sulfide, and the                  remainder of the inorganic components are converted to sodium                   carbonate.  The inorganic compounds are withdrawn as smelt                      from the furnace, dissolved, and then sent to a causticizing                    section to regenerate sodium hydroxide by treating with lime.                   The clarified liquor from the causticizing section, containing                  mainly sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfide and small quantities                    of unconverted sodium carbonate, is called \"white liquor\" and                   is recycled back as the cooking liquor to the digester.  One                    of the major reasons for the success of the kraft pulping                       process is the established, efficient chemical recovery                         process whereby more than 95% of the chemicals used in the                      cooking process can be recovered.  Uniformity of composition                    of the regenerated cooking liquor is a key factor in the                        production of uniform quality pulp and therefore in the                         economy of operation of the entire process.                                                                                                                     The purpose of this research project is to study the                            causticizing process and develop a reliable kinetic model for                   the system, with the ultimate goal to improve the chemical                      recovery operation in the kraft pulping process.  A semi-batch                  reactor already designed and fabricated, capable of operating                   at higher pressures and equipped to monitor the composition of                  the main reaction products continuously will be used.  A novel                  in-situ and on-line sampling and analysis system will be used                   to measure the feed green liquor concentration.  Experimental                   equilibrium data will be supplemented by theoretical                            calculations.  A tubular flow reactor equipped with analyzers                   to test the green liquor and reaction products will be                          designed.  Such a reactor will also allow necessary adjustment                  for lime addition and result in uniform white liquor feed to                    the digester which in turn will allow stable digester                           operation, improved pulp quality and higher productivity.",
