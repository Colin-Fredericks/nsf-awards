 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objectives of this research project are the                    synthesis and characterization of of a new class of biodegradable,              phosphorous-containing polymers. The biological, chemical, and                  mechanical properties of these polymers will be evaluated to                    determine their potential for orthopedic implant applications.                  The synthesis technique involves the polycondensation of a diol,                the main component of the backbone, and a phosphate compound which              contains a pendant molecule.  The two are dissolved and blended                 together.  After separation into an organic layer, the polymer is               washed and quenced in a petroleum ether.  The final product is a                clear, white powder.  A wider variety of polymers can be                        anticipated by further changing the components and degrees of                   cross-linking. The polymers will be characterized chemically in                 several ways. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gel                      permeation chromatography and differential scanning calorimetry                 are characterization techniques that will be used. A comprehensive              model will be considered to explain relationships suggested by the              results of testing. Such factors as the mechanism of polymer                    particles release to the physiological environment, the effects of              certain biological agents on the degradation process, the ability               of the polymer to induce significant tissue in growth, and the                  degradation and eventual performance of the implant will be                     investigated.                                                                   %%%                                                                                  A wide range of medical orthopedic applications is possible:               less rigid fixation plates, joint stability with fixation rods,                 resurfacing materials to induce regeneration, and prosthetic                    ligaments and tendons.",
