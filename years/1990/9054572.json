 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funding to support improvement of                           mathematics education in aviation technology programs.  AATC's                  partner is Northwest Airlines which has pledged $300,000 or more                of in-kind aviation equipment and training aids and $100,000 of                 in-kind personnel costs.  There are three major goals: (1)                      strengthening the mathematics component of the two aviation                     technology programs offered by AATC by the design, development,                 pilot-testing and revision of three new courses in collaboration                with avionics engineers; (2) exposing students in their aviation                technology programs to \"the real-world workplace of a major                     employer of aviation technicians\"; (3) increasing the                           opportunities for women and minorities in aviation technical                    education.  Each of these goals has two or more objectives.                     Federal support will assist the college in creating a new                       faculty position in mathematics to its staff as well as a new                   clerical position to manage the logistics of the partnership                    after the end of the NSF-sponsored project.",
