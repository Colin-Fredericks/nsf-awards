 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fault-tolerant, distributed program is a program that can                continue executing despite processor and network failures.  The                 general goal of this research is to develop techniques and support              systems that facilitate the design, construction, and verification of           this type of software.  To accomplish this goal, a number of topics             will be investigated in areas ranging from communication protocols to           formal verification.  In particular: operating system support for               fault-tolerant, distributed programming; programming language                   abstractions that facilitate construction of fault-tolerant,                    distributed systems; extension of existing software engineering                 techniques and programming environments to encompass fault-tolerant             programming; and verification of fault-tolerant programs will be                studied.  The first, second, and fourth topics represent the                    continuation of investigations currently underway and natural                   extensions in those areas, while the third is a new initiative.  Since          fault-tolerance is difficult to study in isolation, this work is based          largely on existing systems and languages, including the SR                     distributed programming language, the Psync interprocess communication          mechanism, and the Software Designer's Associate project.  This                 approach also facilitates immediate progress on research issues by              eliminating the need to construct necessary infrastructure.",
