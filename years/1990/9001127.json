 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Konza Prairie Research Natural Area was established in                 1970 using replicated watershed units to study the effects of                   fire frequency on tallgrass prairie.  Seastedt and Benning                      propose to take advantage of this long-term fire frequency                      experiment with a retrospective analysis of indices of net                      primary production (NPP) using remote sensing and Geographic                    Information System procedures.  They will test the hypotheses                   that 1) fire frequency has measurable effects on remotely sensed                indices of foliage NPP, 2) that topoedaphic effects influence                   watershed patterns, and  3) that growing season precipitation                   mediates fire frequency effects.  The results from this effort                  will be combined with small plot studies to modify the CENTURY                  model so that it accurately predicts fire effects on NPP and soil               dynamics.  This research addresses an important part of                         vegetation - atmosphere interactions and is related to the                      problem of detecting effects of global change on biotic                         processes.  The institutional support for this research is                      outstanding.",
