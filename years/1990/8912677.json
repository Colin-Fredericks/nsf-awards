 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to permit Dr. Donald Treiman,                      Department of Sociology, University of California at Los                        Angeles, to pursue with Dr. Sylvia Moeno, Senior Lecturer,                      Sociology Department, University of South Africa (UNISA), for                   a period of 24 months, a program of cooperative research.                       This research project, part of a larger effort, will add                        South Africa to the list of nations embraced by a rich                          tradition of comparative research in the attainment of social                   status.  Poised on the threshold of major social change,                        amidst the continuing disparity in socioeconomic outcomes                       among Whites, Asians, Coloureds and Blacks, this country                        offers a heretofore neglected, strategic research site for                      the study of the effects of race and ethnic group membership,                   residential location, the availability and quality of                           schooling, and explicit patterns of racial segregation and                      discrimination on the social and economic outcomes of the                       population.  The project will ultimately survey approximately                   12,000 households sampled by race and type of residential                       location so as to be representative of all major racial                         groups in the country.  An indigenous organization known for                    the quality of its work among all racial groups and composed                    primarily (80 percent) of black South Africans will collect                     the survey data under the direction and with the                                participation of faculty and graduate students from UCLA.                       Retrospective work histories, residential                                       histories, and educational histories will be solicited and                      combined with other data to facilitate a subsequent                             comparative analysis of the determinants of inter- and intra-                   generational mobility within race and ethnic groups.  The                       principal investigator is one of the foremost American                          sociologists doing comparative work in this area and has the                    credentials and skills to carry out this project in                             cooperation with black South African colleagues.",
