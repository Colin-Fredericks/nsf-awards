 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a model of instrumental and normative incentives for            participation in collective political action will be evaluated in               dynamic and comparative perspective and tested against alternative              explanations.  The data are from national samples and protest-prone             community sub-samples in three countries, Peru, Israel, and West                Germany, that differ substantially in regard to macro economic, social,         and political conditions, as well as in regard to aggregate levels of           legal and illegal collective action.  Two-wave panel surveys are used           to determine the structure of causality between attitudes and                   behaviors.                                                                                                                                                      The researcher's approach to the explanation of collective political            action, defined broadly to encompass both legal and illegal behaviors           by which groups may exert influence on public policy, is innovative             theoretically and methodologically.  The model that is being developed          comprises two general motivations for participation in collective               political action:  outcome-oriented rational choice and adherence to            norms of appropriate behavior; and it distinguishes further between two         sources of rational motivation, private outcome incentives and                  collective outcome incentives, and between two sources of normative             motivation, personal moral norms and social norms.  This `rationality-          norms' model is an alternative to grievance and relative deprivation            explanations, and it subsumes other more ad hoc social-psychological            approaches.  The innovative methodological features of the approach             are, first, a `maximum difference' data collection design that affords          powerful tests of the cross-national generalizability of results across         countries differing substantially in economic, social, and political            characteristics and enables the investigators to bridge the micro and           macro levels of analysis; second, a multi-sample design within                  countries that permits a determination of the extent to which                   relationships between attitudes and behaviors are conditioned by                facilitative social environments; and, third, a longitudinal data               analysis design that takes into account possibilities of reciprocal             causation and allows for the estimation of both lagged and simultaneous         effects between variables.",
