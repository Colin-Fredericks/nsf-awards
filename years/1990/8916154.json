 "awd_abstract_narration": "A person's sense of control over his or her life is                          central to psychological well-being.  What shapes a person's                    sense of control?  This research examines the ways in which                     employment status and job characteristics; marital status,                      family, and characteristics of the home, and the intersection                   of work and family shape the sense of control among men and                     women.  More and more women are entering the work force.                        Many are both full-time employees and homemakers and mothers.                   This may cause role overload and conflict.  Compared to men,                    many women work in jobs in which earnings are low relative to                   their level of education, and in which they have little                         autonomy or ability to make decisions.  With the employment                     of wives, some husbands are taking on more responsibilities                     at home, especially child care responsibilities.  These                         changing conditions at work and at home may shape people's                      sense of control.  The sense of control over one's life, as                     opposed to helplessness and powerlessness, may decrease                         depression, anxiety, and distress, because it increases the                     will and ability to cope with life's problems.  It is a                         crucial link between social conditions and psychological                        well-being.                                                                                                                                                        This study will survey a representative sample of 2,000                      American adults throughout the U.S., measuring conditions of                    work and home, sociodemographic characteristics such as                         employment and marital status, socioeconomic status and age;                    the sense of control; and depression, anxiety, anger, and                       other psychological outcomes.  It will assess how job                           conditions as well as conditions at home, affect a person's                     sense of control.  The investigator will also examine ways in                   which work and family interact to shape the sense of control,                   and develop models of the ways in which the sense of control                    affects levels of depression, anxiety, malaise anger, and                       self esteem of women and men.",
