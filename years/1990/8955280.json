 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance the knowledge and teaching skills                     of Maine high school biology teachers through a program on                      immunology.  The program will be managed and implemented as a                   joint effort by the Foundation for Blood Research (FBR) and                     the University of Southern Maine (USM).  FBR carries out                        immunologically-based research activities, and its science                      Education Division has extensive experience in developing and                   introducing new science programs and curricula into secondary                   schools, including a recent joint effort with the BSCS to                       develop an immunology monograph for secondary schools.  USM                     has recently established a graduate program in applied                          immunology and assembled a science faculty with diverse                         interests and skills in the field of immunology.  This 3                        level, 3 year program will provide didactic sessions,                           workshops and laboratory sessions during both the summer and                    the school year for 75 biology teachers from Maine, and it is                   anticipated that the program will be continued with support                     from Maine's Department of Education (and other sources) to                     include as many of the remaining biology teachers in the                        state as possible.  Individual research projects will be                        designed for teachers at the most advanced level, and a                         partnership will be encouraged between faculty/researchers                      and the teachers to allow ongoing access to new information.                    Emphasis throughout will be placed on designing teaching                        strategies suitable for secondary school students and on                        teaching immunology as an interdisciplinary science.  The                       goal is to improve the quality of science education in Maine                    so that a broad base of the population may better understand                    immunologic concepts and so that more students may be                           stimulated to consider careers in science.                                                                                                                      An amount equivalent to 66.4% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
