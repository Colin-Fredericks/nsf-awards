 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gymnolaemates are a class of bryozoans, which comprise a                   phylum of colonial organisms that inhabit freshwater and marine                 environments.  Dr. Russell Zimmer has discovered a previously                   overlooked pattern of cell development (the \"inter-coronal                      cells\") in the larvae of gymnolaemates, and he proposes a survey                of these cells as they occur in different gymnolaemate groups.                  Differences among cell types and their pattern of development                   will help to discriminate species, and to reconstruct their                     evolutionary relationships.  The results based on cell                          development patterns will be synthesized with those based on data               from adult and fossilized specimens.                                                 The proposed project will find an interested audience among                invertebrate zoologists, and developmental and evolutionary                     biologists.  A better understanding of bryozoan diversity and                   evolutionary relationships will form the basis for research in                  ecology, marine biology, biogeography, and cell biology.",
