 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support Professor Thomas Gaisser and Todor Stanev               of the Bartol Research Institute at the University of Delaware in               a research collaboration with Professor Giulio Auriemma of the                  Universita \"La Sapienza\" in Rome, Italy.                                                                                                                        The researchers propose to investigate the interpretation and                   theoretical implications of novel experiments being performed in                several deep underground laboratories around the world that detect              remnants of ultra-high energy natural radiation from outer space.               They will carry out computer simulations and other calculations                 necessary to interpret measurements of coincident multiple muons,               of neutrino-induced upward muons, and of correlations between                   surface and underground observations.  They will also study the                 implications of the measurements for cosmic ray physics, for                    neutrino astronomy and for properties of elementary particles.                  The work proposed here will be coordinated with the new experiments             that are coming into operation now in association with the Gran                 Sasso Laboratory at L'Acquila in Italy.                                                                                                                         This support will serve to increase significantly ongoing                       cooperative research in particle-astrophysics.  The researchers                 will take advantage of the operation of major new underground                   detectors at the Gran Sasso Laboratory such as MACRO (Monopole,                 Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory) as well as other                       underground experiments in the planning stage in Italy.",
