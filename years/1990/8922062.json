 "awd_abstract_narration": "Because research on photogrammetry, remote sensing, geographic             information systems, and related topics has been so dynamic in recent           decades, the quadrennial congresses sponsored by the International              Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) have become               especially important settings at which scholars from throughout the             world come together to exchange the most current results of their               research and to plan future collaborative activities.  The 17th                 Congress of the ISPRS will be held in Washington, D.C., in early August         1992, providing an excellent opportunity for American scientists to             meet directly with experts from throughout the rest of the world.  This         award provides support for the 1992 ISPRS Congress in two ways.  First          it provides financial assistance to offset costs of publication and             distribution of proceedings within which about 600 papers will be               reproduced.  Second, it provides a means by which other federal                 government agencies may choose to provide financial support through             interagency agreements that will fund supplements to the initial award.              By partially subsidizing the publication and distribution costs of         the congress proceedings, this valuable resource will be made available         at reduced costs to scientists unable to attend the congress, thereby           expanding the beneficial impacts of the congress.  Further positive             consequences of this grant will be realized if NSF can assist in                channelling contributions from other federal agencies to this important         activity.",
