 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of separations science and in the subfield of               liquid chromatography.  The thrust of this research is the design,              construction, and evaluation of a new type of chromatographic                   system capable of separating gram quantities of peptide hormones                and other substances with high resolution.  The heart of this                   system is a commercially available, extruded multichannel ceramic               block having several thousand parallel channels of identical                    dimensions.  This is equivalent to using thousands of identical                 chromatographic columns in parallel.  Thus, the resolving power                 of a capillary column can be combined with the higher sample                    capacity of a preparative scale column.  Specific Phase I tasks                 include development of a method for dry-packing the ceramic                     blocks, construction of an entire chromatographic system                        incorporating these blocks, and evaluation of the system using                  fluorescent hydrocarbon test compounds.                                                                                                                         Success of this project will be a major step forward in                         separations technology.  It is expected that the development of                 the projected preparative capillary column technique could have                 major impact of biotechnological separations.",
