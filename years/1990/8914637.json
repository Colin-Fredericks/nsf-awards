 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solid state                   physics between Dr. Jean-Pierre Faurie, University of Illinois at               Chicago and Dr. Yves Guldner, Department of Physics, Ecole Normale              Superieure, Paris, France.  The objective of the project is the                 study of the electronic properties of Hg-based heterostructures                 grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE).                                                                                                                          The II-VI superlattices (SL's) fabricated with CdTe and zero-gap                Hg-based compounds form a new class of heterostructures which are               of great interest both fundamentally and technically.  The Hg-                  based semi-conducting heterostructures are considered to be very                important and are currently being intensively studied.  These                   heterostructures have been termed \"Type III heterostructures\"                   because of the unique inverted band structures of the zero-gap                  material; in particular the mass reversal for the light particles               occurring at each interface leads to the existence of quasi                     interference states.  This distinctive feature contributes                      significantly to optical and transport properties of these                      structures.  On the other hand, HgTe-CdTe SL's have been proposed               as a new material for far infrared detection and they are now                   under consideration for infrared lasers and optical switching due               to the large optical non-linearities observed in these SL's.  In                this research project, the investigators propose to grow and study              two novel SL systems by using MBE as the growth technique and                   magneto-optical and magneto-transport as the characterization                   techniques.  They also propose to grow by MBE and to study the                  resonant tunnelling and magneto-tunnelling through HgTe-CdTe                    double barrier structures. The project will benefit from the                    complementary expertise of the two investigators.   Dr. Faurie is               an internationally recognized leader in the area of modulated                   semiconductor structures grown by MBE.  The French group is well                recognized for its work on the electronic properties of semi-                   conductor based heterostructures, such as quantum wells, super-                 lattices and heterostructures with modulated doping.",
