 "awd_abstract_narration": "Habitat destruction and fragmentation in tropical forests are                   the single largest threat to the planet's biodiversity.  The                    roles of genetic and demographic factors in the extinction of                   small populations in fragmented habitat patches are understood                  in theory but poorly documented empirically.  To test existing                  theory and to improve techniques of biodiversity conservation,                  the investigators will develop a new method of monitoring                       population viability in recently fragmented populations.                        Specifically, they will conduct population viability analyses                   of rat, tree shrew, and other small mammal populations in small                 rainforest patches of different sizes during the first six                      years following isolation.  These habitat patches were all                      isolated in 1987 when the creation of the Chiew Larn reservoir                  flooded a forested valley in the Khlong Saeng Wildlife                          Sanctuary, Thailand, and created 165 islands.  Demographic                      changes in selected populations will be monitored by seasonal                   live-trapping as will levels of genetic variation, inbreeding                   and gene flow.  The study is novel in that the genetic changes                  will be monitored at the DNA sequence level with DNA obtained                   non-invasively from plucked hair.                                                                                                                               This study will contribute to our basic understanding of                        evolutionary biology and ecology in a number of ways.  It will                  provide among the first sequence-level data on variation in a                   number of nuclear and mitochondrial genes in several free-                      ranging mammal species.  It will also provide one of the first                  cases where both genetic and ecological aspects of population                   viability are monitored in the critical first 20 generations                    following insularization.  In addition, the study promises to                   contribute to conservation biology in three significant ways.                   First, the development of the genetic monitoring technique                      based on non-invasive sampling of DNA from hair will have wide                  applicability.  Second, the demonstration that population                       viability can be monitored in common small mammals should lead                  to improved management practices for rarer and more endangered                  species.  Finally, the lessons learned from this study in Thai                  forest fragments should be applicable to biodiversity                           conservation elsewhere in the tropics.",
