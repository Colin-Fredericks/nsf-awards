 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowledge of modern optics is increasingly important to                    workers in many areas of science and technology.  Accordingly,                  the University of Oregon Physics Department has committed                       itself to the development of a strong program of research and                   education in the fields of optics and optical physics.  Over                    the last two years, three tenure-level faculty members                          specializing in various aspects of optical physics have been                    added to the Department.  An integral part of the new program                   is the development of an undergraduate teaching laboratory                      specializing in modern optics, optical technology, and                          spectroscopy.  The ten experiments, of which the laboratory is                  composed, have been designed and will be taught by faculty                      actively involved in optics research.  Equipment specified is                   almost without exception of the same type that is actually                      found in real research and development laboratories engaged in                  optics related work.  Students successfully completing the                      course will have acquired not only a wide knowledge of the                      principles of optics but will also be well versed in the                        practice of optics.  They will also gain exposure to simple yet                 important techniques such as the representation of physical                     processes on oscilloscopes, and the computer control of                         laboratory apparatus.",
