 "awd_abstract_narration": "This one year project, sponsored by the University of Wisconsin                 Madison and called the Assessment and Coordination of Math and                  Science Related Industrial Internship Programs for Secondary                    School Teachers, is a program to place 20 outstanding science                   teachers of minority students in internships in local businesses                and industries so that they will have an opportunity to                         experience actually doing science and technology. The intern                    program is supplemented by lectures on science and there are                    follow-through projects to aid in the implementation of the                     summer experience in the classroom.  Altogether the teachers will               spend eight weeks during the summer in lectures and at work.                    Because the academic/industrial internship model has been so                    successful and holds such great promise for the future, the                     University proposes to expand the teacher/internship experience                 by working to replicate the program on a national basis.  A                     national teachers/internship program planning conference will be                organized to find out the nature of support for expanding the                   project into a nation-wide effort.                                                                                                                              The NSF share of the project cost is $109,580 which is being                    matched by $145,000 from other sources.  This is a cost share of                more than 132%.",
