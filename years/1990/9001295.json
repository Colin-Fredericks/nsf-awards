 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mixing rate problems concern the rate of convergence in                    distribution of a Markov process to its stationary distribution.                The motivation for this research is Monte Carlo sampling from a                 complicated combinatorial object X.  If one can construct a                     process with state space X and stationary distribution uniform                  on X, and if one can show that the process converges in                         distribution to that stationary distribution rather rapidly, the                simulation of the process allows simulation of points nearly                    uniformly distributed in X.  This technique can give accurate                   polynomial-time probabilistic approximations to                                 problems.  This research will focus first on two cases of this                  kind of problem.  This first is generating a point at random                    from a convex polytope.  The second is generating a random                      sample path of a self-avoiding random walk.  Covering problems                  concern the time taken by a stochastic process to visit all of                  the collection of subsets of its state space.  Typically the                    process is a random walk on a finite graph, and interest is in                  the time taken to visit all vertices.  This work will concentrate               on aspects of covering times other than bounds on expected                      values, particularly tail probabilities.",
