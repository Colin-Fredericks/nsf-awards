 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will focus on using a state transition formalism                   that is mathematically rigorous, yet easily accessible to the                   average engineer for the analysis and synthesis of network                      protocols.  Building on past work in which the principal                        investigator has developed rudiments of a theory for                            communication network protocols, this research will develop a                   broad theoretical foundation, investigate sound and efficient                   methods for protocol analysis and synthesis, and apply these                    methods to the design of protocols.                                                  The analysis of protocols will address two kinds of                        concerns: logical properties and quantitative performance.                      Logical properties have to do with the functional requirements of               a protocol and are determined by the reachable states and                       \"allowed behaviors\" of the protocol.  The concerns formalized as                logical properties include safety, progress, and real-time                      progress.                                                                            Concerns that still need to be formalized included secrecy,                authenticity, anonymity, privacy, and accessibility. Quantitative               performance has to do with the throughput and response time                     characteristics of a protocol.  Quantitative measures such as                   probability distributions or time bounds will be introduced into                the state transition formalism.                                                      In addition, the research will include the development of                  methods for protocol construction by refinement and composition                 techniques for deriving protocol converters and adapters, as well               as for maintaining and modifying network protocols in a changing                environment.",
