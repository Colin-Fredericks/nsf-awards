 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research will allow a cultural anthropologist                 to study how cooperative ideologies and political entrepreneurs                 function in agro-pastoral communities in the Andes mountains of                 Peru.  The theory to be addressed deals with collective action on               common property, and the focus of the research is to see how                    individual decision making yields cooperative collective                        outcomes.  Methods include participant observation, agricultural                surveys, key informant interviewing, participant-observation of                 work groups, and household surveys.                                                                                                                             This research is important because simplistic models of the                     \"tragedy of the commons\" have been widely publicized, and have                  led to an erroneous understanding of how actual commons are                     managed by real communities.  Studies of the actual collective                  management of common property will give models for understanding                how to sustain environmental processes in controlled access                     common property.",
