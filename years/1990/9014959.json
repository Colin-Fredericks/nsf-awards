 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Mas-                    sachusetts, will support seven U.S. graduate students who have                  been accepted in the Young Scientists' Program at the International             Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Vienna, Austria,              during the summer of 1990.  IIASA is a non-governmental, multi-                 lateral research organization whose research is supported by                    national member organizations (NMOs) from 16 countries, including               the United States, Canada, Japan, the Soviet Union, and most major              Eastern and Western European countries.  The U.S. NMO is comprised              of approximately 20 organizations and is chaired by the American                Academy.  IIASA's research programs deal with the behavior of                   large scale systems and include projects in environmental science,              population and demography, and economic change.  The Young                      Scientists' Program allows graduate students from member countries              to spend a summer at IIASA, working in the ongoing research                     projects of permanent and visiting senior scientists.  A multi-                 lateral IIASA committee selects Young Scientists on the basis of                applications forwarded by the respective NMOs, paying particular                attention to the likelihood that candidates can make substantial                contributions to the research conducted at the Institute.  Each                 NMO then seeks support for the candidates from its country who                  have been selected by IIASA.                                                                                                                                    Current political and economic changes are having important                     effects on the conduct of science and engineering research in                   Europe and are almost certain to influence future U.S. participation            in European research activities.  Of particular interest are: a)                the movement toward multilateral research as exemplified by                     European Community programs and renewed interest in existing                    multinational centers such as IIASA; b) the opening of Eastern                  Europe which is resulting in increased mobility for scientists                  from those countries and is facilitating access to their research               sites on the part of Western investigators; and c) acknowledgment               by Eastern European countries of the urgent need for research                   related to their severe environmental problems.  In view of the                 rapidly changing European research context, it is important for                 young U.S. investigators to gain working experience in Europe                   early in their careers and to meet and interact with their                      European peers with the expectation that life-long professional                 bonds can ensue.                                                                                                                                                NSF's support for U.S. participation in the IIASA Young Scientists'             Program provides a cost-effective investment in the future,                     internationally-oriented careers of an outstanding group of U.S.                graduate students by: a) giving them working experience in an                   important multilateral research organization; b) providing                      opportunities for interactions on a sustained basis with senior                 scientists and students from all over Europe; and c) involving                  them in critically important areas of research, such as environme-              ntal science and the economic restructuring of Eastern Europe and               the Soviet Union.",
