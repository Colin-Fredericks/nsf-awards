 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Dr. Patrick S. Mariano at the University of                  Maryland.  Knowledge gained from this research will lead to a                   more sound understanding of chemical reactions that occur                       through the intermediacy of charged species generated by the                    interaction of organic molecules with light.  In addition, the                  investigator will develop new photochemical reactions of                        potential use in the synthesis of organic chemicals.                                                                                                            The experiments that will be carried out by Dr. Mariano are                     designed to provide information about the mechanistic course of                 excited-state single-electron-transfer processes and about the                  influence of structural and environmental factors on the                        efficiencies of these reactions.  Fast kinetic measurements                     will be used to determine rates of important solution-phase ion                 radical processes, which serve as the driving force for a                       number of important ground-state and excited-state                              single-electron-transfer processes.  Exploratory work will be                   aimed at discovery of new, synthetically useful                                 single-electron-transfer reactions and related electrochemical                  reactions of donor-acceptor systems.  Biochemically relevant                    photochemical single-electron-transfer reactions will be used                   to model those involved in the redox chemistry of flavoproteins.",
