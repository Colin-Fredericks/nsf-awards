 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project proposes to utilize digital image                       processing of NASA - supplied planetary images as a medium                      for a 4-week teacher enhancement project for 72 science                         teachers from Arizona and New Mexico.  Modern digital image                     processing, developed largely by the planetary exploration                      program, offers revolutionary new ways to interact with                         visual information, and recent advances make this capability                    available at moderate cost.  A summer program for secondary                     and middle school teachers, run through the Regional                            Planetary Imaging Facility, will introduce them to the                          technology, to related cognitive issues, and to advances in                     planetary science.  Participants will return to their schools                   with a hardware and software package, with skills, and with                     sample activity units , that will enable them to incorporate                    digital image processing into their students' programs.  The                    project's staff will support that implementation through on-                    site follow-up visits and continual communication to maintain                   the systems, to help with program development, and to assess                    progress for incorporation of new ideas into subsequent                         summers' courses.  This program is expected to promote                          through budgetary structure, recruitment of teacher                             participants, and the cognitive thrust of the program itself.                   It will support visual modes of learning that can complement                    verbal communication.                                                                                                                                           An amount equivalent to 66.4% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.",
