 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biological Sciences              at George Washington University to help purchase equipment that                 will allow redesign of two undergraduate physiology human                       laboratories around microcomputer-based work stations.  Apple                   Macintosh SE personal computers will be interfaced with World                   Precision Instruments MacLab data acquisition systems.  The WPI                 MacLab includes both the necessary hardware and software                        specifically designed to emulate a polygraph and a storage                      oscilloscope.  The most innovative feature of the redesigned labs               will be that PCs will be used as interactive \"electronic lab                    manuals\".  The software which will be designed for the manual will              make possible an auto-tutorial approach which will greatly improve              learning during the conduct of an exercise.  In responding to                   queries, students will be required to answer questions, provide                 data, or produce graphical or tabular data summaries.  The PC-based             work stations will also allow the addition of new lab exercises to              the curriculum, including simulations.  The proposed PC-based work              stations will be less expensive to purchase and much easier to use              and maintain than high quality pen and ink recording systems.  No               laboratory courses in the Department currently provide students an              opportunity to use PC's regularly for data acquisition and                      analysis.  Using PC-based work stations in physiology will better               prepare students to enter the work force or to continue their                   education at the graduate level.  The grantee is matching this                  award with non-Federal sources.",
