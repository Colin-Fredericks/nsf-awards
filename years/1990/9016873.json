A major class of existing structures                   identified as posing one of the greatest seismic hazards are                    nonductile concrete frames.  A number of strengthening                          techniques for concrete frames include addition of structural                   walls, addition of steel bracing, and enlarging of columns and                  beams using reinforced concrete jackets.  An alternative                        approach to concrete jackets is the use of external steel                       jackets and plates attached to the existing members.  Steel                     jackets may offer significant advantages of reduced labor,                      reduced cost, and reduced disruption to existing facilities,                    as compare to the use of concrete jackets.                                                                                                                      The proposed research program will investigate critical issues                  associated with the use of external steel jackets and plates                    for strengthening nonductile concrete frames.  The project                      consists of a number of interrelated tests, divided into three                  major phases:                                                                   I - behavior of steel-to-concrete connections; II - behavior                    of individual members strengthened with steel jackets; and III                  - behavior of beam-column subassemblages strengthened with                      steel jackets.  The overall objective of the project is to                      develop design guidelines for the effective implementation of                   steel jackets as a strengthening and repair technique.                                                                                                          This project is one part of a collaborative research activity                   involving an academic institution and two professional                          engineering offices in a common effort to implement research                    results into practice.",
