 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many environments, the richer the environment, the fewer                species it can support.  This is true at least in lakes, tropical               forest, semi-arid plains and mountainsides, and oceans.  It is                  true of trees and other vegetation, terrestrial mammals, and                    various kinds of aquatic invertebrates.  No general explanation                 for it has yet been proved.  However, preservation of the world's               species requires an understanding of the mechanisms which                       regulates the number of species in natural environments.                             This research will test two hypotheses in the field.  1) Do                other forms of life usurp the resources of a given form as                      production rises?  For example, does the number of mammal species               decline because birds and ants take their food?  2) Does the                    habitat become simpler, costing some specialists their livelihood               as production rises?  For example, does the variety of                          architectural forms found among plants diminish, causing the loss               of some mammal species?                                                              In one set of experiments, the rate at which seeds become                  available to mammals (but not birds or ants) will be doubled.  In               another set, in a fairly uniform grassland, the patchiness will                 be increased by removing small areas of grass.  Small mammals                   will be censused and the natural rate at which they remove seeds                from the environment will be measured.                                               Results for this 4-year project will be of immediate                       interest to basic ecologists as a test of general theory.                       Findings will also be valuable to scientists developing                         strategies of bioconservation.",
