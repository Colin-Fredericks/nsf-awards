 "awd_abstract_narration": "The regulation of cell number and, more specifically, neuron                    number in the developing CNS is a largely unexplored question.                  Investigators will examine this issue in the developing dentate                 gyrus of the mouse.  Within the dentate gyrus of a single inbred                strain of mice the number of granule cells is similar from animal               to animal (of the same sex), but this number varies markedly in                 different inbred strains.  This project has two specific aims.                  First, investigators will examine changes in cell proliferation                 during the period of cell proliferation in the normal mouse.                    Second, investigators will determine the relative contribution of               cell production and cell death to the variable numbers of granule               cells in two inbred stains which have significantly different                   numbers of granule cells in the adult.  Three aspects of cell                   production will be measured:  1) the period of time during which                neurons are produced, 2) the length of the cell cycle of the                    proliferative population, 3) the proportion of cell that leave                  the proliferative population during each cycle (i.e., leaving                   fraction).  These measurements will be used to estimate the size                of the proliferative population at the beginning of the period of               neuron generation for the dentate gyrus granule cells.  The major               methods to be used are bromodeoxyuridine immunohistochemistry and               tritiated thymidine autoradiography both alone and in a series of               double labeling experiments. In addition, the role of cell death                in producing these differences in cell numbers will be assessed                 using a silver degeneration method, immunohistochemical detection               of Alz-50 (a newly developed marker for naturally occurring                     neuronal death) and analysis of differential and non-differential               survival of BUdR labeled cells.",
