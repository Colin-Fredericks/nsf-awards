 "awd_abstract_narration": "The decay rate of a particular mRNA can greatly influence the                   amount of protein produced from that message and can thereby play               an important role in the overall regulation of gene expression.                 The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which                cells degrade messenger RNA molecules and are able to regulate                  this decay process.  The proposed experiments will determine the                mechanism by which the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase                (cat) message is degraded and how the stability of this message                 is regulated in response to culture growth conditions.  Three                   cleavage sites have been detected within the cat message that may               be involved in initiating the decay process.  These cleavage                    sites will be mapped, and the importance of these cleavages to                  the decay process will be determined by deletion and                            site-directed mutagenesis and by gene fusion analyses.  An in                   vitro message degradation assay will be used to study the decay                 process and to eventually purify the ribonucleases involved in                  these degradative events.  Changes in the stability of the cat                  message in response to non-steady state growth conditions and                   medium composition will also be measured and compared to other                  messages such as ompA, bla, lpp, lac, and trxA.  The results of                 these experiments will define the important components of the cat               message decay pathway, which should be broadly applicable to                    other messages in E. coli, and will be lend insight into how                    message stability is regulated in response to culture growth                    conditions.",
