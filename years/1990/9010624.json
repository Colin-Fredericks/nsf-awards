 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the benefit of non-intrusive mechanisms for               distributing load and status information in a distributed memory                multicomputer.  To benefit from the possible speedup of parallel                computers, programs must be partitioned into units that work in                 parallel.  Once partitioned, these units, must be assigned to specific          processors for execution.  On distributed memory multicomputers, this           is called load distribution, in comparison to rearranging extant                tasks, termed load redistribution.  In previous work, program traces            from small-grain programs were simulated on a reference architecture,           using a modern network architecture.  The interconnection network did           not require strong communication locality because messages could                quickly cut-through intermediate nodes, favoring simple process                 distribution strategies.  In this project, the reference architecture           is augmented by firmware mechanisms for non-intrusive load information          distribution.  This information was shown to be critical for process            distribution; these mechanisms are also useful for process                      synchronization and network resource reservation.  For the previous             sample programs, there was little advantage to processor                        redistribution; this study will determine if this is true for parallel          numerical applications by instrumentation and measurement of those              programs and comparison to current and expected system performance.",
