 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate computer facility is being equipped to improve                laboratory experiences and enhance independent undergraduate                    research. Student interested in perceptual phenomena were                       previously limited to investigating visual phenomena. With the                  acquisition of new equipment, students are now able to                          investigate a wide range of auditory phenomena as well, including               voice identification, speech and music analysis, and pitch                      discrimination. The equipment is a combination of a McIntosh                    computer, Farallon's MacRecorder and MacLaboratory. Students can                store sound stimuli in digitized form within the computer and                   then analyze or manipulate the sounds. They can conduct auditory                discrimination experiments as well as a variety of other                        cognitive experiments. The equipment is being used in a number of               courses, but predominantly in the sensation and perception                      course, the experimental methodology course, and independent                    undergraduate research. Demonstrations and auditory experiments                 resulting from this project will have a large pedagogical impact                on other institutions which lack sophisticated audition                         laboratories. The college will contribute an amount equal to the                award.",
