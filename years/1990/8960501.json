 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a SBIR Phase I project to develop a new tape of probe                   and associated computing instrument for quickly measuring                       thermal properties of solid materials.  The combination to be                   employed is based on the miniature thin-film heat flux sensor                   recently developed at Virginia Tech.  The new probe will                        enable the thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity of                      solid materials specimens to be measured simply and rapidly.                    At the end of the probe will be a heat-flux sensor and two                      thin-film thermocouple, applied to it by a masked sputtering                    process.  To measure the thermal properties of a material                       specimen, the probe and specimen, initially at different                        temperatures, will be placed abruptly in close thermal contact                  by mechanical registration device.  The resulting flow of heat                  and the rapidly changing surface temperatures of the specimen                   will be converted to transient electrical signals.  These will                  be measured an recorded as functions of time.  A method for                     computing thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity from                     the electrical signals will be developed.                                                                                                                       The device to be developed will have application in materials                   manufacturing quality control, in research laboratories, and                    possibly in medical applications.",
