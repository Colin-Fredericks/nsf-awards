 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to develop a new class of                         computer-based methods for the estimation of properties of                      organic compounds from their molecular structure.  It is                        planned to develop the ABC approach which is based on the                       contributions of Atoms and Bonds in the properties of                           Conjugate forms of a molecular structure.  Although conjugates                  are extensively used in organic chemistry to draw qualitative                   conclusions on the stability and chemical properties of a                       compound, they have been completely ignored in property                         estimation for chemical engineering purposes.  Although an                      initial focus will entail simple thermodynamic properties,                      such as the heat of formation, the quantum-mechanical basis of                  this approach should permit the estimation of other physical                    properties, fractional charges on individual atoms of the                       compound, and electron densities and strengths of individual                    bonds.  These properties of molecular fragments will in turn                    lead to quantitative prediction of intermolecular interactions                  and chemical properties of compounds.  Thus, ABC will                           ultimately allow accurate and general estimation of a wide                      variety of properties, and thus more efficient analysis and                     design of products and processes.",
