 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the principal investigator will continue his               modelling of elliptical galactic systems and the analytical                     solution of the model problems.  In particular, he will construct               self-consistent models of elliptical galaxies by means of                       Staeckel potentials.  The main reasons for using Staeckel                       potentials are that they allow the same major orbit families as                 those found from numerical simulations of realistic galactic                    models and they lead to mathematically tractable problems.                           The aspect of astronomy that most of us are familiar with                  involves the use of telescopes to make observations of stars and                galaxies.  Another aspect that is less well known involves the                  construction of mathematical models of celestial objects in order               to gain a greater understanding of the physics of stellar                       systems.  This research involves the construction and analysis of               a model for elliptical galaxies by means of a potential that                    describes an interacting system of many bodies.",
