 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since its origin in the late Pleistocene, \u001aEmiliania huxleyi\u001a has               become ubiquitous in the world's oceans.  It is the most abundant               living coccolithophore and the most important organism in the                   transfer of atmospheric carbon dioxide to the ocean sediments.                  Morphological forms include coccolith.bearing and naked coccoid                 cells, and scaled flagellates.  Only the coccolith.bearing                      morphotype is readily identifiable in natural samples, and all                  studies to date on the distribution and abundance of the species                have been studies of only this morphotype.  Comparison to other                 coccolithophores suggests the motile form is an alternate life                  cycle stage, but the life cycle of \u001aEmiliania hyxleyi\u001a remains                  poorly understood, and its role in bloom dynamics is unknown.                   Recently developed techniques permit identification and tracking                of naked and flagellated \u001aEmliliania huyxleyi\u001a cells in natural                 populations and simplify determination of ploidy in cultured                    cells.  The objectives of this research are (1) to compare the                  abundances and distributions of the flagellated form to that of                 the coccoid forms in natural populations before, during and after               blooms, (2) to establish ploidy and the life history, and thus                  (3) to determine the role of the flagellated form, and of sexual                recombination, in bloom dynamics.",
