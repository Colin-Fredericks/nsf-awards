 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project is designed to improve the quality                      and quantity of science taught in the middle school                             classrooms in southwest Louisiana.  The project has three                       components.  The first component consists of four workshops                     in earth, life, physical, and space sciences.  The goals of                     this component are to: (l) update and broaden the knowledge                     of earth, life, physical, and space science for thirty-two                      grade 6-8 teachers and four grade 6-8 principals and (2)                        provide each participant with the methodology and the                           motivation to improve the quality and quantity of science                       instructed in their classroom and in their school.  The                         second component of is designed to provide the participants                     with the methodology and the motivation to effectively share                    what they have learned with their peers through five teacher                    enhancements activities.  The third component will involve                      the development of a model by which a local school system can                   inservice their teachers by providing workshops for a limited                   number of teachers and disseminating the information gained                     through teachers who are trained to share with their peers.                     The project is based on a similar one, funded by NSF, for K-6                   teachers and principals, with pertinent modifications.                                                                                                          An amount equivalent to 57.7% of the NSF award is being                         contributed as cost-sharing.//",
