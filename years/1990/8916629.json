 "awd_abstract_narration": "Balanced cross-sections are a powerful tool for under-                     standing the development of a fold-and-thrust belt, and have                    commonly been applied to external thrusts where internal strain                 is small.  However, the drawing of viable and admissible cross-                 sections for internal thrust sheets requires additional informa-                tion on strain within the thrust sheet, how the strain was dis-                 tributed and when during the deformation the strain accumulated.                By using strain history studies to separate successive finite                   increments of deformation, appropriate strain increments can be                 removed at proper times in the restoration sequence.  However, a                practical method for obtaining the required strain data has not                 been perfected or tested.  This project will collect strain data                from widespread markers in the well-known Meade thrust sheet of                 the Idaho-Wyoming-Utah thrust belt.  The methods developed in                   this project are expected to help extend the technique of cross-                section balancing to hinterland terrains.",
