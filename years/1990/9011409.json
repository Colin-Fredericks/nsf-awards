 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this application is to solicit support for the                   establishment of a basic core facility for Protein/Peptide                      Synthesis, Purification, and Characterization in the School of                  Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Georgia Institute of                          Technology.  The facility is being established to provide routine               access to the major pieces of basic biochemical/biological                      instrumentation.  The PIs are requesting an amino acid analyzer,                an autoclave, an ultracentrifuge, a high speed centrifuge, a cold               room, a densitometer, a fermenter, a FPLC, a HPLC, a                            protein/peptide sequencer, a peptide synthesizer, and a                         scintillation counter to equip this core facility.                                                                                                              The core facility for protein/peptide synthesis, purification,                  and characterization will be used primarily by five different                   research groups whose present access to modern pieces of                        biological and biochemical equipment is either extremely limited                or nonexistant.  The facility will greatly enhance our capability               to investigate the effects of ultraviolet radiation on eye lens                 proteins, the molecular basis of function and regulation of T7                  RNA polymerase, the effect of mutations on the folding pathway of               ubiquitin, the design and synthesis of specific and effective                   protease inhibitors, and the crystal structures of pea lectin and               human serum transferrin.",
