 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1986, the National Research Council (NCR) established the               Computer Science and Technology Board in recognition of the                     importance of computer science as an academic discipline and an                 intellectual domain, and of the increasingly critical role played by            information technology in virtually all facets of life.  The Board's            charter is a broad one:  to ensure that the U.S. makes every effort to          develop and use the major new national resource represented in                  computer science and technology.  The computer's contributions to               innovation and economic growth, to national security, to the quality            of life, and to scientific progress are pervasive and affect the                programs of a number of federal agencies, as well as domestic                   industries.  Until now, however, no organization has been suitably              positioned to address or influence the overall condition of this                important field.                                                                     The Computer Science and Technology Board is intended to be a              central asset for identifying the implications of new technologies,             assessing current and proposed policies that affect computer science            and technology, and anticipating challenges to the strength of the              U.S. computer science posture.                                                       Over the next 24 months, the Computer Science and Technology               Board will assess how best to organize the conduct of research and              teaching in the computer field, in light of emerging and anticipated            conditions.  The study will be performed by a committee drawn from a            variety of subdisciplines, with representation and input from                   administrators who control key resource pools, and will build on past           studies as relevant.//",
