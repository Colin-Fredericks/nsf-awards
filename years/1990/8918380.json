 "awd_abstract_narration": "For studies of plant-herbivore interactions, hybrid zones                  represent natural experiments in which genetic-based defenses                   have become scrambled through backcrossing.  Studies of insect                  pests of cottonwoods (Populus) show that pests are concentrated                 in hybrid zones and, within the zone, on backcrossed trees.                     Pests from river systems without hybrid zones perform better on                 the parent tree species than do pests from areas with hybrid                    zones.  These data suggest that highly susceptible hosts (i.e.,                 naturally occurring complex hybrids) not only support most of the               pest population, their presence may result in pest species either               losing or never evolving the ability to deal with the greater                   resistance of the parental tree species.  An implication of this                work is that susceptible hybrids can be used to manage pest                     dynamics in forestry and agriculture.                                           Because of the basic and applied implications of this topic,                    this project will examine the generality of this phenomenon (the                Sink Hypothesis) in a second system, Eucalyptus, in which                       hybridization is common.  The researchers will collaborate with                 eucalypt systematists, geneticists, and ecologists to study pest                dynamics in several well known natural hybrid systems.  The                     following questions will be addressed:  1. Are hybrid eucalypts                 sinks for herbivores such that a small proportion of potential                  hosts support most of the pest population?  2. If complex hybrids               are more susceptible to one pest, are they also more susceptible                to very different insect guilds?  3. Does the presence or absence               of hybrid zones affect pest densities in the pure host zone?                    These questions will be addressed in a natural system, common                   gardens with trees of known genotypes, and by documenting insect                attacks on herbarium specimens of parents and hybrids collected                 independent of the study.  Answers to these questions have not                  been examined for any system besides cottonwoods and should be                  fundamentally important in understanding the ecological and                     evolutionary interactions of plants and pests.",
