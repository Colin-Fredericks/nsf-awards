 "awd_abstract_narration": "The predictions of game theory are often contradicted in                        experiments with simple bargaining games and several                            investigators.  These results have been interpreted as being due                to players' concerns for fairness or spite.  However, the widely                varying designs of the previous experiments and the lack of serious             attempts to replicate them make a precise interpretation                        impossible.  This is of particular importance since current                     experimental evidence suggests that the outcomes of simple games                may be very sensitive to the details of experimental procedure.                 Moreover, it may be impossible to construct a direct test of game               theoretic models, even if procedural effects are understood.  This              is because current models assume a known distribution of attitudes              toward fairness and spite among the players.  This project conducts             experiments that explore the effects of experimental procedures and             the influence of fairness and spite.  The project develops a                    theory-based, experimentally tested econometric model that provides             estimates of the distribution of fairness and spite in simple                   bargaining games.  Game theory is widely and increasingly used in               economics, so more definitive evidence on the validity of game                  theory in bargaining and new statistical tools for correcting game              theoretic models would be a major contribution.                                                                                                                 The project conducts experiments with dictator and ultimatum games.             In these experiments, players divide a given amount of money (the               pie) between themselves.  An ultimatum game consists of two stages              in which the first player makes a single take-it-or-leave-it offer              (stage 1) and the second player must either accept or reject (stage             2).  Counter-offers are not possible.  In a dictator game, the                  first player makes an offer to which the second player cannot                   respond.  The conventional model predicts that in each game the                 first mover offers the second player the smallest positive amount               possible and, in the ultimatum game, that the second player accepts             this offer.  It is regularly observed in experiments that                       substantial fractions of first movers make non-trivial offers, even             in the dictator game where offers cannot be rejected.  This                     behavior frequently is attributed to concerns of fairness.                      However, the results of previous experiments do not provide                     sufficient information to determine whether players are trying to               be fair, whether non-trivial offers are reflections of proposers'               beliefs about what their opponents are likely to accept, or whether             other motivations influence behavior.  Also no two previous studies             used the same experimental procedures.  The experiments conducted               by this project will determine whether the behavior is systematic               and predictable.",
