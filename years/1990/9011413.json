 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to study coherent structures                  in geophysical flow by determining equilibrium solutions of the                 quasigeostrophic vorticity equation.  The system of equations                   is solved numerically using the Newton-Kantorovich algorithm                    and the stability properties of the solutions analyzed using                    both time integration studies and a dynamical systems approach.                      The results of this work will be applied to the phenomenon                 of atmospheric blocking, that is, the situation in which the                    planetary scale waves of the atmosphere maintain a stable                       configuration which causes weather patterns to persist for                      weeks at a time.  Modeling of the blocking process will examine                 the generation, maintenance, and decay of the blocks.  This                     research has obvious implications for improving medium range                    weather forecasting.                                                                 The PI is well qualified for this project.  She is an                      applied mathematician with background in fluid mechanics and                    atmospheric and oceanographic sciences.  This award is being                    made as a Research Initiation Award and is jointly funded by                    the Large-scale Dynamic Meteorology and Applied Mathematics                     Programs.",
