 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today many applications deal with large quantities of data that                 take the form of a stream -- an ordered sequence of data items.                 Streams arise in many forms, including text files, genetic                      sequences, sound tracks, geological strata from drill holes,                    videotape, histories of sensor values, and so on. There is a                    serious need for a new approach in stream data processing.                      Today's database systems are not able to manage this data.  The                 approach we propose to investigate develops database systems from               the established paradigm of stream processing, in which                         transducers (functional transformations) operate on streams.                    Under this approach databases are treated as streams, and queries               or data analyzers are compositions of transducers that transform                input data streams to output streams as needed. The objective of                this research is to clarify the foundations of the resulting                    stream database paradigm.  Important problems include adapting                  database concepts to the stream processing environment,                         characterizing useful stream pattern match queries, formalizing                 the optimization of stream database transducers, and finding the                limits of the stream database approach.  Beyond general uses in                 stream data processing, this research will have applications in                 DBMS/KBMS integration, database systems supporting data                         exploration, and a variety of special purpose database systems -                including systems that manage genetic sequences, event                          histories, and on-line data.",
