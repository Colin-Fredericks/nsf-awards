 "awd_abstract_narration": "Existing structures in the U.S. which were designed prior to                    the adoption of modern seismic design codes present a                           potential problem for poor dynamic behavior during an                           earthquake.  Methods to upgrade structures and repair                           structures after earthquakes are important to earthquake                        hazard mitigation and earthquake engineering.                                                                                                                   This research project transfers the knowledge and technology                    developed by Mexico after the September, 1985, Mexico                           earthquake related to repair and retrofit of structures.  The                   approach is by using the case study method.  Documentation of                   the cases focuses on the design process and the technical                       approach used.  These results are then directly transferable                    to earthquake hazard mitigation in the United States.",
