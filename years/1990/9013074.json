 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a 3-day workshop entitled \"Opportunities                  and Challenges in Crystallization Research\" to be held at the                   Engineering Research Institute at Iowa State University in                      November 1990.  A great deal of progress has been made in the                   last three decades following the development of techniques for                  modeling crystal size distribution and relating the                             distribution to process design and crystallization kinetics.                    As a result of the analyses facilitated by these modeling                       techniques, much has been learned about the nature of crystal                   growth and nucleation in mixed suspensions such as those                        common in the process industries.  The effects of the                           phenomena of secondary nucleation and growth dispersion and                     the effects of trace quantities of additives or impurities                      have been delineated.  Progress has been made toward                            fundamental understanding of these phenomena.  This past work                   has opened the door for additional research that has the                        potential to vastly increase knowledge about crystallization                    from solution.  This workshop will assess this progress and                     determine the potential for future work to increase our                         understanding of this important phenomenon.                                                                                                                     The participants for this workshop are chosen from both                         industry and academia, and they will include the leading                        researchers involved in research and development of                             applications of crystallization from solution.  A final report                  will be provided to the National Science Foundation.  A                         summary of the findings will be submitted for publication.",
