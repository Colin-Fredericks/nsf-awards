 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increased salience of immigrant business has attracted a               growing body of research, but two major questions, which this                   proposal addresses, remain:  What is distinctively ethnic about                 the immigrant firm?  Do these distinctive ethnic characteristics                contribute to the firm's survival, profitability, and growth?                        This research is a longitudinal comparative study of self-                 employed persons in retail and service businesses in Chicago.                   The researchers will conduct 850 interviews with new small-                     business owners in the following groups:  Cubans, Mexicans,                     Puerto Ricans, Koreans, Chinese, Philipinos, Blacks and Whites,                 reinterviewing them two years later.  They are testing a model of               ethnic immigrant incorporation into the labor  market.  The                     methods include event history analysis over time to analyze                     survival or mortality of the businesses over time.                                   The study is novel in several ways.  First, the data is                    unique, consisting of the comprehensive list of applicants for a                General Business License in the city of Chicago.  Second, the                   theoretical model of ethnic entrepreneurial development is novel                in arguing that the interaction between ethnic group                            characteristics and the opportunity structure produces two                      distinct patterns of entrepreneurial development that are                       associated with the two modes of labor market incorporation of                  immigrant groups:  replacement labor and replacement                            entrepreneurs.  The two patterns of immigrant incorporation and                 business development are associated with the type of migration,                 social background, and organizing capacity of the group,                        differences that will affect business survival, profitability,                  and success.",
