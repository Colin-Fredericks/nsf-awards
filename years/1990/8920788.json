 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of intensive aquaculture techniques in the United                  States has placed an increasing emphasis on maintaining water                   quality.  Development of a low-cost and reliable automated                      water quality and feed condition monitoring  and control system                 would provide both research and commercial aquaculturists with                  a means of maintaining water quality for hatchery, nursery,                     grow-out and feed production systems.  Information gathered                     from both research and commercial aquaculturists and instrument                 manufacturers has indicated that four elements are required to                  design an appropriate monitoring/control system: an                             understanding of the biological, physical and chemical                          parameters critical to aquaculture; experience in                               instrumentation (and calibration); microcomputer programming                    capability; and experience with control devices and electronic                  theory.  To date there have been no coordinated efforts to                      integrate these four elements to produce a complete system of                   monitoring and control for aquaculture.  Utilization of off-                    the-shelf environmental sensors, microcomputers and control                     devices integrated by software modules would go far in                          alleviating the problems attendant to maintaining water quality                 in intensive  aquaculture systems.",
