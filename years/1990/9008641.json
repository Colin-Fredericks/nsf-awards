The                   program seeks to enable U.S. scientists and engineers to                        conduct long-term research abroad at research institutions of                   proven excellence.  Awards provide opportunities for the                        conduct of joint research, and the use of unique or comple-                     mentary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions in                    foreign countries.                                                                                                                                              This award will support a twelve-month visit by Dr. Erik                        Brown to France to work with Drs Franoise Yiou and Grant M.                     Raisbeck at the Centre de Spectrometrie Nuclear et de                           Spectrometrie de Masse (C.S.N.S.M.) of the Orsay campus of                      the University of Paris on \"Geochronological Applications of                    Cosmogenic Isotopes.\"  Our understanding of Earth's climatic                    history is dependent on terrestrial remnants of past                            glaciation, and on chemical and biological records preserved                    in deep-sea sediments and in polar ice.  Information regarding                  past changes in temperatures, oceanic circulation patterns,                     sea level and extent of glaciation has been derived from these                  sources, but absolute dating methods with which to tie data                     from one area of the globe to those from another have yet to                    be fully developed.  Many dating techniques involve the use                     of cosmogenic radioisotopes (e.g. carbon-14, beryllium-10,                      aluminum-26) which are products of the spallation of nuclei                     of terrestrial material by cosmic rays.  The proposed                           research will focus on developing two separate geochronological                 methods using beryllium-10 and aluminum-26.  One of these is                    the determination of exposure ages of rock surfaces through                     the use of cosmogenic isotopes produced in situ within                          mineral lattices. This will allow the dating of deposits such                   as terminal moraines, providing an important tool for                           interpreting glacial history.  A second provides an absolute                    link between sedimentary and ice core records through the use                   of a pair of spikes in beryllium-10 concentrations observed                     in ice cores in snow laid down 35,000 years and 60,000 years                    ago.  If the same anomalies can be found in deep-sea sediments,                 they can be used to link the sedimentary and ice core                           records, thus correlating oceanic and atmospheric histories.",
