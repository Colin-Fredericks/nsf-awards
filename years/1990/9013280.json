 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent results show a sun/climate relationship subject to                  modulation by equatorial stratospheric winds, viz. the                          quasibiennial oscillation (QBO).  These results show responses                  of the atmospheric meteorological parameters to solar activity                  from the mesosphere down to the troposphere seem to be dependent                on the QBO phase.  This relationship will be examined in the                    context of atmospheric variables with emphasis on the link                      between the QBO and the extratropical atmosphere.  This involves                a two-fold effort: the investigation of the statistical                         significant of the solar/QBO/weather (climate) relationship, and                the study of dynamical links between tropical and extratropical                 variability.  The statistical testing will involve the use of                   data from the surface to 10 mb, in all seasons.  Particular                     attention will be paid to details such as definition  of the QBO                phase, selection of averaging periods, and possibilities of QBO                 modulation in either or both QBO phases.  The investigation of                  dynamical links will involve examining atmospheric data from the                surface to 1mb for evidence of QBO modulation of the                            extratropical atmosphere.  Since a mechanism for the                            QBO/extratropics connection may involve modulation of planetary                 wave propagation, emphasis will be given to the propagation of                  planetary waves and their interaction with the mean flow.",
