 "awd_abstract_narration": "SIPP ACCESS has created, designed and maintained a national                     facility for shared use of a database on the 1984 Survey of                     Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The record of work by                  researchers across the United States using the SIPP Access                      facility shows that great economies in research can be achieved                 by using its capabilities.                                                                                                                                      Continuing that facility and effectively transferring                           capabilities of the facility to a permanent site in the Census                  Bureau are the objectives of the current grant. An evaluation                   that will communicate insights from the SIPP ACCESS prototype to                others with complex data management tasks will also be part of                  the project.  It will discuss: 1) the sources of efficiency in                  the SIPP ACCESS system, 2) management of a complex database, 3)                 data enhancements and their value-added, 4) relational databases                management systems, query languages and strategic thinking about                preservation of data in a dynamic environment, 5) training,                     information overload and the learning curve, and 6) the                         implications of the SIPP ACCESS System for data and information                 systems in the 1990s.                                                                                                                                           A revised version of PC-SIPPTEST, a highly innovative personal                  computer version of the project which has been tested at six                    beta-test sites in the past year, is to be produced.",
