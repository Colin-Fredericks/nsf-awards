 "awd_abstract_narration": "How birds navigate during long-distance migrations remains                      mysterious, but there is behavioral evidence to suggest that                    some birds detect the earth's magnetic field.  There is                         controversy about whether such magnetic detection requires a                    magnetic material such as the mineral magnetite.  This                          mechanism would be an exciting new discovery if true, but                       because of conflicting results, a rigorous set of tests still                   is needed to establish its validity.  One property of magnetite                 is that it can be re-magnetized, and this project use the novel                 approach of applying a remagnetizing pulse to migratory birds,                  and then measuring their nightly behavior of preferred headings                 in a planetarium.  The presence or lack of short-term or long-                  term effects from different conditions of remagnetization will                  be examined.  This approach creates a set of critical tests to                  reject or accept whether behavioral magnetic field detection                    depends on magnetic particles.  Results from this novel                         approach will have an impact on this controversial and                          interesting field, and this project also has a significant                      impact on undergraduate scientific experience.",
