 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two week workshop for thirty experienced introductory physics                 faculty is being held at the United States Air Force Academy.  The              faculty who attend the workshop during the summer of 1990 will then             themselves conduct workshops during the 1990 academic year for physics          faculty in their local area.  The project is enabling physics                   professors to become skilled in the use of interactive technologies for         transforming introductory physics courses for undergraduates.  The              discussion and formulation of new paradigms for general physics content         is based on the capabilities of the new interactive, information                technologies, such as computer-interfaced experiments, desk-top                 digitized video, symbolic algebra computer software, HyperCard lessons,         CD-ROM, and the computer-enhanced classroom.  The workshop is also              including preparation for the participants to lead local workshops on           the new science content using interactive technology after they return          to their home campus.",
