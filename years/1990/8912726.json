The cooperating principal investigators are Dr. J.N. Reddy of VPI               and Professor A.V. Krishna Murty of the Indian Institute of                     Science, Bangalore.  Dr. Murty is the initiating scientist in                   India.  Upon his receipt of approval from his government to                     organize a conference in this scientific field, Dr. Murty invited               Dr. Reddy to coordinate and lead the U.S. delegation.  The list of              invited U.S. participants was proposed by Dr. Murty and was                     included in his proposal submitted to the cognizant Indian                      government agency, the Department of Science and Technology.  The               workshop will provide opportunity for about thirty papers to be                 delivered and discussed.  The papers will be published in book form             as a state-of-the-art work on the various topics on composite                   materials and structures and their application to aerospace                     structures.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  The purpose of the workshop is to foster a detailed                     exchange of recent advances related to the development of novel                 composite systems, thermo-mechanical models, computational schemes              and design methodologies for advanced composite materials for space             applications.  The workshop will bring together scientific research             scientists from the universities and private institutions of the                two countries to work together in the areas of composite material               systems and structures.  The direct and rapid exchange of                       information, by individuals from both the public and private                    sectors of the two countries, in the areas material science,                    mechanics, analytical modeling, advanced techniques and software                for use in practical designs, and fabrication and manufacturing                 will provide a cross-disciplinary exposure of information that                  meets a major objective of the U.S. - India Cooperative Science                 Program.  The workshop is also intended to assist in the concept                formulation of future collaborative research proposals.",
