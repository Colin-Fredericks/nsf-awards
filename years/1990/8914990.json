 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support collaborative research in solid state                   chemistry between Dr. William Glaunsinger, Arizona State University             and Dr. Pierre Colombet, Institute for Material Physics and                     Chemistry, Nantes, France.  The objective of the project is the                 synthesis and characterization of sulfide intercalation compounds.                                                                                              The primary thrust of modern materials research is to synthesis new             materials and structural arrangements with desirable chemical and               physical properties based on a knowledge of key structure-property              relationships.  One of the best examples of this theme has been                 research on intercalation compounds, which are formed by the                    insertion of guest species (intercalants) into a host matrix.  By               appropriate choice of guest and hosts, intercalation compounds can              be prepared with controlled chemical, structural, thermal,                      motional and electronic properties.  In the proposed project, the               investigators plan to elucidate the structures and chemical                     reactivity of a carefully selected set of prototypical intercalation            compounds using four different classes of chalcogenide hosts.                   These materials will provide a unique solid-state framework for                 detailed study of a diversity of intriguing structuring, physical               and chemical phenomena in reduced dimensionality.  Crystal                      structures will be determined using neutron and X-ray diffraction.              This project will benefit from the complementary expertise of the               two investigators.  Dr. Colombet and his group are internationally              recognized researchers in layered compound chemistry and Dr.                    Glaunsinger has significant experience in the area of intercalation             compounds.",
