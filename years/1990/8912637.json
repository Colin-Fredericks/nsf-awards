 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of approximately ten U.S.                 engineers in an international workshop on technological innovation              in construction, to be held in Zurich, Switzerland in April, 1990.              The meeting is coorganized by Professor D. W. Halpin of the Construc-           tion Engineering Department of Purdue University and Professor Robert           Fechtig, head of the Construction Division of the ETH in Zurich.                Professor Halpin edited a report for the Office of Technology                   Assessment on the competition between countries in the International            Architecture, Engineering and Construction market.  This report                 demonstrated that there are philosophical differences in how                    construction is viewed both from a market structure perspective and             from a market penetration point of view, and that this may explain              why the U.S. is lagging behind in competitive performance.  U.S. firms          consider construction to be a service oriented industry in which the            designer and construction contractor play the role of \"technology               broker.\"  European and Japanese contractors see construction as both            a product and service oriented activity in which the firm not only              delivers the technology but is the developer of the technology.                                                                                                 The key issues confronting the international construction industry              today are the utilization of new technologies in the design and                 production of constructed facilities, and the change of organizational          and contractual structures to be more responsive to international               markets.  The proposed workshop will address these issues by providing          a forum for international experience transfer in advancing construction         technology and increasing the understanding of mechanisms for                   technological innovation in construction.  The conclusions and                  recommendations of the meeting will be widely disseminated throughout           the U.S. through the International Construction Task Force of the               Construction Industry Institute.",
