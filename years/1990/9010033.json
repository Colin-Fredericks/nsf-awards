 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop methodologies for             sequencing and scheduling in uncertain manufacturing environments.              The methodology involves an off-line optimization strategy, an on-              line control scheme, and a \"rescheduling\" procedure.  The off-line              strategy utilizes a graph-theoretic formulation of the scheduling               problem to generate a priori static schedules which take into                   account the presence of foreseeable system disruptions.  A measure              of schedule robustness will be developed for the off-line schedule.             The on-line control structure is modeled as a discrete event                    dynamic system (DEDS).  The research control structure incorporates             the dynamic information about future disturbances to stabilize the              operations schedule.  The novelty of the approach is that it                    decomposes the overall control problem into non-myopic local                    problems which require minimum computation while retaining a global             view of the system.  The rescheduling procedure updates the static              schedule after a major system disruption.  The procedure generates              an updated schedule which minimizes the scheduling delay and at the             same time adheres closely to the off-line schedule.  In contrast                to the previous work on match-up scheduling, the research method                has no need to determine the match-up time.  The robustness and the             applicability of the research methodology will be tested by                     experiments.",
