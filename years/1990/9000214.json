 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Huanghe (Yellow River) is one of the world's largest in                     terms of sediment discharge to the ocean (approximately 1.1                     billion tons per year) and largest in terms of suspended                        matter concentration 25 grams per liter.  This award will                       allow retrieval of both river and estuarine data for the                        Huanghe.  The former data set includes measurements of                          average daily discharge (of water and sediment) at a number                     of selected stations along the river, from above the loess                      hills that form the primary sediment source downstream to                       Kenli (20 kilometers from the river mouth).  The estuarine                      data include hydrographic, current meter and suspend matter                     observations and samples collected synoptically during three                    cruises 1984 and 1987 for periods of 2 to 3 days.  The river                    and estuary data both include several stations across the                       channel cross section, thus allowing proper width-and-                          averages to be calculated and compared with numerical                           models.  These unique data sets will allow characterization                     of transport patterns of the Huanghe along its path with                        respect to time and distance as well as discharge patterns                      into the adjacent Gulf of Bohai.  The present study focuses                     primarily on the estuary itself: how the sediment discharged                    at its head propagates through the estuary and is discharged                    to the delta front.",
