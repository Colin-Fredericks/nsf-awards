 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the series of reactions comprising a metabolic sequence in cells             or living organism, one central question has long concerned                     biochemists.  Is a metabolite which is the product of one enzymic               reaction and the substrate for a succeeding enzymic reaction formed             and acted upon in a complex of the two proteins or is it produced               in the first system and then dissociated into the surrounding                   medium to be captured and utilized by the second?  This problem                 will be attacked in two ways: (a) by the use of dynamic light                   scattering to study the diffusional properties of the components                of the system singly and together and by attempting to stabilize                the presumptive complex of the two proteins through photochemical               cross-linking.  The two systems studied will be the glycerol                    phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase two enzymes which             have as a common metabolite, nicotinic-adenine-dinucleotide.",
