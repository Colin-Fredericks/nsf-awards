 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to the Department of Anthropology at                City College of the City University of New York to establish an REU             Site Project to involve undergraduates in the study of contem                   porary socio-cultural change among the highland Maya and Mexican                national (Ladino or Mestizo) communities of Chiapas, southeastern               Mexico.  Students will live with families in Indian villages three              days a week, coming in to the research center in the city of San                Cristobal de las Casas for seminars, Maya language lessons, and                 discussion with the PI.  Group trips to handicraft production                   cooperatives, experimental agricultural stations, and government                offices will take place periodically in accord with the research                needs of the project.  Students will learn basic censusing                      techniques, extensive interviewing and oral narrative accounts,                 participant observation, and apprenticeship training to learn the               socialization process in handicraft production.  They will write                daily diaries and submit a summary report at the end of the                     project.  The observations of students located in families in five              different communities will add up to an account of coping                       strategies in the debt crisis Mexico is undergoing.  She will draw              on the expertise of George Collier, Jan Rus, and Nancy Modiano who              will help in the allocation of students and enter into weekly                   seminar discussions.",
