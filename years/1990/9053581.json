 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three year project is aimed at elementary teachers                         with little or no experience in teaching science and                            utilizes the expertise and resources of NASA, the Jet                           Propulsion Laboratory and the California State                                  Polytechnic University at Pomona, California.  This                             project, based on a successful previously funded                                project, will increase the teachers' comfort level with                         science, mathematics and technology.  This newly                                acquired confidence will result in increased motivation                         and time spent in the teaching of science.  Each summer                         fifty teachers (two/school) and their administrators                            (25) will be selected from schools in California,                               Indian reservations in the Southwest and from Eastern                           and Southern sites served by several Historically Black                         Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  The participants                             will spend four weeks in intensive instruction during                           each of the summers, followed by academic year                                  meetings.  The topics of electricity, sound, light and                          astronomy will be covered at a pace which allows time                           for thinking and experimenting.  A variety of effective                         teaching strategies with emphasis on understanding                              mathematical applications will be used.  The second and                         third years continue with new groups of teachers and                            administrators with the continued support of past                               participants.                                                                                                                                                   Administrators are required to implement a science plan                         including staff development at the school site.                                 \"Clone\" programs will be set up at HBCU sites to insure                         the proliferation of this model.                                                                                                                                In addition to the NSF request, NASA, JPL, the                                  University and the participating schools are                                    contributing an equal amount of the funding.",
