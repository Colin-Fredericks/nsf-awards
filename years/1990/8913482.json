 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research involves the numerical solution of                   various free boundary value problems modelling flows of liquids                 in Hele-Shaw cells.  Such Hele-Shaw flows, as they are called,                  are important in their own right, and they serve as very useful                 models of more complicated phenomena involving free boundaries.                 The proposed research will produce robust numerical schemes                     capable of handling many different types of nonlinear phenomena                 whose analytic resolution is currently impossible.                                   The phenomenon of \"fingering\" of one fluid as it flows into                another is a common, easily observed occurrence that is very                    difficult to describe quantitatively.  The proposed research will               suggest and evaluate different kinds of methods for studying                    numerically the set of mathematical equations that govern the                   evolution in time of an unstable finger.  A successful numerical                scheme for this particular problem will have much broader                       applicability to a host of problems in fluid dynamics.",
