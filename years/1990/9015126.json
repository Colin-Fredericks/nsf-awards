The first                                         conference was held April 26-May 2, 1981.                                       During the intervening 10 years, impressive                                     advances have taken place in geotechnical                                       earthquake engineering, and major earthquakes                                   have occurred around the world (such as the                                     1985 earthquakes in Chile and Mexico); and                                      the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989                                              highlighted the destruction that can occur in                                   a major metropolis as a result of a moderate                                    earthquake.                                                                                                                                                     This conference is co-sponsored by eleven                                       major and international organizations with a                                    strong interest in geotechnical earthquake                                      engineering.  The themes for the conference                                     cover all aspects of the subject, from                                          structures on land to offshore structures                                       (especially those used in oil exploration);                                     the safety of dams, retaining walls,                                            hazardous waste and sanitary landfills; the                                     performance of building foundations; the use                                    of geotextiles for earthquake hazard                                            mitigation; the performance of lifelines;                                       landslides and the stability of slopes.                                         Thirteen internationally recognized speakers                                    will present state-of-the-art presentations                                     and many members of the Steering Committee                                      and the Organizing Committee are                                                internationally recognized earthquake                                           engineers.  A special session addresses                                         lessons learned from the 1989 Loma Prieta                                       earthquake.                                                                                                                                                     The proceedings from this conference will                                       present the state of the art in geotechnical                                    earthquake engineering and will contribute to                                   research and implementation of earthquake                                       hazard mitigation.  This conference will be                                     an important early contribution to the                                          International Decade of Natural Disaster                                        Reduction (1990 - 2000).",
