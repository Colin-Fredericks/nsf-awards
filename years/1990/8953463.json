 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation and extension of a partnership                   which has developed between Henderson State University of                       Arkansas, the Mid-American Museum and Arkansas Power and Light                  Company.  The partnership has developed, through private                        funding, a number of different topically oriented science kits                  which fit appropriately with the curriculum framework of the                    state.                                                                                                                                                          The project will be conducted during the summer of 1990 using                   laboratory and classroom facilities of Henderson State                          University and the interactive exhibits of the museum to                        provide a two-week workshop for two master teachers from each                   of the sixteen educational cooperatives which cover the whole                   state of Arkansas.  The lead teachers will be using these kits                  which will be further enhanced and adapted from the existing                    activity based materials.  The participants under the                           supervision and guidance of the project staff will conduct in-                  service workshops in their local areas with the cooperation of                  their local education cooperative.  These state-administered                    cooperatives will facilitate the inservice efforts in the                       schools within their regions.  Needs assessment and field                       experience has demonstrated the need for this inservice                         training.  The immediate goal is to established a cadre of                      well-prepared elementary science teachers, but the long range                   goal is to upgrade the skills of large number of elementary                     teachers and to provide a model for other university-museum-                    industry partnerships.  Because of the comprehensive nature of                  the project, the potential for change in the direction of an                    activity-based elementary science program, as a result of this                  grant, is far-reaching.                                                                                                                                         The Museum is contributing it facilities, expertise and the                     actual kit development, while the Power Company is contributing                 the cost of all the materials for the  workshop which will then                 be returned to the schools.  The total cost-sharing by three                    partners is equivalent to 28% of the NSF                                        grant request.",
