 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this workshop is to provide an assessment of                current research in the People's Republic of China in the areas                 of computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), production                engineering, precision engineering, and production systems and                  process planning.  It will also afford the opportunity for                      interaction between Chinese and United States researchers on                    these subjects.  Through this interaction, the workshop will                    calibrate the research of our Chinese counterparts against that                 of the United States research community.  To accomplish this a                  select group of Chinese researchers in the above-mentioned fields               will be invited to the United States to attend the National                     Science Foundation-sponsored Conference on Production Research                  and Technology-Advances in Manufacturing Systems Integration and                Processes, to be held January 8-12, 1990 at Arizona State                       University in Tempe, AZ.  After the meeting, visits would be                    arranged for the Chinese researchers to National Science                        Foundation-funded Engineering Research Centers in these fields as               well as to other University and industry research laboratories                  conducting similar work.  At the end of the workshop activity,                  the attendees of the workshop will be asked to submit a report                  detailing their observations and findings, summarizing their own                work, and comparing it to similar work they saw in the                          United States.",
