 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Children's Museum proposes a three-year project to develop a set of         curriculum materials in physical science to increase the effectiveness          of science education in middle schools, grades 6 to 8.  This project            will be undertaken in collaboration with the Massachusetts Pre-                 Engineering Program (MassPEP) and Boston Public Schools.                                                                                                        The Children's Museum, with classroom teachers, will develop curriculum         topics using an integrated approach in which curriculum, teacher                training, and use of outside resources will complement and reinforce            each other.  Cuisenaire Company will publish and distribute a core group        of 6 to 8 topic investigations.  These investigations can be used as            extensions to encourage students to comprehend and appreciate topics of         their regular science curriculum or they can be used for a more in depth        explanation of a phenomenon.  Each of the topics is an alternative way          of teaching basic concepts that are part of existing science curricula          for middle school.                                                                                                                                              There will be several products of the proposed program, and an overall          model.  The products will include teacher guides and kits for each              curriculum topic distributed by Cuisenaire; documents that describe the         process of community-based organization and the local school system can         utilize the curriculum topics to effect changes in attitudes of middle          school minority and female students toward science as a course of study         and career possibility.  This model of collaboration between a science          center, community - based organization, and a school system will be             replicable in cities throughout the country.",
