 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolutionary studies often conclude that lineages of                       organisms have acquired \"adaptations\" -- novel morphological,                   behavioral, ecological, or reproductive features that confer some               advantage to individual organisms.  Very rarely do these studies                confirm the actual advantage by direct measurement.  One example                is the evolution of the symmetrical (\"homocercal\") fish tail from               asymmetric (\"heterocercal\") precursors.  The conclusion has been                that the homocercal tail conferred higher speed, greater                        maneuverability, and faster acceleration.  Dr. George Lauder                    proposes to use newly developed micro-accelerometers, mounted on                the tails of fish swimming in flow tanks, to gather performance                 data to test this conclusion.  The accelerometer data gathering                 will be coordinated with Dr. Lauder's high-speed video imaging                  and electromyography (muscle activity) monitoring systems.  The                 first performance data will emerge for homocercal and                           heterocercal fishes.                                                                 The proposed research is inherently risky, being the first                 application of new sensors to a biological problem.  Extensive                  software development will be necessary to couple the three data                 streams.  If this Small Grant for Exploratory Research Project is               successful, biologists will have acquired a powerful new                        technique for assessing functional capabilities, and a                          significant question in fish evolution will have been addressed.",
