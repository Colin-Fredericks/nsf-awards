 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic                  Chemistry Program deals with the synthesis and exploitation of                  weakly coordinating anions. These are negatively charged ions                   which are designed to have little tendency to form bonds either                 to metal atoms or to positively charged ions in general. The                    need for new anions which approach the ideal of a                               non-coordinating anion is general throughout chemistry, and                     wide application in synthetic chemistry and in mechanistic                      studies is envisioned.                                                                                                                                          The main focus of the project will be the pseudo-icosahedral                    carborane anion B11CH12- and its derivatives, which will be                     investigated as counterions for reactive cations. Substitution                  at both the C-H and B-H bonds will be used to increase the size                 of the anion, lower its nucleophilicity, and lower its tendency                 towards oxidation. The new weakly-coordinating anions are                       expected to enable the structural characterization of long                      sought after ions such as the silicenium ion, the formation of                  complexes of very weak donors (e.g. xenon, hydrocarbons,                        fluorocarbons), the improvement of cationic homogeneous                         catalysts and an expansion of scope and diversity of Lewis acid                 and electrophile-promoted chemistry.",
