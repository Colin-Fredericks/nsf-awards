 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of faculty adviser Dr. William Culberson,               graduate student Paula DePriest will study genetic variation and                species boundaries in lichens using new molecular-biological                    methods.  Lichens, fungal and algal partners forming long-lived                 and durable associations, are the best-known examples of                        symbiosis.  As one feature of this symbiosis, the fungal partner                makes unique chemical substances, lichen secondary products,                    which may protect the lichen against herbivory.  These secondary                compounds have been used for over a hundred years as characters                 to identify lichen species, and when correlated with geographic                 distribution or ecology, they have also been used to define a                   lichen species.                                                                      In this study the student will examine the relationship                    between four chemotypes that cannot be recognized from their                    morphology alone--they have different secondary products but all                look alike.  These chemotypes occur in mixed populations in the                 southern Appalachians.  Do they represent separate,                             reproductively isolated species or are they variable parts of one               species?  The immediately obvious experimental approaches will                  not work; for example, crossing individuals of different                        chemotypes in the field is technically impossible and lichen                    cultures in the laboratory do not reproduce sexually.  In this                  study, newly developed DNA technologies for analyzing variants of               ribosomal gene sequences will be employed to measure genetic                    relatedness among the chemotypes and their sporelings in the                    laboratory.  Genetic similarity between different chemotypes,                   based on the sharing of molecular-genetic markers, will indicate                that they are members of a single species.  Differences in                      molecular-genetic markers will indicate reproductive isolation                  and separate species status.  These new techniques will allow                   routine genetic evaluation of lichen relatedness and provide new                tools for the taxonomic investigation of lichens.",
