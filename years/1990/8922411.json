 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor Bernd Berg of Florida State                       University and several of his graduate students for                             \u001acollaborative research visits to the Physics Department of                     the University of Bielefeld, Federal Republic of Germany,                       where they will work with Professor Bengt Petersson and                         others.  They are working on a variety of topics in lattice                     gauge theory and computation, including large scale computer                    simulations of quantum field theories, in particular Quantum                    Chromodynamics (QCD).  The German group has been working                        mainly with a Cray computer, and has free access to several                     supercomputer facilities at Bielefeld and Juelich.  Such                        experience will upgrade the capabilities of the U.S. group,                     which has been working on Cyber and ETA supercomputers.                                                                                                         QCD is the generally accepted candidate for the theory of                       strong particle interactions.  It is typically relevant at                      scales which are smaller than 1 Fermi = 10 to the minus 12th                    centimeter.  Experimentally such small distances are                            investigated with large colliders; observations of relics                       from the very early universe also provide information.  There                   are severe technical difficulties in trying to calculate                        actual numbers from QCD.  Presently, the leading approach to                    overcome these difficulties is by means of large scale                          computer simulations.  Part of this collaborative proposal                      is to exploit finite size scaling concepts to shed light on                     many open QCD problems.  Another aspect involves pioneering                     the use of supercomputers as a new tool for investigating                       quantum gravity related problems.",
