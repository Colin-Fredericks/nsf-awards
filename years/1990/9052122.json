 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beaver College is integrating molecular biology and biotechnology               across the curriculum so that every student will have adequate                  background to understand developments in modern biology, medicine, and          biotechnology. Electrophoresis and high speed centrifugation equipment          enable students to gain experience in molecular biology in the                  introductory biology and in the  interdisciplinary science courses              taken by every student. The equipment is also being incorporated into           teaching methods courses taken by elementary and secondary school               teachers. Students use electrophoresis to explore the relationship              between genes and gene products, and to understand how it can be used           to demonstrate relationships among organisms. Students in upper level           biology courses also use the equipment, along with more sophisticated           electrophoretic and blotting techniques, protein purification and               characterization, gene cloning, amplification, and screening, to extend         their knowledge of molecular biology and biotechnology. The college             will contribute an amount equal to the award.",
