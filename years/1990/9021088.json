The thrust of Dr. Schey's research is the development                 and construction of a versatile time-of-flight mass                             spectrometer and its application to the analysis of very large                  molecules of biological interest.                                                                                                                               A versatile, tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometer will be                    constructed which is ideally suited to produce structural                       information on very large molecules. Ionization by matrix-                      assisted infrared laser desorption and broadband emission from                  a point source flashlamp will be investigated to improve                        ionization efficiency for biomolecules.  Photodissociation by                   both CO2 laser and flashlamp emission will be explored as a                     means to characterize the structure of large biomolecules.  The                 ability of surface induced dissociation to generate                             structurally important fragmentation will be evaluated.",
