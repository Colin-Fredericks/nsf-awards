 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two-year cooperative research project in              physics between Dr. Richard F. Haglund, Jr., Department of Physics              and Astronomy, Vanderbilt University, and Dr. Noriaki Itoh,                     Department of Physics, Nagoya University, Japan.  They will study               laser-induced desorption (laser sputtering) in semiconductors and               insulators, and especially the effect of high electronic excitation             density on such desorption.  The high density results from the                  intensity of the laser light and the strong absorption of it that               takes place in the irradiated material, leading to a comparatively              large concentration of excited valence-band electrons.  The                     scientists hope to  obtain a clearer picture of the ways in which the           electronic energy delivered by laser photons to dielectric and                  semiconductor surfaces is absorbed, transformed, and ultimately                 dissipated through defect generation, bond-breaking, and desorption.            The program is designed to take advantage of unique facilities,                 experience, and interests in the two laboratories: the initial                  studies will be carried out with visible and ultraviolet lasers on              well-characterized compound-semiconductor surfaces in Japan;  at                Vanderbilt, alkali halides and alkaline-earth fluorides will be                 studied using both time-resolved optical desorption and photoelectron           spectroscopies.  Use of a free-electron laser due to become                     operational at Vanderbilt in 1990 is also planned in these                      experiments.                                                                                                                                                    The interaction of laser light with various materials has been a                subject of great interest almost from the invention of the laser, for           both technological and scientific reasons.  The development of                  substrates and coatings for lasers inevitably involved such studies,            for example.  At the present time the operative physical mechanisms             in many technological applications of laser-surface interactions,               such as laser-assisted thin-film deposition and laser                           microlithography, are not well characterized.  It is the aim of this            collaborative research project to contribute to a fundamental                   understanding of these interactions.",
