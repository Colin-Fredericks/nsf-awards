 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the provision of conference expenses                 (including travel, subsistence, and other necessary expenses) for               selected computer professionals who are physically disabled, a                  member of a racial or ethic minority, or both.  The expenses are                for attendees at the conference on Computers and Quality of Life                (CQL'90) on September 13-16, 1990 in Washington, D.C..  The                     conferences is sponsored by the acm/SIGCAS (Association for                     Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Computers and                   Society) and the acm/SIGCAPH (Special Interest  Group on                        Computers and the Physically Handicapped).  This conference                     offers a multi-disciplinary dialog on what is known about the                   effects, both positive and negative, of computing on human well-                being.  The program features computing applications that benefit                the entire society or groups with special needs, e.g.,                          disabilities.  Project support will make possible for computer                  professionals, including instructors, to contribute to a dialog                 in which they would be able to participate without special                      support.***  //",
