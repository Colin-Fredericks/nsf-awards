 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a two-year study to infer the environmental history of the              antarctic peninsula region from an examination of sediment cores from           the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas.  Earlier analyses of benthic              foraminifera distribution, sediment distribution, and water column              profiles strongly suggested that the observed patterns are greatly              influenced by oceanographic, climatic, and glacial conditions.  Data            on the present-day distribution of these patterns will provide new              information on the microhabitat and geochemical associations between            surface sediments and benthic foraminifera.  The faunal-environmental           associations observed in the modern setting will be used to formulate           an interactive model using foraminiferal biofacies as indicators of             oceanographic response to changing climatic conditions.  This                   model will be used to infer paleoceanographic and paleoclimatic                 conditions in downcore sediments by observing both large-scale                  foraminiferal assemblage changes, and small-scale (possibly seasonal)           laminations.  Benthic invertebrates reflect the links between the               atmosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere, and have been used                     extensively to investigate paleoenvironmental problems.  The                    sensitivity of benthic foraminifera to both chemical and physical               conditions of bottom waters has been extensively demonstrated in the            literature, and the group's well documented geological longevity has            made it a valuable tool for the paleoclimatic analysis of core                  material.",
