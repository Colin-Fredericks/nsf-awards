 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done on this project continues mathematical                     research on nonlinear elliptic problems arising in perfect-fluid                hydrodynamics.  Emphasis will be placed on the analytical study                 of the propagation of waves in stratified media.  Techniques from               nonlinear analysis and partial differential equations form the                  basis for these studies.  The primary goals are to understand                   better the nature of internal waves and the presence of vortex                  rings.                                                                               The internal waves arise from density stratification due to                changes in salinity or temperature, for example.  Experimental                  work shows striking examples of internal wave phenomena, and                    oceanic observations reveal internal waves up to 100 meters in                  amplitude.  This work will concentrate on the analysis of waves                 in the two-fluid system where two fluids of constant density meet               along a smooth density profile.  In this case, center-manifold                  theory can be applied to study the ordinary differential                        equations which replace the nonlinear partial differential                      equations for the wave motion.                                                       Recent applications of global analysis to study vortex rings               which have a Heaviside function distribution have proved                        effective.  Work will continue in an effort to understand the                   properties of the level set of the solutions to the equation                    describing the vortex displacement function.  The equation has                  jump discontinuities, for which existence can sometimes be                      established, but the nature of the level sets remains a mystery.",
