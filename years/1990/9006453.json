 "awd_abstract_narration": "An expansion of an extensive effort at the University of                   California Berkeley to attract, encourage and increase minority                 participation in the mathematical sciences will be supported by                 this award.  The genesis of the project lies in the Professional                Development Program at the university.  This program was begun in               1974 to enrich the mathematics-based professions with minorities                and women who could perform at levels of leadership.  Focus up to               1989 was on transforming the accomplishments of minority students               in freshman calculus from failure to success.  The success of the               effort has enabled significant numbers to graduate with majors in               engineering, science and mathematics.  This success has led to                  similar programs at other institutions such as the Universities                 of Illinois and Texas.                                                          This award is directed toward raising the sights of the PDP to                  that of directing promising minority undergraduates into science                careers.  At this point, few pursue upper-division mathematics                  courses far enough to experience the deductive emphasis which                   gives these courses such a different character from the                         computationally-oriented lower-division mathematics courses.                    The program funded by the award has three parts.  First, is a six               week residential research summer school designed to inspire and                 help prepare minority undergraduates who have excelled in lower                 division work.  The activity is designed to motivate them to                    continue their studies and eventually complete a Ph.D. degree in                either mathematics or a closely-related field.  A long-range                    research program will be conducted by the PDP staff aimed at                    better understanding the factors that lead students to enroll in                pivotal mathematics courses, understanding why they continue to                 study mathematics and why they enter mathematics-related fields.                Finally, work will be done to increase the number of faculty                    actively working on improving minority student performance and                  persistence in mathematics at all levels.  A special focus will                 be developing a cadre of research mathematicians who can serve as               effective mentors and graduate dissertation advisors to alumni of               the summer school experiences.                                                  Students will be selected nationally through advertisements in                  major professional journals, personal contacts, direct mailing to               department heads and announcements at national mathematics and                  education conferences.  Seminars held during the term of the                    summer school will be led by active mathematicians carefully                    selected for their strong interest in working with minority                     students.  Special colloquium talks will be scheduled regularly.                In addition, the strongest student participants will be brought                 to the national meeting of the Mathematical Association of                      America/American Mathematical Society in San Francisco in                       January, 1991.",
