 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research award will support a graduate student                in anthropology in a field study of the role of secrecy and                     knowledge in a highland group in Papua New Guinea.  Most previous               studies have examined reciprocal exchanges as the basis of social               life in this sort of group; this research looks at the refusal to               exchange, by keeping secret valuable practical knowledge, to see                how that constrains social relations.  Methods include                          participant observation and structured interviewing.                                                                                                            This research is important because it modifies the position that                shared knowledge is the basis of social life in small societies.                In fact the possession of secret knowledge is an important fact                 in every social system, and this project will shed light on how                 one small-scale society uses secrecy to establish and maintain                  social relations.  The case study will be valuable as a                         comparison to small-group studies of knowledge exchange in group                process.",
