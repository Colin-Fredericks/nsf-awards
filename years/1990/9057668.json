The broad goals of this                                 investigator's research are concerned with understanding                        the underlying mechanisms that affect physical and                              chemical processes used to treat water and wastewater.                          She is particularly interested in to the role of particle                       chemistry and physics in coagulation, filtration,                               adsorption and disinfection and in the use of ozone as a                        destabilization agent and disinfectant in dilute aqueous                        systems.                                                                                                                                                        Results of this research are likely to be utilized in                           engineering design of processes and systems for removal of                      contaminants from municipal and industrial water supplies.                      The results are also potentially applicable to formulating                      models that track particles suspended in water as they                          move through groundwater aquifers.",
