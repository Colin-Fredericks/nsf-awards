 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an investigation of the  mechanics of ridge faulting.                   The Principal Investigators will develop lithospheric deformation               models that explicitly consider faulting processes on a set of                  discrete faults.  Three phases of the investigation are: (1)  to                examine the basic mechanics of a single normal fault under ridge                tectonic stresses and subsequent lithospheric deformation, (2)                  to investigate the mechanical interaction among multiple faults                 in the crust and its effects on faulting patterns near a mid-                   ocean ridge, and (3)  to apply the theoretical results from phase               1 and 2 to determine the characteristics of faulting in well                    surveyed areas of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  The objectives of                    studying a multiply-faulted system are to test the hypothesis                   that the close spacing of near-ridge faults os the result of                    mechanical interactions between faults, and that the width of the               rift valley at a slow-spareding ridge is controlled by the                      thickness of the lithospheric plate.",
