 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of separation and purification has been                                revolutionized in the past decade by the development of                         membrane systems.  These have received much notice for their                    direct integration into the traditional chemical industry as                    partial or total replacement for costly and complex processes                   such as azeotropic or extractive distillation.  New                             technologies are rapidly being incorporated into modern                         chemical engineering with applications found in the expanding                   fields of biological engineering/biotechnology; hazardous                       waste management; specialty chemical and biochemical                            production; food and beverage processing; and, reuse and                        recovery systems engineering.                                                                                                                                   This project focuses on the development of instructional and                    laboratory experiences in membrane pervaporation processes.                     The project goal is to provide students with both theoretical                   and working knowledge of the membrane pervaporation process.                    This is accomplished through a supplement to a current course,                  a new course, and the introduction of new laboratory                            experiments covering the fundamentals of membrane                               pervaporation and the operation and application of this                         process.  Experiments illustrate the concepts of the driving                    force for pervaporative mass transport through membranes, the                   mechanism for transport as represented by the solution-                         diffusion model, the parameters quantifying membrane                            separation, and basic membrane material science.                                                                                                                The award is being matched by an equal amount from the                          principal investigator's institution.",
