 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue a longitudinal study of mathematics                  achievement of eleventh-grade Chinese, Japanese, and American students          who were studied in 1980 and 1984 when they were in the first and fifth         grades.  Data were collected from achievement tests in mathematics and          reading and from tests of cognitive ability; from interviews with               mothers, children, and teachers about their beliefs, expectations and           practices related to mathematics; and from observations of the                  children's classrooms.  These data will be used in an attempt to                understand early correlates of later achievement in mathematics.  New           information will be collected from the students, and from their                 mothers, fathers and teachers about current attitudes and beliefs about         mathematics evaluations of prior experiences with mathematics, prospects        for using mathematics in the future, and other factors relevant to              their education in mathematics.  It is expected that data will be               obtained from approximately 600 of the 720 first-graders who were               originally studied.  To extend the representativeness of the results, a         larger sample of 1500 eleventh-graders will respond to group-                   administered tests of achievement and to selected questions from the            student interview.                                                                                                                                              The goal of this research is to increase our understanding of prior and         contemporary influences on achievement in mathematics so that effective         suggestions may be made for the improvement of mathematics education in         the United States.",
