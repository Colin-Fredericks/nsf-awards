 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deadly Toxic yeasts secrete proteins that are toxic to other               yeasts. The P.I.s interested in evaluating the role of toxic                    yeasts in the organization of natural communities of yeasts                     species.  The investigators past work has shown that these yeasts               are relatively common in nature with at least one species present               in all communities examined (i.e. the distinct yeasts communities               associated with stem necroses of various cacti, slime fluxes of                 trees and decaying tissue of fruits).  The P.I.'s will                          investigate two different yeasts, Pichia Kluyveri and P.                        thermotolerans, that occur in rotting fruits and decaying stems                 of cactus respectively.  The system of Toxic P. Kluveri is                      especially interesting since it has a very flexible genetic                     system that displays species specific killing genotypes.  In                    order to understand and link the knowledge on both the genetics                 and ecology the investigators will do an in depth ecological                    survey that assays genotypes of P. Kluyveri in conjunction with                 he resistance phenotypes of associated yeast species.  This work,               in parallel with detailed laboratory genetic analysis and                       field/laboratory experiments designed to reveal the adaptive                    significance of specific killer genotypes should allow the                      evaluation of the importance of toxin production to the                         organization of the community.  The proposed work with P.                       thermotoloerans will provide comparative information from a                     relative different system; an system that is restricted terms of                hosts (saguaro cactus) and geography (Sonoran Desert).  The                     overall goal is to understand the fundamental reasons for                       community structure.  Deadly toxins in yeasts represent an                      opportunity to study a case where the mechanism of interference                 competition is clear and unambiguous.",
