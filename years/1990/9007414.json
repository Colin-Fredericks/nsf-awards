 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to investigate an interesting and robust                    phenomenon of group interaction, the \"discontinuity effect.\"                    This effect refers to the fact that people interacting as group                 members are consistently more competitive than when acting alone.               A number of interesting possibilities will be tested in this                    series of laboratory investigations, most of which make use of                  variables with considerable real-world impact.  In one of the                   studies, for example, the racial composition of the group members               will be studied.  In another study, the effects of greed and fear               are studied in the group or individual allocation of resources.                 The theoretical and practical implications of the work are                      interesting and valuable.  The investigators are first rate, and                well known for their important contributions to this area.  As                  such, the project shows every sign of providing an important                    contribution to knowledge of the actions of individuals in                      groups.",
