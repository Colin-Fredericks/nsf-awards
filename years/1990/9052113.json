 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computers with traditional architectures suffer from an inherent                limitation known as the \"von Neumann bottleneck.\"  Instructions are             retrieved from memory and are then executed sequentially, one-by-               one, by the Central Processing Unit (CPU).  However, the CPU is                 generally capable of higher speeds than the memory sub-system in                which the program resides, so the system as a whole is slowed by                the rate at which instructions can be \"fetched.\"  Furthermore, many             algorithms have portions which could be executed at the same time               or in \"parallel\" if facilities to do this exist.  Except for a few              expensive special-purpose machines, computers have been Single                  Instruction Single Data (SISD) processors, performing commands one              at a time without the possibility of concurrency.  There are                    applications which cannot be computerized without simultaneous                  execution of many instructions involving separate vectors or                    partitions of the data.  A modern Electrical Engineering curriculum             should include the application of parallel techniques to problems               at the frontiers of computing speed, including image and speech                 analysis, high speed arithmetic, waveform synthesis and signal                  processing.  Therefore, this project establishes a laboratory                   dedicated to parallel computing using general purpose PCs as hosts              to multiprocessor boards.  This provides maximum flexibility in                 configuring systems, the opportunity for incremental growth and the             immediate ability for undergraduates to take advantage of new and               emerging technology.  The award is being matched by an equal amount             from the principal investigator's institution.",
