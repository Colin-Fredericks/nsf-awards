 "awd_abstract_narration": "The polychlorinated biphenyls are a highly stable family of                     compounds that have accumulated in the environment over the past                50 years at sites of their production, use, storage, or disposal.               Their persistence in soil and sediment and possible effects on                  human health have sparked an intense interest in developing a                   safe, economical means for their destruction.  It is our goal to                use recombinant DNA technologies to develop a superior                          biochemical process for the microbial destruction of PCBs.                      Research by Dr. Unterman and his former colleagues at GE has                    clearly demonstrated the existence of at least two complementary                classes of aerobic PCB-degrading bacteria and that use of both of               these classes in concert can effect a much greater extent of PCB                destruction.  It is Envirogen's ultimate goal to combine the PCB-               degradative genes from two of these strains, respectively, into                 one superior, PCB-degradative microbe.  The GE group has now                    cloned the genes from a Class II organism.  Although the genes                  from Class I microbes have been isolated, we will isolate, clone,               and genetically engineer the genes that encode the enzymes                      responsible for PCB catabolism from Acinetobacter strain P6, the                best Class I microorganism isolated to date.",
