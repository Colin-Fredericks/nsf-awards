 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint Mass Spectrometry Facility has been created by the                      Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering and Chemistry              at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC).  The                  objectives of the Facility are to support and promote chemical                  research and teaching in mass spectrometry at UNC.  The Facility                will provide the capability for identification and structural                   characterization of many different classes of compounds.  Specific              aims of some of the projects of the major users are to gain insight             into mechanisms responsible for the activation of polycyclic                    aromatics to ultimate carcinogens; to understand sterol metabolic               pathways in the plant parasites; to synthesize nongenetic proteins;             to characterize intermediates in the biosynthesis of ecodysteroids              in insects and to identify neuropeptides controlling insect                     development; to understand the role of -carboxyglutamyl (Gla)                   residues in blood coagulation processes; to characterize potent                 enzyme inhibitors and to separate and identify products of                      chlorination and ionization of humics in water.  For these                      purposes, an mass spectrometer is needed that is capable of high-               resolution and accurate mass measurements, chemical ionization,                 collisional activation ionization, collisional activation, gas-                 chromatography and fast-atom-bombardment.  The most appropriate                 instrument is a hybrid-mass spectrometer.",
