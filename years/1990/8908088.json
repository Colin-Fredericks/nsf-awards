 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rational synthesis of new types of compounds that exhibit                   unusual structures and reactivity patterns is the essense of                    chemical research.  The most powerful structural tool is a                      single crystal x-ray diffractometer. The analysis of the x-ray                  data can help to correctly assign the solid state structure of                  a molecule.                                                                                                                                                     This award will allow the Department of Chemistry at Michigan                   State University to acquire a new x-ray diffractometer and                      associated software for research in the following areas of                      chemistry:                                                                                                                                                      1.  The structure of alkalides and electrides;                                  2.  Design and synthesis of new hosts for crystalline                               molecular complexes;                                                        3.  The synthesis, structure, reactivity and photochemistry of                      bidentate fluorophosphine and fluoroarylphosphine                               transition metal complexes;                                                 4.  Novel structures in photochemistry;                                         5.  Design and x-ray studies of new low-valent transition                           metal clusters and solids;                                                  6.  Novel intermetallic alloys through metal/chalcogenide                           complexes; and                                                              7.  Structure determination of new organic and inorganic                            compounds, either synthetic or isolated from nature, in                         support of a variety of organic and inorganic research                          projects.",
