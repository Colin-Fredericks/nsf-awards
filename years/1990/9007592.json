 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the guidance of Dr. Kwang-Chi Chang, Ms. Li Liu will                      combine archaeological research in China with laboratory analysis               at Harvard University.  The results will form the basis for Ms.                 Liu's doctoral dissertation.  Ms. Liu will collaborate with                     Chinese archaeologists and participate in the ongoing excavation                of the site of Kangjia which is located in North China and dates                to the third millennium B.C.  This large site - the remains of a                village - covers an area of ca. 190,000 square meters.  Ms. Liu                 will first conduct a surface survey and map the distribution of                 features and other material.  She will follow this with                         excavation in selected areas.  Special attention will be focussed               on ceramics and she will conduct stylistic and mineralogical                    analyses.  Stone tools will be examined to determine function and               faunal remains will be studied.  Carbon isotope analysis will be                conducted on skeletal remains to provide information on                         prehistoric diet.                                                                                                                                               The Neolithic period in China provided the base from which                      Chinese civilization emerged.  As such, it is interesting both in               its own right and in a comparative context.  Working in other                   parts of the world, archaeologists have attempted to define the                 stages and processes which led to increasing cultural complexity.               Because so little of the archaeological work conducted in China                 is accessible to non-Chinese, it has not been possible to fit                   this important part of the world into the broader pattern.  Ms.                 Liu's research will help to remedy this defect.                                                                                                                 This research is important for several reasons.  First, it will                 provide Western archaeologists with a body of data of great                     general interest.  Secondly, it will help to build ties with                    Chinese archaeologists and introduce them to a variety of                       valuable methods and techniques used in the West.  Finally, this                grant will aid in the training of an extremely promising                        scientist.",
