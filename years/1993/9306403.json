 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a career advancement award Dr. Fautin will learn modern                 methods of molecular phylogenetics, including restriction                       endonuclease analyses of mitochondrial DNA and nucleotide                       sequencing in the laboratory of Dr. Deborah Smith at the University             of Kansas.  The focus of the work is on the phylogeny and taxonomy              of selected sea anemones, including those that are symbiotic with               clownfishes and some that harbor algae internally.  Mitochondrial               DNA mutations among the several species of sea anemones will be                 compared and used for the reconstruction of phylogenetic                        relationships among these marine animals.  Molecular data will be               integrated with traditional morphological characters used to                    distinguish species and genera of anemones.  One long term goal is              to compare the pattern of species divergences in sea anemones with              that for their symbiotic fish associates, on the one hand, and with             the associated symbiotic algae on the other, in order to explore                mechanisms of coevolutionary change.                                            %%%                                                                                  Symbioses are biologically challenging phenomena, including                those between sea anemones and their internal (algae) and external              associates (clownfishes or anemonefishes).  Dr. Fautin in a career              advancement award is adding new molecular data (DNA mutations) to               traditional morphological knowledge of sea anemones in order to                 improve the taxonomy of these marine organisms and to explore                   patterns of phylogenetic relationship among the several genera                  worldwide.  A robust phylogeny for the sea anemones will then                   permit study of the pattern of coevolutionary divergence among the              algae and fishes associated with these fascinating creatures.",
