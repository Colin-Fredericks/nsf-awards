 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative                          research between Benny D. Freeman of North Carolina State                       University, and Claudine Noel of the Ecole Superieure for                       Physics and Industrial Chemistry in Paris, France. The                          research focuses on mainchain liquid crystalline polymers                       (LCPs).  The investigators propose to determine the effect                      of systematic structure changes on phase morphology, thermal                    properties, and penetrant sorption and transport properties                     of LCPs.                                                                                                                                                        LCPs offer promise as thermal or chemical resistant barrier                     films and coatings of potential use to the chemical                             processing industry.  Recent studies of LCPs suggest that                       these materials are among the most impermeable barrier                          polymers currently available.  However, practical                               difficulties have limited the success of studies to date in                     decoupling chemical and morphological effects on the                            transport properties of small molecules through these                           polymers.  The investigators propose to advance                                 understanding of the effects of LCPs' molecular structure on                    penetrant sorption and transport properties and, in turn,                       determine their high barrier properties.  At North Carolina                     State, the sorption and transport properties of small                           molecules in these polymers will be studied; whereas, the                       French research group will conduct studies on                                   characterization and their thermal properties.  The novel                       polymeric materials for this study will be provided by                          Hoechst Celanese and Miles Laboratories.  The collaboration                     takes advantage of the expertise of the investigators and                       complementary approaches to this problem.",
