 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310043  Peffley    An important prerequisite of democratic government is that citizens  have the opportunity to hold elected officials accountable for  their actions.  In order for such opportunities to be effective,  however, citizens must base judgments of political responsibility  on accessible and relevant information provided by the mass media.   Since most citizens rely heavily on television for such  information, a growing body of research in political science has  begun to investigate the way the network news broadcasts often  prevent citizens from making the most meaningful assessments of  political responsibility.  Past research, however, has not examined  the importance of visual stimuli in affecting citizens' judgments  of who is responsible for various national problems.  This is  unfortunate given that television is primarily a visual medium  where important political information is presented through visual,  as opposed to textual or auditory, channels.      This doctoral dissertation research investigation represents one of  the first systematic investigations of the importance of visual  images on citizens assessments of political responsibility  conducted in political science.  In addition, while prior studies  have focused extensively upon assessments between individual and  societal responsibility, this research will investigate the  influence that the media has upon citizens' evaluations of the  president, and, to this date, no such studies have been conducted  concerning Congress and congressional incumbents.  Consequently,  this investigation will also investigate how coverage from the  network news media influences viewers' evaluations of the  institutions of the Presidency and Congress as well as the  respective incumbents. Specifically, the researcher conducts a  content analysis of network news coverage of important political  issues as well as a series of experiments intended to fill in these  gaps left by prior research.  ***",
