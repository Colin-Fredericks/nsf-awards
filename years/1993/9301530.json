Materials research has been identified as  a high-priority area of emphasis at Washington State University.   Two cross-college organizations-The Center for Materials Research  and the Materials Science Program-have been recently established to  address the interdisciplinary nature of Materials Science.  The  Center for Materials Research which consists of 19 senior  participants was formed with the purpose of encouraging  collaborative, cross-disciplinary research projects in the area of  materials and applied condensed mater science.  The Materials  Science Program is the educational arm of the materials science  thrust at Washington State University. The Materials Science  Program was initiated in the Fall of 1990 and consequently is the  most recently created Ph.D. program in the University.  It is one  of the few truly interdisciplinary programs in the nation as it  involves active participation from both Engineering and Science  departments.  Twenty-two faculty members, from 6 departments  participate in the Program.       This instrument will permit conventional imaging in both  bright-field and dark-field modes, high spatial resolution imaging,  electron diffraction, and microanalysis of microstructural features  in TEM specimens.  A heating stage and temperature controller are  also requested, which will enable us to perform in-situ heating  studies in the electron microscope.  These studies are essential  for our research programs in the areas of particle coarsening of  metallic alloys and metal induced embrittlement.  Acquisition of a  transmission electron microscope is essential for research  activities in a number of departments within the University,  including; Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Physics,  Chemistry, Geology, Chemical Engineer ing, and Electrical  Engineering.  There are a total of 15 graduate students whose  research will directly benefit from the acquisition of a  transmission electron microscope.  In addition, there are about 14  graduate students involved in the other projects whose research  would significantly benefit from microstructural studies involving  TEM.  In addition a TEM on campus will provide substantial benefit  as an instructional instrument for both graduate and undergraduate  students, exposing them to modern analytical instrumentation which  is not presently available to them.  ***",
