 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significant changes are being made in order to improve and                      modernize the general chemistry course.  The most important is                  the conversion to a laboratory-centered, inquiry-based                          approach, in which important concepts are being \"discovered\" by                 the students in the laboratory before they are discussed in                     lecture.  As a result, students are becoming much more involved                 in the course, and the relation between experimental results                    and theory is more apparent.  In addition, a new \"computers in                  chemistry\" component is being introduced to supplement the                      lectures and laboratories.  The course is being enhanced                        further by integrating the computers into the laboratory,                       utilizing computer-interfaced equipment.  The use of computers                  in the laboratory is introducing students to modern methods of                  data acquisition and analysis while improving the discovery                     process in a variety of ways, including the following:  1.                      Experimental data is being gathered more quickly and                            accurately, and then being pooled and stored for subsequent                     analysis.  2. Laboratory procedures are being monitored while                   in progress, and then modified or repeated as needed.  3.                       Graphing and interpretation of data is being greatly facili-                    tated, enabling the students to more readily see the patterns                   and relationships that are so critical to the discovery-based                   method.",
