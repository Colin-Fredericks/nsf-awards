 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biological                       Sciences at the University of Tulsa to continue a successful                    REU SITE.  The program will help train undergraduate                            students in the philosophy, mechanics, and execution of                         scientific research.  This project will enhance an already                      strong program in undergraduate research participation, and                     will extend this program into the summer. Another goal is to                    enhance opportunities for participation in scientific                           research for members of underrepresented groups. The                            Undergraduate Summer Research Program will consist of a                         research workshop, independent research projects, weekly                        group meetings, invited speakers, and a research colloquium.                    The research workshop will introduce the students to the                        philosophy and mechanics of the various fields in biology                       represented by the participating faculty. One result of the                     workshop will be the development by each student of an                          individual research project. These projects will focus on                       nectivore foraging ecology, reproductive behavioral ecology,                    vertebrate reproductive physiology (ecology & evolution),                       algal evolution & systematics, or cyanobacterial                                microbiology. The students will complete their projects over                    the course of the summer. The weekly group meetings will                        provide a forum for review of literature, progress reports                      on research projects, and for solving problems that arise                       during the course of the projects. The invited speakers will                    expose the students to a wider variety of view points in                        biology than is available through the participating faculty.                    Finally, students will communicate the results of their                         projects and experience critical peer review through the                        research colloquium.",
