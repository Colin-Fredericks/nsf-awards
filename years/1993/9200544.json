Moreover, ultrafast laser techniques                                            have been developed that now allow                                              the measurement of charge transport                                             over micron and nanometer dimensions                                            with picosecond and femtosecond                                                 temporal resolution.  The objective                                             of this proposal, simply stated, is                                             to take advantage of these advances                                             in materials growth and in ultrafast                                            laser spectroscopy to study,                                                    measure, optimize and control charge                                            transport and space-charge field                                                formation in semiconductor                                                      structures over nanometer spatial                                               dimensions. The intent is not only                                              to improve the transport, but                                                   simultaneously to enhance the                                                   magnitudes and speeds of the optical                                            nonlinearities that result from such                                            transport.                                                                      Future advances in the development                                              of photonic and electronic systems,                                             and interconnects between the two,                                              may well rely on, and be limited by,                                            the ability to measure and control                                              charge formation, screening and                                                 changes in optical properties that                                              accompany such transport. Carrier                                               transport over these dimensions will                                            occur on sub-picosecond time scales                                             and may even be ballistic. Moreover,                                            even modest voltages applied across                                             such small dimensions will produce                                              huge fields and may result in hot                                               carriers.  While much is known about                                            the relaxation of nonequilibrium                                                carriers in energy within the bands,                                            little is known about transport                                                 under these conditions of the                                                   effects of that transport on the                                                nonlinear optical response.                                                     Since the idea is to engineer the                                               structure to improve the transport                                              and to enhance the optical                                                      nonlinearities that result from such                                            transport, these studies will                                                   require the growth, investigation                                               and optimization of several unique                                              and non-traditional structures and                                              materials for which growth                                                      techniques have not been extensively                                            developed.  Moreover, we will be                                                engaged in an active iterative                                                  process in which the optical-based                                              transport information will be                                                   correlated with structural                                                      characterization and fed back into                                              the structural design and growth to                                             obtain material and structures with                                             improved transport and transport-                                               related optical properties.  In this                                            way, structures can be                                                          deterministically designed and                                                  fabricated with a firm fundamental                                              understanding of the influence of                                               the characteristics under our                                                   control (strain, piezo-electric                                                 fields, dopants, interfaces,                                                    barriers, order, etc.) on the useful                                            properties of the resulting                                                     structure.",
