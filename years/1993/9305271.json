 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305271  Rich   This grant is focussed on increasing our understanding of RNA.   The major approach used in this work is x-ray diffraction studies  of single crystals of RNA components, as well as RNA binding  proteins.  X-ray diffraction studies allows one to determine the  three-dimensional structure of the molecule.  The major  experimental challenge in this work is to obtain crystals that  have suitable degrees of regularity, so that the analysis can be  carried out to uncover fine details of molecular structure.  %%%  RNA plays a very important role in biological systems.  Not only  does it act to convey information from DNA that results in  directing the synthesis of proteins, but it also forms a number  of structural elements that form part of the machinery of the  cell.  The goal of this research is to crystallize segments of  RNA that contain various structural motifs.  These elements  determine the way that RNA folds upon itself or forms in a number  of different conformations.  RNA has recently been shown to have  enzymatic activity.  The structure of these \"ribozymes\" will also  be studied. In general, understanding the three-dimensional  structure of the RNA may lead to an enhanced awareness of how the  molecule functions in its biological context.  Knowing the  structure of proteins that bind to RNA and the manner in which  they specifically interact also enhances our understanding of its  role.  ***",
