 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two year project will implement the Jaime Escalante Math                   Project at Hiram Johnson High School and its West Campus and                    Feeder Middle Schools in the Sacramento City Unified School                     District.  During year-one two HJHS teachers will be trained in                 the methodology and strategies used by Mr. Escalante.  This will                be done in the academic year during a series of Saturday                        workshops taught by Mr. Escalante.  Then, in the summer these                   project associates and Mr. Escalante will team teach three                      classes of 30 students each.  During the second year of the                     project six more teachers will be trained in JEMP and then                      practice these new methods and strategies during the second                     summer in classroom settings.                                                                                                                                   Also included are student tutorial sessions Monday through                      Thursday during the second academic year and a series of one-day                presentations on JEMP to elementary school teachers in the SCUSD                which are Feeders for the middle schools.
