 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves studies of novel magneto-optically active                 materials.  The structures include artificially structured magnetic             multilayers, thin films and nanoscale clusters of nanocrystalline               composites, and manganese-based compounds and films with                        anisotropic structures.  The work will focus on 1) the                          relationships between magnetization reversal, domain dynamics, and              nanostructures of the films, and 2) fundamental magneto-optical                 properties of novel phases synthesized to produce significant                   magneto-optic effects.  A range of magnetization measurements will              be performed.  In addition, spectroscopic ellipsometry will be used             to fully characterize the dielectric tensor properties of the                   materials.  In selected cases, photoemission measurements will be               used to study the electronic structure of the new compounds.  The               measurements will increase the understanding of fundamental                     relationships between electronic structure and magneto-optics in                several new classes of transition metal compounds.                              %%%                                                                             Magnetic thin films and particulate magnetic materials are being                synthesized and studied to determine their megneto-optic properties             -- which are critical in determining their utility as magnetic                  storage media.  The objective of the research is to prepare new                 materials with enhanced properties and potential for use in optical             storage discs, computer hard discs, and other form of magnetic                  storage device.  The fundamental properties of the materials will               be investigated by magnetic and optical spectroscopy techniques.",
