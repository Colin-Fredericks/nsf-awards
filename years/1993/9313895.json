A major contributing  factor has been the paucity of opportunities for significant  numbers of competent minorities to receive high caliber educational  training at the best academic institutions, and insufficient  exposure to high caliber scientists and research laboratories.  In  an effort to correct some of these deficiencies, the Minorities  Affairs Committee (MAC) of the American Society for Cell Biology  (ASCB) has set forth the following objectives:  1, to provide  travel grants to underrepresented minorities from minority and  majority institutions to attend the annual meeting of the ASCB,  which provides recipients with the opportunity to attend symposia,  workshops, poster sessions, and to interact with peers and leading  ASCB scientists; 2, to provide tuition, laboratory fees, housing  and travel support to minority students and scientists to attend  academic and/or technical courses and workshops at high quality  academic sites such as the Marine Biological Laboratory and Friday  Harbor Laboratory summer courses; 3, to support summer trainees and  visiting professors in research laboratories offering state-of-the-  art programs in cell and molecular biology; 4, to support  orientation meetings of the ASCB minorities attending the annual  meeting, mini-scientific symposia and workshops, and an annual ASCB  breakfast meeting during the annual meeting; 5, to provide funds to  support essential secretarial and managerial services provided by  the ASCB executive office and printing costs to inform the  scientific community of opportunitites for underrepresented  minorities.  ***    9313895  Wyche    Many reasons account for the underrepresentation of minorities in  important fields of biological sciences.
