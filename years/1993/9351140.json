These systems will be  introduced into both introductory and advanced laboratory courses  and undergraduate research programs of all four science  departments.  Hamline University has initiated a three-stage plan  for introducing high performance computing (HPC) into the  undergraduate science curriculum. During Stage 1, which is underway  and financed entirely by Hamline University, eight Sun workstations  and one server were purchased and connected to Internet, a science  faculty training program was initiated, and HPC teaching modules  are being developed. During Stage 2, hardware and software holdings  will be expanded, teaching modules will be introduced, tested,  refined and expanded, cooperative faculty and student HPC-supported  research programs with remote institutions will be developed, an  HPC-focused science curriculum will be designed, and course content  and teaching methodologies will be further modified to incorporate  HPC. This proposal requests funds to support Stage 2. During Stage  3, a new science building with an HPC-focused curriculum as its  architectural theme will be designed and constructed, and HPC use  will be expanded into social science fields. Experiences gained  from this program will enable Hamline to serve as a regional  HPC/science curriculum resource center.",
