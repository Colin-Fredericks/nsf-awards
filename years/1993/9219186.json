 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed studies is to understand how T cell               differentiation and function are regulated during development.  Two             different, but complementary approaches will be taken to                        investigate this issue thoroughly.  First, the phenotypic and                   functional properties of peripheral T cells arising in vivo from                defined populations of fetal or adult T cell precursors will be                 compared.  Chimeric animals will be created in which                            differentiation occurs (a) in the adult thymus after intrathymic                injection of precursor cells or (b) in the intact fetal thymus                  following transplantation under the host kidney capsules.  These                experiments will reveal, for the first time, whether the                        acquisition of immunocompetence is controlled by developmental                  changes in the T cell precursor population. The second approach                 will be to investigate the mechanisms underlying functional                     differences between neonatal and adult T cells.  The roles of                   cytokines, cell types, and lymphokine gene expression in the                    differential lymphokine secretion patterns of neonatal and adult T              cells will be examined.  This will provide novel information on the             biochemical and molecular events mediating neonatal                             immunoincompetence vs adult immunocompetence.  Taken together,                  these studies will provide valuable new insights into the                       development of the T cell lineage.                                              %%%                                                                             Of central importance to understanding immunity is understanding                how the ability to mount an immune response (immunocompetence)                  arises and is maintained during development.  There is compelling               evidence that developmental changes in the cells that give rise to              the array of adult T-lymphocytes are important.  At present, there              is no clear understanding of the mechanisms controlling T-cell                  developmental changes.  The goals of this project are to determine              whether specific developmental changes in T-cell precursor                      populations control the acquisition of immunocompetence and to                  study the molecular and biochemical events responsible for                      functional differences between neonatal T cells which are not                   immunocompetent and adult T cells which are.  This research should              contribute important new information about the development of the               immune system.",
