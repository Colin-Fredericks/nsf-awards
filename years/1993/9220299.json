 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czechoslovakia research project between Dr. Eric J.                   Amis of the University of Southern California and Dr. Marian                    Sedlak of the Institute of Experimental Physics, Slovak Academy of              Sciences, Kosice will examine the properties of polyelectrolytes in             solution without added salt.  Unscreened electrostatic interactions             influence polyelectrolyte behavior in complex and specific ways.                In this work, the researchers combine two proven methods for                    investigating polymer dynamics: dynamic light scattering and                    dynamic viscoelasticity.  The combination, with overlapping time                windows and unique sensitivities, should reduce the difficulties of             interpreting either experiment alone.  The researchers will also                study the   mechanism of formation of multichain domains in                     polyelectrolytes, with emphasis on the dependence of                            polyelectrolyte structure and dynamics on concentration, molecular              weight, charge density, electrostatic screening, chain conformation,            and solvent dielectric permitivities.                                                                                                                           This project in polymer research fulfills the program objective of              advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading experts in                   Eastern Europe and the United States to combine complementary                   talents and pool resources in areas of strong mutual interest and               competence.",
