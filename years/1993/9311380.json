 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311380  Robertson       This proposal will examine the effect of environmental  factors and diversity of denitrifying bacteria on the spatial and  temporal variability of denitrification in agricultural and  grassland ecosystems.  Specific questions to be addressed include  1) to what extent, and under what circumstances, is denitrifier  community composition different among ecosystems with different  nitrous oxide production potentials?, 2) do denitrifiers from  different ecosystems produce nitrous oxide at different rates?, and  3) does spatial and temporal variability in nitrous oxide  production reflect differences in dominant denitrifier populations  as well as differences in environmental controls?  These questions  will be addressed by sampling soil from ecosystems that differ in  chemical conditions that affect nitrous oxide flux rates,  incubating to characterize nitrous oxide flux rates, and  denitrifier isolation to characterize community structure.  %%%       Denitrifiers are bacteria that, during anaerobic respiration,  convert nitrogen from a form available to plants to gaseous nitrous  oxide not available to plants.  Thus, denitrifiers have a direct  impact on soil fertility and plant production.  Denitrification  also is important because the nitrous oxide is an important  greenhouse gas  and a catalyst of statospheric ozone decay.   Environmental factors affecting denitrification processes have been  examined, but their relative importances and the significance of  particular denitrifier species composition is not known.  This  study will all evaluation of the relative contributions of  environmental controls and denitrifier diversity to nitrous oxide  flux rates.  ***",
