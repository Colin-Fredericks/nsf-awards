 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed work consists of testing the hypothesis that                       recruitment pulses to rocky intertidal barnacle populations are                 caused by the collision of upwelling fronts with the rocky                      intertidal zone.  It is hypothesized that the upwelling front is a              place of convergence, and that larvae of intertidal barnacles                   accumulate there.  To test this hypothesis, knowledge of the                    temporal history of the position and vertical structure of an                   upwelling front is required, along with knowledge of the                        distribution and abundance of larvae in the water column, and their             recruitment success during periods of active upwelling and                      relaxation from upwelling.  The PIs propose to address this issue               through a series of field measurements consisting of: (1) use of                shipboard net tows together with temperature, salinity, and                     velocity measurements along a transect off Monterey, California, on             six short cruises during each of two upwelling seasons; (2) moored              measurements of temperature and wind; (3) benthic monitoring in the             intertidal zone; (4) shore-based measurements of temperature and                salinity; and, (5) satellite AVHRR data.",
