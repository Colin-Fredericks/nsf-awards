 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303024  Hoffmann       Based on current research a Caltech, it has been determined  that the redox cycle of Fe in near-shore continental troposphere  involves both dissolved and aerosol surface species and it is  controlled primarily by level of oxidizable organic compounds that  co-exist with the various phases and species containing Fe(III).   These co-existing organic compounds undergo thermal and photo-  assisted oxidation by Fe(III) species (soluble complexes and metal  oxide polymorphs) to yield carboxylic acids.  This chemical  interdependency is consistent with the strong correlation observed  between the concentrations of Fe(II) and CH3 carbon dioxide in  marine stratus clouds.  In addition, irradiated ambient aerosol  particles have been shown to produce relatively large  concentrations of h2o2 when electron donors such as oxalate and  formate are present.  These results suggest that illuminated clouds  and haze aerosol may provide an in situ source of hydrogen peroxide  to air parcels in the troposphere.  This result is a major finding  of significance to global troposphere chemistry in regards to  sources of oxidizing capacity in the atmosphere.       In light of the on-going research (NSF Grant ATM-9015775 on  the dynamic chemistry of iron in the atmosphere, the following  research objectives have been established: 1) experimentally  determine the various chemical forms and oxidation states of Fe in  cloud-, fog- and rainwater collected from marine and continental  (both rural and urban) environments, 2) characterize the solid-  phase of Fe and Mn, which participate in redox cycles in  atmospheric water droplets, and trace their sources to the  atmosphere.",
