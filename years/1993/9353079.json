Ten site-based School Centered Education (SCE) planning groups will  meet by area to conduct area self studies. Concurrent meetings of  identified stakeholders will assess the needs of higher education,  technical education and the workforce. The groups will meet to  identify and develop strategies that will result in an increase in  student enrollment and achievement in mathematics and science  classes and successfully impact those entering college and the  workforce. Recommendations from these groups will form the basis of  a comprehensive plan for systemic reform in the Dallas Independent  School District.  ***",
