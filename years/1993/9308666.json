 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308666  Ferrand  This is an award to support research, the  objective of which is to develop effective  approaches to accommodating the influence  that natural heterogeneity of soils has on  the movement of non-aqueous phase liquids  through them.  The investigator plans on  conducting her experiments in relatively  large-scale, laboratory soil flumes packed  with heterogeneous soils.  Fluid saturations  and pressures will be monitored and recorded  by time-domain reflectometry and  tensiometer/transducer systems to establish  spatially-averaged steady-state and transient  relationships of the fluids moving through  the soils.  Coarse-grid simulations of the  experiment will be performed to determine the  best way in which these relationships can be  used to accurately predict fluid  displacements.    The proposal leading to this award was  submitted in response to NSF 92-122, Research  Initiation Awards Program Announcement and  Guidelines.  Results are expected to improve  models used in engineering design of  remediation processes and systems for  decontamination of contaminated soils.",
