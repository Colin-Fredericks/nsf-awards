 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Study of Mesospheric Radar Scattering                                         In this one year program of research, an explanation will be sought             for the disagreement between motions inferred from the analysis of              incoherent scatter and partial reflection radar data as measured                during the Arecibo Initiative on the Dynamics of the Atmosphere,                March through May, 1989 (AIDA '89).  The principal data sources to              be utilized come from the Arecibo observatory UHF incoherent                    scatter radar (ISR) observations, from the Utah State University                imaging doppler interferometry (IDI) MF radar and from the Geospace             Research meteor wind radar (MWR).  The investigation will                       concentrate on the scattering mechanisms involved, which, at least              in the case of the IDI, are as yet not fully understood.  The IDI               scattering points may originate from turbulent eddies in the mean               flow, or they may be specular reflection from individual gravity                wave fronts.  To address this problem the investigators will rely               heavily on the considerable body of knowledge available on the                  propagation of waves in turbulent media, and on an existing archive             of \"snapshots\" of small scale motions at mesospheric - lower                    thermospheric altitudes as revealed by high resolution photography              of rocket released chemical trails.",
