 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307601  Wang       This research concerns two-scale dilation equations, which  describe the two-scale behavior characteristic of scaling  functions.  These equations arise in a wide variety of  applications, including wavelets, sub-division schemes for  computer generation of curves and surfaces, and fractal geometry  (iterated function systems - IFS). The principal investigator  will develop techniques based on representations of the scaling  function in terms of an infinite matrix product expansion, which  can be used to establish an algorithm for constructing scaling  functions, and to analyze their regularity, integrability, and  dimensionality.  Thus far, in order to ensure convergence of the  infinite matrix product,a Contractivity Assumption has been  imposed.  This Assumption is stronger than necessary, and the PI  is investigating weaker assumptions involving bounded semi-groups  of matrices, and an average contractivity factor as determined by  the Lyapunov exponent.  This also leads to questions regarding  the structure of bounded semi-groups of matrices.  The PI has  also developed techniques to study self-similar lattice tilings,  which arises from multi-dimensional orthonormal wavelets.       The PI intends to study the following:  (1)  surface  generation:  sliding window method; (2)  existence of integrable  solutions; (3) dilation equations with non-negative coefficients;  (4)  self-similar lattice tilings; (5)  the Finiteness Conjecture  of Daubechies and Lagarias.       This activity had substantial potential for application in  many areas, including compression algorithms.  ***",
