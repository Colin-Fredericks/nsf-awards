 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal request funding for a workshop to evaluate the               state of our understanding of earthworm ecology in North America.               The earthworm fauna and their role in ecosystem function in the                 western hemisphere are poorly known compared with other regions of              Earth, especially Europe and Oceania.  Although it is widely                    recognized that earthworms can exert significant influence on                   physical, chemical and biological processes in soils, it is not                 clear how generally results from other biogeographic regions apply              to ecological conditions and earthworm assemblages (particularly                native earthworm fauna) prevalent in North America.                             The focus of this workshop will be on the influence of earthworms               on soil processes in forest, rangeland and crop ecosystems over the             range of climatic and soil conditions that occur in North America,              including Canada and Alaska, the continental U.S., Mexico, and the              Caribbean islands.  Investigators from each region will be invited              to participate (total of ca.  30 people).  Objectives are to                    evaluate our current understanding and to chart future research                 needs in four topic areas:  1)  systematics and biodiversity; 2)                biogeography 3) ecosystem processes; and 4) management                          implications.  The final product of the workshop will be a peer-                reviewed volume containing final position papers in each topic area             and short contributions based on poster presentations.  This volume             will be a state-of-the-art resource for research, teaching and                  application.",
