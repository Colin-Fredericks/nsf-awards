The major items requested  in this project include:  - A universal test/demonstration frame, together with its  attachments. This is intended for experiments in vector statics  and strength of materials. Students are able to work on this  frame on their own as part of laboratory experience.  - A reduced-scale model loading frame, including loading  electo-mechanical actuators and data sensing devices, i.e.,  load cells, strain gauges and dial gauges. With the acquisition  of these loading frames students are able to build models and  test them in the laboratory, and thus appreciate structural  system performance.  - Computer software required for the design courses.  Student performance in the courses that are affected by the  facility is monitored and documented. In addition, performance  in other areas of study are monitored, since some of the  courses affected by the facility (vector statics and strength  of materials) are pre-requisites in other areas of the civil  engineering undergraduate program.  ***",
