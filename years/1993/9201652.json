 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop an end-user oriented tool for                         constructing scientific databases. The purpose of the tool is to                radically reduce the time and expense of designing, implementing                and maintaining complex scientific databases by generating database             and user-interface software automatically from declarative, easily              understood high-level specifications. Specifically, the tool will               generate SYBASE databases with X-Window interfaces written in C++               code.  The tool will be developed in two stages: an initial kernel              and an advanced stage. The kernel will support the development and              maintenance of database designs and the automatic generation of                 implementations from them. This phase will focus on automating the              development of a generic type of database application with a number             of features specifically oriented towards scientific needs,                     including the ability to annotate facts with references or                      authorities, facilities for handling synonyms and technical                     thesauri, and self-documenting data models.  The kernel will be                 adapted and generalized from software developed previously by the               authors of this proposal for scientific database applications,                  including a prototype application generator of the type proposed.               In the second phase we will use the kernel as a framework in which              to investigate more advanced problems, specifically, how to expand              the scope of the applications which can easily be generated using               the tool.  In this phase we will identify specific classes of                   functionality not currently supported and develop extensions to                 support them. We expect that these extensions will involve the                  incorporation of restricted languages for specifying fragments of               functionality, such as rules for constructing names or default                  values.  Finally we will attempt to circulate the tool among                    those segments of the biological community involved in database                 development, and incorporate their feedback into the design.",
