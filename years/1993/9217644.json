 "awd_abstract_narration": "The adsorption of macromolecules at interfaces of materials                     plays a key role in many of today's critical technologies.                      Many advanced materials rely heavily on the effects of polymer                  adsorption.  For example. impact resistant polymer blends for                   automotive applications and multilayer film laminates for                       \"smart\" barriers and imaging technologies enjoy dramatically                    improved performance and/or processibility when the                             interfacial regions are modified by polymer adsorption.                         Materials technologies relying on colloidal suspensions (e.g.                   coating processes and \"slip-casting\" for ceramics manufacture)                  utilize polymer adsorption for crucial improvement in                           suspensions properties.  Polymer adsorption also plays a key                    role in biomedicine.  For example, the adsorption of blood                      proteins is a key issue in developing protheses, blood-                         contacting devices and drug-delivery systems.  In the                           separations field, adsorption chromatography, which relies on                   competitive adsorption, is the most effective means of                          separating subtly different macromolecules.                                                                                                                     The dynamic and nonequilibrium aspects of polymer adsorption                    are largely unexplored.  The principal goal of this work is to                  study these aspects in model materials (linear homopolymers                     and diblock copolymers on dielectric and metal surfaces) using                  a quartz microbalance, ESR, and fluorescence spectroscopies                     and pattern photobleacing.  These methods will probe                            elementary dynamic phenomenal in adsorbed layers and will                       clarify the mechanisms of adsorption.  The results will                         provide a basis for controlling adsorption processes crucial                    in application.  The project involves close collaboration                       between the Department of Chemical Engineering and Chemistry                    at Columbia University.",
