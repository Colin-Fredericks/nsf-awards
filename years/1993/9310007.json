Legal professionals  and legal interpretations of scientific theories about human  behavior played a key role in the shaping of Argentine history and  society.  Although Argentina was a post-colonial nation at this  time, it remained part of Europe's \"informal empire.\"  Thus,  Argentina's modernizing processes, as was true of much of Latin  America, were greatly influenced by and intertwined with European  models.  The study focuses on Argentina to illuminate the complex  intellectual and cultural relationship that existed between Latin  America and Europe, and the broader international world and history  that legal science shared.  Its interdisciplinary approach will  result in bringing together a variety of published works and and  previously unstudied archival materials on legal science found in  both Argentina and Europe to provide a deeper insight into how the  transnational diffusion of scientific thought influenced lives and  actions.  This research will make an important contribution to our  empirical knowledge and theoretical understanding of transnational  processes in the relationship between law and society.    The investigator will examine three main sources:  the dossiers of  criminal court cases, the archival records of institutions of  detention, and published legal treatises.  The field research will  be conducted in Buenos Aires, London, Paris, Rome and Bologna.  The  investigator will produce a monograph on law and society in  nineteenth century Argentina and a collection of primary texts,  translated and edited, which document legal science in this period.  ***",
