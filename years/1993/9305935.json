 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support research in the design,                          implementation, and analysis of adaptive finite element methods                 for phase transitions and free boundary problems arising in                     material sciences.  Numerical methods for phase transitions will                be studied; the use of highly graded meshes is extremely                        important for phase transitions and free boundary problems which                typically exhibit sharp interfaces as well as very thin                         transition regions.  The solution, or some of its derivatives,                  may exhibit discontinuities or just vary very rapidly within such               layers, leading to global numerical difficulties if the                         singularities are not properly resolved.  Related sharp interface               models exhibiting competition between surface tension and                       destabilizing mechanisms will also be studied, such as stress                   driven instabilities in solid crystals and solidification                       processes.  The design of linearization techniques for strongly                 nonlinear partial differential equations will be studied and                    combined with mesh refinements.  The interaction of convective                  fluid with free boundaries, for example that corresponding to                   solid coexisting with its melt and interfaces of multiphase                     fluids, will be analyzed numerically.  Finally, mixed methods for               constrained problems will be studied, with special emphasis on                  the Stokes flow and related free boundary problems as well as on                free boundary problems for plates over obstacles.                                    This project is concerned with the design and implementation               of adaptive mesh refinements for nonlinear partial differential                 equations arising in thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, and                        elasticity.  The use of highly graded meshes is important for                   many of these problems, which typically exhibit sharp interfaces                as well as very thin transition regions.  The increasing interest               in such problems stems not only from their mathematical features                but also their applications to phase transitions in material                    sciences, flame propagation, combustion theory, and crystal                     growth.",
