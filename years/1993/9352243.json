 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics Department at SUNY College of Agriculture and                       Technology at Cobleskill is establishing a computer                             laboratory/classroom for regular class scheduling of all                        precalculus and calculus classes. This classroom is allowing                    students to learn mathematics using a \"hands-on\" approach.                      The Harvard Calculus Consortium Project materials are being                     used to teach Calculus I and II at Cobleskill.  Selected                        exercises from the Harvard materials are also supplementing the                 precalculus classes while other precalculus lessons are being                   written or modified from other projects. The faculty are                        attempting to modernize all of their course outlines by using                   the types of presentations and exercises given in the Harvard                   materials. While no specific technology is required for these                   materials, this project is creating a computer                                  laboratory/classroom that includes the CAS software Derive.                     Such software allows the student to do numerical problems,                      graphs, and closed-form algebra and calculus very efficiently.                  Thus, the students are learning by doing mathematics throughout                 the class instead of just watching the teacher. In addition,                    the computers are available for in-class and out-of-class                       laboratory projects. These projects are designed to present                     \"real\" mathematical situations.",
