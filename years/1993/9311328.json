 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311328  Sprague  The literature on mentoring relationships largely concentrates on  management and the development of leaders for business.  This is  rather surprising since higher education, particularly graduate  study, bases itself on the mentor model.  Available evidence  indicates that mentors have considerable influence over the  developing careers of students.  There is some anecdotal and  descriptive information but almost no quantitative data on the  influence of professors-mentors on the development of scientific  values and ethics in students.  There is no literature about the  impacts of gender, race and nationality in these relationships.   This project proposes to begin to gather information and develop  methods to investigate these matters from the standpoint of values  and ethics in science.  This first phase involves a pilot study and  interviews of a sample of faculty-student pairs to obtain  information on what both mentors and students consider important in  the mentoring relationship with respect to values.  Both formal  mentors, those designated by the university, and informal mentors,  designated by the student, will be interviewed in each of seven  departments:  biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences,  economics, physics, and psychology.  Results from this study will  provide more qualitative information about the characteristics of  mentor relationships.  The data base will make it possible to  develop a comprehensive list of areas of values influenced by  mentors, and begin to construct a psychometrically sound  questionnaire which could be administered to a larger sample.  ***",
