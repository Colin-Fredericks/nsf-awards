 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing atmospheric CO2 may have profound effects on                         ecosystem carbon dynamics that could feed back to                               mitigate or exacerbate climate change.  Through some                            studies have examined the effects of elevated CO2 on                            whole system carbon balance, few, if any, have examined                         its effects on soil respiration and soil carbon                                 storage; these ecosystem processes will likely control                          whole-system feedbacks to climate change.  Furthermore,                         it is important to understand how elevated CO2 affects                          the oxidation of different pools of soil carbon                                 (relatively recent photosynthate, litter, and old soil                          organic matter), because if these pools respond                                 differently, whole-system carbon storage and carbon                             allocation could be dramatically altered.                                                                                                                       In this proposal, the student request funding to                                examine the effects of elevated CO2 on the importance                           of rhizodeposits (carbon deposited belowground by plant                         roots), a single plant litter cohort, and remaining                             soil organic matter, in contributing to soil                                    respiration in an annual grassland ecosystem.  He will                          also investigate the effect of elevated CO2 on carbon                           storage in soil organic matter pools with longer                                turnover times.  The proposed research offers a novel                           method of partitioning soil respiration into                                    contributions of roots and microorganisms using a                               stable carbon isotope tracer, will contribute to a                              mechanistic understanding of the effects of elevated                            CO2 on soil carbon cycling, and will help refine his                            predictions of biological feedbacks to global climate                           change.",
