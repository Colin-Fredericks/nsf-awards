 "awd_abstract_narration": "An experimental and theoretical study is proposed for low                       temperature plasmas that contain particulates.  A plasma is an                  ionized gas, and in this work we will concentrate on weakly-                    ionized plasmas of the kind that are used widely in industry for                manufacturing semiconductors, optical materials, and magnetic                   media.  In a plasma, particulates (i.e. micron-size dust                        particles) become electrically charged.  They also may grow in                  size by collecting sputtered atoms in the plasma.  Particulates                 are a costly problem industrial uses of plasma processing                       because they can fall to a substrate and contaminate it.   This                 is the motivation for this work.  Experiments will be carried                   out to observe the time and density dependence of electrical                    charging of dust grains.  These measurements will employ                        optical detection of grains in parallel-plate radio-frequency                   plasmas, and the results will be used to test theories of                       particulate charging in plasmas. Theoretical modeling will be                   performed to simulate the trapping of ions by charged grains.                   Negatively charged grains can trap positive ions in confined                    orbits, and this cause a reduction in the net electric forces that              the charged grains experience.  This modeling will employ                       numerical simulations of the motion of ions, including                          collisions with neutral atoms as well as the electric force                     created by charged grains.",
