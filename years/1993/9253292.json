 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Timothy O'Sullivan, a chemistry professor at the                            University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth campus, has designed                     the Buzzards Bay Rim Project. This multi-year effort will                       train a science teacher leader in every elementary school in                    the region surrounding Buzzards Bay in southeastern                             Massachusetts (approximately 100 schools in nine school                         districts), as well as many principals and school district                      administrators. The region has a high proportion of minority                    students and recent Portugese immigrants, and a level of                        education that trails behind the rest of the state. These                       teachers will receive more than 50 hours of training on                         exemplary hands on curriculum, as well as two summer                            institutes devoted to inquiry based pedagogy and assessment.                    This cadre of teacher leaders would train teachers in their                     schools in the use of hands on inquiry based curriculum, and                    would interact as agents for systemic change in each of                         their host districts. Each district will form a leadership                      team consisting of leader teachers, principals and district                     administrators, and will develop a plan for reform of their                     science instruction. Pre-service teachers at U Mass                             Dartmouth will be assigned to these science leaders as                          mentees. Scientists from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute                     and Lloyd Environmental Center will act as science content                      resources. Massachusetts has recently received a State                          Systemic Initiative award from NSF, and this project will                       coordinate its activities with the State Department of                          Education. The New Bedford School district will participate                     in both projects, and will provide a meeting ground for                         integrating the efforts.                                                                                                                                        The Buzzards Bay Rim Project is a model collaboration among                     universities, informal science centers, and local school                        districts. This effort has significant potential to                             establish outstanding science instruction in elementary                         schools throughout the region. Interactions with the                            Massachusetts State Systemic Initiative Project PALMS will                      allow this approach to be duplicated throughout the state.                                                                                                      Cost sharing represents 83% of the NSF contribution.",
