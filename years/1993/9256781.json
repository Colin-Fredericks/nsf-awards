 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of the National Science Foundation                 Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to increase the numbers of             talented U.S. undergraduates enrolling in doctoral programs in                  critical and emerging areas of science and engineering.  Proposals              were solicited from institutions whose existing facilities and                  staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.                   programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to                      contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across             all geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.                  Graduate Research Traineeship awards are packages of student                    support.  The colleges and universities that receive the awards are             responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees,               and administration of traineeships.                                                  Stanford University plans to increase the number of U.S. Ph.D.             statisticians through a \"Tandem Traineeship\" program.  The                      objective of the program will be to produce students with the                   skills and desire to (a) conduct cross-disciplinary research in                 science and engineering and (b) foster undergraduate education in               the mathematical sciences, particularly probability and statistics,             from a broad, interdisciplinary perspective.  In order to create a              structure in which the cross-disciplinary idea is nurtured,                     students will be encouraged to follow their interests and those of              their chosen faculty members in at least two departments.  In order             to attract a broad base of qualified U.S. applicants, particularly              women, minorities and students with disabilities, current mentoring             and recruitment efforts will be expanded.",
