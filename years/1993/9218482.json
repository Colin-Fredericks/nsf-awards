 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218482  Smithson         This project involves a pilot seismic profile designed to  improve understanding of processes of continental growth associated  with terrane accretion in the Coast orogen of southeast Alaska and  British Columbia.  The seismic data will provide constraints  pertaining to models for the role of thick-skinned thrusting,  metamorphism and magmatism in the formation of continental  lithosphere.  They will also constrain models on how subduction and  translation were accommodated during a major shift in relative  plate motions from head-on (mid Cretaceous) to transcurrent  (Eocene), and how this rearrangement affected crustal development.   The seismic results will guide design of subsequent research  proposals on these problems.         The seismic profiling will use an acoustic source array  deployed from a marine research ship that crosses the Coast orogen  along a 130 km long fjord, and densely spaced (3-5 km) 3-component  seismic recorders placed along the shore to record offsets from 0  to 200 km.  The ship will also deploy a 4 km long hydrophone  streamer for simultaneous MCS (multi-channel seismic) profiling.   This unique experiment combines proven marine seismic techniques  with the new capability of the seismic recorders to determine mid  to lower crustal structure and physical properties of an area of  known continental accretion.  ***",
