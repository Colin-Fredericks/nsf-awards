 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311004  Shaffer    Explanations for species differences in color patterns have usually invoked  variation in perceptual systems, such as female preferences.  Because  conspicuousness of color depends upon context, properties of the environment  should also affect the evolution of color patterns.  Through observational and  experimental studies, Ms. Karen Marchetti has shown that differences in color  patterns among warbler species of the genus Phylloscopus can be predicted from  environmental and behavioral features that affect signal transmission.  Her  studies were conducted at one locality in the breeding season, and concentrated on  mechanisms of sexual selection (female choice and male-male competition).  Now  she will extend the study to encompass the non-breeding season and geographical  variation.  First, she will experimentally manipulate plumage patterns of one  species, which maintains individual territories through the winter, in order to  examine potential selective forces (such as predation) that could balance identified  selective forces in the breeding season.  Second, she will study a new locality in  the breeding season, measuring the extent to which geographical variation in  coloration (within species) is associated with geographic variation in habitat.   Third, she will examine habitat associations and display movements in other  groups of birds to determine the extent to which factors influencing the evolution  of coloration in Phylloscopus can be generalized.    This doctoral-dissertation research will contribute to a number of important areas  in evolutionary and behavioral biology.  It will shed light on the conditions that  lead to sameness or difference in appearance between males and females, on the  mechanisms of sexual selection, and on the importance of the non-breeding season  in affecting the evolution of displays and plumage patterns.",
