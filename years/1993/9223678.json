 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific inference, the process of going from particular                      instances to general laws, has been a matter of philosophical                   concern since the time of Aristotle.  Not until Thomas Bayes                    (1763), however, was there any explicit method presented to use                 probability theory to justify the inference from particulars to                 general laws.  The entire family of Bayesian scientific                         methodologies formulates scientific inference in terms of the                   concept of epistemic probability, considers the prior probability               of scientific hypothesis to be a meaningful concept, and makes use              of Bayes's theorem for evaluating posterior probabilities.  A                   version of Bayesianism proposed by Professor Shimony in 1970,                   called \"tempered personalism,\" recommends that personal probability             evaluations be \"tempered\" by openmindedness towards all seriously               proposed hypotheses in an investigation.  Among the virtues of                  tempered personalism is the possibility of arriving at a non-                   negligible posterior probability for a strong scientific                        generalization.  There are, however, some weaknesses in tempered                personalism which require modifications:  notably, a difficulty in              justifying the axioms of probability, the vagueness of \"seriously               proposed,\" and uncertainty regarding the evaluation of the \"catch-              all\" hypothesis.  Under this grant, Professor Shimony, working with             two graduate students, is amplifying and refining his original                  positions to take account of these difficulties.  He expects to                 remove the first difficulty by a procedure of \"tempering without                tempering.\"  He believes the second and third difficulties are                  ameliorated by properly combining analytic propositions of                      probability with a posteriori principles.  He and his students are              undertaking a number of scientific case studies for the purpose                 both of illustrating the power of this refined methodology and for              heuristics in formulating the a posteriori principles in inductive              inference.",
