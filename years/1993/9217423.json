 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks support to quantify and codify measurements of               structural, igneous, and metamorphic/alteration features observed               in core materials and logs of Ocean Drilling Program Hole 504B.  At             just over 2 kilometers sub-seafloor depth, 504B is the deepest                  borehole in ocean crust, and the only one that samples the pillow               basalt/sheeted dike transition.   This borehole has been                        successfully deepened through six (6) DSDP and ODP legs.  PI began              the task of detailed description of structural and petrologic                   features on the most recent, Leg 140.  His initial work shows that              significant trends and/or cycles in such features as vein abundance             and secondary minerals may exist.  PI now wishes to extend this                 work through examination and description of core materials from the             previous five (5) drilling legs.  The goals of this research are to             provide a standard and more detailed descriptive log of this                    important ocean crustal reference section, and to determine what                overall trends and cycles in structural and petrologic features                 exist down hole.  This information, in turn, will provide insights              to processes of ocean crust formation, as well as processes of                  secondary hydrothermal alteration of ocean crust.",
