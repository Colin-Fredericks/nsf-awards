 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is efficient synthetic methodology                   based on the use of novel carbanions mainly produced by                         reduction of either small-ring oxygen heterocycles or of                        functionalized molecules containing the phenylthio group.  A                    major emphasis is the production and use of lithioalkenes, but                  oxygenated organolithiums will also be used.  Most of the                       methods involve the synthesis or modification of ring compounds                 with an emphasis being on ring compounds found in natural                       products.  A highly novel investigation involves the                            copolymerization of butadiene and isoprene to a living polymer.                 %%%                                                                             With this award, the Synthetic Organic Program is supporting                    the research of Dr. Theodore Cohen of the Department of                         Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh.  Professor Cohen                     will focus his work on the use of novel carbanions as                           intermediates in organic synthesis, mainly for the preparation                  or modification of cyclic compounds.",
