 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will focus on martingales and related classes                of stochastic processes and their applications, including                       applications to other parts of mathematics.  Concrete problems                  will be studied whose solutions will be applicable in statistical               and mathematical analysis.  At the same time, general methods                   will be sought that may help to solve some of the concrete                      problems that will arise in the study of stochastic integrals,                  singular integral operators, and the geometry of Banach                         spaces.                                                                              The goal of the proposed research is to solve specific                     problems in mathematical and statistical analysis, and to develop               general methods that will aid in the solution of similar                        problems, not yet foreseen, that will arise in the future.  The                 work supported by previous grants has led to new mathematical                   tools that have applications in industry, science, and                          technology. In all likelihood, the proposed research will yield                 more new tools as well as sharpen old ones.",
