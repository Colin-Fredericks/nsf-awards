 "awd_abstract_narration": "Typical engineering courses emphasize closed-ended examples and                 problems.  While these problems aid in the development of                       convergent thinking skills, they usually do not provide                         practice for improving the divergent thinking patterns                          essential for the solution of industrial and research problems.                 This proposal presents a plan for enhancing the problem-solving                 and synthesis skills of first-year engineering students to                      develop a mind-set lasting throughout their college careers and                 professional lives.  This enhancement will be achieved through                  an innovative, required first-year course. In a first-year                      class of over 1,000 students, it is virtually impossible to                     achieve the ideal one-on-one interaction required to develop                    divergent thinking skills.  In the proposed first-year course                   interactive computer modules and open-ended problems will be                    used in conjunction with lectures and exercises that present a                  robust problem solving heuristic.  The computer modules will                    allow the students to make decisions in gray areas at branch                    points in decision trees, to troubleshoot, and to make                          decisions on what data they need to access from the computer.                   Our previous work on writing interactive modules has resulted                   in our developing strategies that individualize the                             instruction. The students will then work in groups to apply                     these concepts to solve open-ended design problems, written at                  such a level that first-year students will be able to generate                  innovative solutions.  These group interactions, requiring a                    written report, will provide a framework to enhance the                         students' interpersonal and communications skills.  The                         proposed project will initially have the potential to influence                 over 1,000 first-year engineering students.  Further, the                       modules and material developed will then be distributed to                      other engineering colleges across the nation.",
