Support is provided by the   Chemistry Division. One major theme of the research is access   in nanoporous layered materials. Specific elements of the   research will be control of pore size, structural modification   of the layers by pillaring intercalants, and a study of   structural and dynamical factors which govern access in micro-   and mesoporous systems.  A full complement of synthetic,   characterization and theoretical approaches will be employed.   Typical systems which will be studied are smectite clays,   layered double hydroxides and nanoporous metal chalcogenides.  A second major theme is the design, synthesis and   characterization of layered silicate and silicic acid   heterostructures. Layered silicates will be synthesized in   which two ions of different solvation energies are segregated   into regularly alternating galleries by spontaneous   self-assembly. These ordered heterostructures containing   hydrophobic alkyl onium ions and hydrophilic inorganic cations   will be well suited for acid catalysis and guest-host   chemistry. Another class of materials which will be synthesized   and characterized are layered silicic acid derivatives formed   by templated intragallery hydrolysis-condensation reactions of   chiral silicates in the presence of liquid amines. The nature   of the amine will determine the pore structure and size.  These chiral materials will be suitable as catalysts for   asymmetric synthesis and for separation of optical isomers.  %%%  Nanoporous layered materials are of high technological interest   in catalysis and separations and are potentially important in   electronic, optical and structural applications.   ***",
