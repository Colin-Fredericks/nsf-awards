 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project staff from the DNA Learning Center, Cold Spring                         Harbor Laboratory, NY plan to bring instruction in human and                    molecular genetics to 216 precollege advanced biology                           teachers in rural/non-urban areas of the western half of the                    U.S. and the upper Midwest regions.  Three 5-day DNA Science                    institutes (24 participants each) are to be held with 3                         follow-up workshops.  In addition, leadership and advanced                      training will be provided for a cadre of 72 \"Human and                          Molecular Genetics Resource Teachers\" throughout the United                     States who have already implemented model units on molecular                    genetics and have proven networking abilities.  This                            training will consist of a 27 day leadership institute at                       Cold Spring Harbor and three 3-day regional follow-up                           conferences associated with regional NABT or NSTA meetings.                     The proposal contains specific follow-up and evaluation                         programs, and includes provisions for participation by                          minority faculty.                                                                                                                                               This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                    it will select participants regionally for discipline-                          focused summer institutes utilizing new approaches and                          content (DNA and molecular genetics) to enhance the                             participants' current leadership component for teachers with                    more advanced backgrounds in the field.
