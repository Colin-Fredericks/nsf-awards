 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312042  Stephens, L    Rural economies in developing nations are fundamentally altered by a variety of  world and local events such as variation in demand for raw commodities or land  reforms.  This project will evaluate the impact of the recent free trade agreement  between the US and Mexico and ejido restructuring on gender and family  relations in three sectors: rural ejido communities, non-ejido rural subsistence  communities, and in the urban informal sector.  Research will focus on regional  factors such a changing employment availability, land prices and family  dynamics in six sites.  The investigator predicts that economic restructuring in  Mexico will have different effects on the rural and urban poor in relation to  region, gender, age, and ethnicity.  The specific topics to be explored in local  reserach sites include the gendered division of labor, household, marital and  family relationships, migration patterns, political mobilization, and participation in  community cultural institutions.  Research will be eventually be extended to a  total of six sites in Oaxaca and Nayarit.  This Research Planning Grant for  Women Scientists requests funding for the first 18 months of a five year project  to facilitate a pilot study in the state of Oaxaca and to allow the principle  investigator time to gather background data to write a three-year NSF proposal  to complete the full project.    Specific planning activities include: (1) spending part of the 1993-94 summer  and academic year in Oaxaca, Mexico to institute a pilot study in three  communities; (2) spending one month during the 1994-95 academic year at the  Center for US-Mexican Studies in San Diego, California using the data base on  ejido household to frame questions and collect background data for the states  of Oaxaca and Nayarit; (3) spending part of the investigator's sabbatical year,  1994-95 writing a multi-year NSF proposal to fund the remaining three years of  this project; and (4) reading relevant materials available in Me xico and  communication with scholars involved in research on agrarian restructuring in  Mexico during the 18 month planning period.   ***",
