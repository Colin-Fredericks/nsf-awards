 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309669  Zhang       This research concerns development of diamond growth  techniques in which the oxyacetylene combustion synthesis method  is employed.  The project involves design and construction of a  diamond growth apparatus consisting of an oxyacetylene welding  torch, fitted with a brazing or cutting nozzle, two mass flow  controllers and a mass flow programmer, etc., and growth of diamond  films on a variety of cutting tool materials.  The ultimate goal  is to apply the research findings to an industrial situation,  namely to produce viable, inexpensive techniques of diamond coating  on various cutting tools for manufacturing applications.       Currently, the mechanisms for nucleation of the diamond phase  and for adherent bonding of diamond film to the substrate are not  will understood, making the application of this technology very  limited.  The research will investigate the nucleation mechanisms  of diamond phase involved in the diamond growth processes.  The  investigation will include pretreatment of substrate surfaces in  various conditions, detection of dangling bond densities on the  pre-treated substrate using the electron paramagnetic resonance  (EPR) technique, and analysis of the precursor gas within and  beyond stagnation zone of the acetylene flame using the residual  gas analysis technique.  Nucleation mechanisms of diamond phase  will be researched by incorporating studies of chemical species of  precursor gas and dangling bond densities  of the substrate.   Parametric studies will be towards enhancing nucleation density of  diamond phase and improving quality of diamond films.  The  researcher will seek to develop a fundamental understanding   of  these mechanisms which will facilitate the application of  oxyacetylene combustion synthesis of diamond films to industrial  applications.",
