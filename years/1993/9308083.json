 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research two new general purpose algorithms for                    multidisciplinary design optimization will be fully developed and               implemented in application to electronic package optimization.  In              one algorithm second order system sensitivities will be generated               using local second order design sensitivities generated                         concurrently during subsystem optimizations.  The concurrent                    subsystem optimizations and local sensitivity calculations will be              implemented in parallel to achieve greater efficiencies.  The                   algorithm provides a computationally inexpensive procedure for                  quantifying subsystem interactions as compared to previous                      algorithm proposals.  The second algorithm will use neural networks             to build approximations of the system design space.  The use of                 neural networks to represent the design space moves the                         multidisciplinary design optimization strategy away from the point              design techniques used in previous algorithm proposals.  The neural             network will be trained using data that is accumulated during                   concurrent subspace optimizations.  The algorithms will be                      developed as general purpose design optimization tools for                      application to a variety of complex coupled multidisiplinary                    systems.                                                                             Electronic packaging design is an area where immediate                     benefits can be realized through the application of                             multidisciplinary design optimization.  In multidisciplinary design             optimization the complex couplings between subsystems are formally              quantified and exploited in a concurrent design process.                             //",
