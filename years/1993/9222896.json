 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cells of the nervous system go through many changes as the                  develop, and many factors control their development.  Individual                cells are born in one region but must then migrate to another                   region where development continues.  As cells develop, they extend              processes or axons to make connections with other cells of the                  nervous system.  A cell also receives axonal connections from other             neurons.  It has been suggested that projections from neurons in                the eye influence the development of cells with which they connect              in visual centers in the brain such as the tectum.  The goal of                 this project is to determine how cell-cell interactions influence               the birth, migration, and maturation of individual cells.                       Individual cells in the optic tectum will be labeled with                       fluorescent dyes, and the cells will be followed with video                     microscopy as they proceed through development.  Subsequently, the              environment of the tectal cells will be manipulated by unilateral               enucleation.  In these altered embryos, the tectal cells will not               receive the normal contacts from the retina.  Using the normal data             as a reference, labeled cells in the tectum will be analyzed to                 determine precisely the aspects of development that are affected by             interactions with projections from the eye.  The aim of this                    research is to provide an integrated description in real time                   earliest dynamic processes involved in the development of the                   visual system.***//",
