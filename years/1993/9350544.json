 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Society of Automotive Engineers is planning the                             feasibility for the development of three intensive units for                    grades six through eight about which the entire curriculum                      could be integrated for a few weeks.  The units would take                      the form of automotive engineering design experiences:                          exploring automotive systems, flight technology and ground                      transportation.  The materials would be targeted to specific                    grade levels and engage multiple community resources in                         dynamic ways.  The planning period is to form collaborations                    with the other major national curriculum groups, and                            educational researchers and middle school personnel and to                      develop the prototype of the technological challenges which                     form the core of the integrated learning experience.  Based                     on their experience with The World in Motion, the project                       will reach about 10% of the student body nationally through                     interactions with engineers in corporations and                                 universities.  The goals of the project also include the                        long term collaboration of businesses, professional                             societies and universities, the involvement of individual                       engineers with the education of middle school students, and                     the encouragement of a greater diversity of students to                         consider engineering as a career.  The planning period is to                    establish a program development office, to hold a planning                      conference to establish the collaborations, to develop and                      obtain reaction to a prototype and to prepare a proposal for                    developing the curriculum units.",
