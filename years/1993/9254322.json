 "awd_abstract_narration": "Differential geometry of curves and surfaces has an important                   role in solidifying the standard courses in beginning calculus                  and linear algebra.  The topic provides the tools for                           visualization of geometric phenomena and for applications to                    physics, engineering, computer science, and other areas of                      mathematics.  The subject is particularly well-suited to                        interactive computer graphics.  In this project, a complete set                 of transportable, interactive computer graphics laboratory                      modules is being developed.  The materials can be used to                       supplement standard courses in calculus and linear algebra, or                  to supplement a standard textbook in elementary differential                    geometry.  The materials can also provide the foundation on                     which to build a laboratory intensive differential geometry                     course.  Innovations include the use of new \"hypertext\" tools                   for interaction and response, and the use of computer graphics                  to enhance the visualization experience.  Each module presents                  a single topic or related topics, illustrated by examples that                  can be modified by students in response to questions and                        suggestions.  The modules are written in a demonstration-                       investigative mode, well suited for cooperative and                             collaborative activities.  The target student audience includes                 students considering concentrations in mathematics, physics,                    engineering, and computer science.",
