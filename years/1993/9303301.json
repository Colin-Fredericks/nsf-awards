 "awd_abstract_narration": "During this project the relative gene order of a sipunculan                will be analyzed, the entire sequence of cytochrome oxidase (CO)                subunits I - III for this species will be derived, and same will be             done for partial CO I - III sequences.  These data will permit the              creation of a molecular phylogeny of the Sipuncula relative to                  other closely related eucoelomate protostome phyla for which                    sequence data are presently available.  Separate phylogenies will               be derived based on relative gene order and CO I - III sequence                 data, and those will be checked for congruence as a test of the two             methods.  Partial sequence data from at least five other sipunculan             species will be analyzed with the original sequence data in order               to create a phylogeny of the six described families of the phylum.              Using this information it will be possible to produce an                        independent test of a phylogenetic analysis based solely on                     morphology.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The Sipuncula is a widely distributed group that is little known                and poorly understood genetically and phylogenetically.  Though not             a large phylum, this limited diversity hasn't facilitated                       understanding of either the evolution of the group itself or the                relationship of the phylum to metazoan evolution based upon                     phenotypic (morphological and ontogenetic) characters.  The gene                order and sequence data that will result from this study will be                essential for characterizing fine- and coarse-grained evolution of              the mitochondrial genome within the entire group.  Such information             will reveal answers about phylogeny within the Sipuncula and                    affinities with the Metazoa, and will also provide baseline genetic             information for further studies concerning the biogeography of                  widespread species and population variation of ocean-dispersed                  larval organisms.  All of the foregoing is important because marine             species are under-represented in studies of systematics and                     biodiversity.",
