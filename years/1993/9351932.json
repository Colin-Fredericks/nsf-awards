 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of an ongoing College of Engineering Curriculum-                        Laboratory Revitalization Program, the Chemical & Materials                     Engineering Department is developing an innovative Unit                         Operations Lab consisting of nine new experimental stations and                 nine new corresponding computer simulation programs and data                    acquisition systems. Together with a modular control lab and                    analytical instrumentation, this forms a new laboratory complex                 for a flexible, modular approach to chemical processing at the                  systems level. It features industrial caliber equipment                         compatible with laboratory scale operations. The intent is to                   provide the undergraduate student with an education involving                   equipment, program simulators, data acquisition systems, and a                  mode of conduct representative of professional employment                       situations, consistent with a wide diversity of the chemical                    industry. The planning and implementation of this effort is                     being closely coordinated with an industry advisory group.This                  project involves the procurement of three items, i.e., heat                     exchanger, gas absorption, and chemical reactor units for the                   Unit Operations Lab. These constitute the threshold core from                   which  the comprehensive curriculum-laboratory structure                        evolves.",
