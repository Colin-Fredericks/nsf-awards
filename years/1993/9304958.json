 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304958  Swalla    The proposed experiments investigate the role of a novel 58 kD  protein (p58) in ascidian larval tail muscle differentiation.   Ascidian embryos are used as a model system to study cell  autonomous differentiation because embryonic cells which inherit  the myoplasm, a localized region of the egg, will become larval  muscle cells in isolation.  The experiments to be performed will  test the hypothesis that p58 is involved in larval tail muscle  determination.  P58 is synthesized early in oogenesis, then is  concentrated in the egg myoplasm during vitellogenesis, and later  is abundant in larval tail muscle cells.  I have sequenced a clone  isolated by screening an expression library with NN18, an antibody  which recognizes p58 on western blots.  This clone encodes a novel  protein related to transducin, the Drosophila Enhancer of split   E(spl)  message m9/10, and human nuclear proteins.  E(spl) is a  member of the Notch group of genes, which have been shown by  mutational analysis to function in cell fate decisions through  interactions with Notch, an EGF-like transmembrane protein.  I  propose to use the ascidian embryo as a model system to study the  mode of action of these unique genes.  The PI will first examine  the temporal and spatial expression of the p58 gene during  embryogenesis by northern and in situ hybridization.  Possible  interaction(s) of p58 with egg cytoskeletal components will be  investigated by double immunofluorescent labelling followed by  confocal microscopy, and also by ultrastructural  immunolocalization.  The role of p58 during embryogenesis will be  examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments.  P58  function in the embryo will be inhibited by microinjecting  antibodies into the egg and documenting the effect on development  and larval tail muscle formation.  The effect of expressing the  gene in cells that do not normally express it will be analyzed by  microinjection of cDNA clones or purified protein into the embryo.   In most  ascidian species, the egg develops into a tadpole larva  with a distinct head and a tail containing bands of striated muscle  cells, but in anural (tailless) embryos, there are no muscle cells  in the \"larval\" stage.  Anural (tailless) ascidians lack both  localization of p58 in their egg myoplasm and larval tail muscle  cells, so that expression of the p58 gene will be examined in  anural embryos to explore how the egg cytoskeletal may be organized  differently in these species.  These experiments will test the  possibility that p58 may have a role in autonomous muscle cell  determination in ascidians.  ***",
