The Pakistani organizer is Dr. Atta ur Rahman, director of the H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry at the University of Karachi.  The symposium and a Pakistan U.S. Workshop will deal with frontier areas of natural product chemistry including stereoselective synthesis, modern spectroscopic techniques for structure elucidation, bioactive natural products and bioorganic chemistry.  The program will consist of plenary lectures, session lectures and poster presentations.  The sessions will be divided into four parallel sessions covering: synthetic approaches to natural products, bioactive natural products, structural studies on natural products, and bioorganic chemistry.  Scope:  This is the first IUPAC organized symposium to be held in Pakistan.  The H.E.J. Research Institute of Chemistry has organized several past symposia on natural product chemistry, with participation by eminent scientists from around the world, and with high quality publications resulting from these meetings.  The project will be beneficial to U.S. and to Pakistan scientists but also to participants from countries in South Asia and the Middle East which are usually represented.  A pre IUPAC symposium will be held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and a post IUPAC will be held in Amman, Jordan.  The project will help many of the scientists in these countries to establish contacts with scientists from the U.S. for fut ure collaboration. ***",
