 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arabidopsis thaliana has recently been developed as a model                host system to study the molecular genetics if plant pathogen                   interactions.  This has allowed us to propose a series of                       definitive genetic experiments to dissect the molecular basis of                recognition and potential signal transduction events involved in                plant disease resistance.  We propose to genetically dissect both               race-specific and systemic acquired disease resistance by                       identifying and characterizing disease susceptible mutants that are             altered in the expression of disease resistance.  The mutants will              be phenotypically and genetically characterized to ascertain how                many loci control the expression of disease resistance in both                  types of resistance.  Our research will then focus on the avrB-                 specific disease susceptible mutants and will employ these mutants              to clone the RPG1 disease resistance locus by the techniques of                 chromosome walking and/or T-DNA tagging.                                        %%%                                                                             The ease with which mutations in Arabidopsis can be isolated,                   genetically mapped, and corresponding wild type loci cloned                     circumvents many disadvantages encountered in the study of other                plant species with more complex genomes and puts us in a unique                 position to clone the RPG1 disease resistance locus which can then              be used to determine if the same resistance locus is present in                 commercially important crop plants.",
