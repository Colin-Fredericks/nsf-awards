 "awd_abstract_narration": "The media is filled today with reference to the global economic                 village, political leaders talk in terms of world                               competitiveness, and Americans fear the loss of productivity and                living standards.  Economists have come to call this process                    convergence, and theory and empirical analysis on post World War                II experience with it have flourished.  It is often forgotten,                  however, that this process of economic convergence has a very                   long history.  It starts in the 19th century following two                      important economic events; the discovery New World resources and                the industrial revolution.  Both of these events created economic               divergence: wage, standard of living and per capita income gaps                 between members of the current OECD industrialized club increased               sharply.  After the 1850's, however, this divergence was followed               by more than a century of convergence when poor countries grew                  faster than rich countries.  What has been observed since the                   1950s, therefore, has been going on since the middle of the last                century.                                                                                                                                                        This process of convergence took place in fits and starts, and                  one major goal of this project is to identify which episodes                    underwent convergence and why.  A second major objective is to                  uncover the forces which caused convergence.  These would include               international labor migrations, international capital flows,                    international trade, skill formation, and technological advance.                War, policy intervention, and other events favoring or                          suppressing factor flows and trade are also likely to have played               a central role in shaping those forces underlying the                           convergence.  A better understanding of these historical forces                 should provide useful insights about the course of future world-                wide economic growth.",
