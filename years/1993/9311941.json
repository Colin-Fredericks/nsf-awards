 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311941  Varanasi    This award will support a fifteen month grant under the NSF-CGP  (Center for Global Partnership) Science Fellowship Program for  Professor Sasidhar Varanasi, Department of Chemical Engineering,  University of Toledo, Ohio.  Professor Varanasi will undertake a  three month cooperative research project with Dr. Norihiko  Minoura, Department of Organic Materials, National Institute of  Materials and Chemical Research (NIMC) in Tsukuba, Japan.  The  research will focus on the control of solute permeability across  membranes made of di/triblock copolyelectrolytes.  This will be  accomplished by fabricating membranes, the permeability of which  to large Brownian solutes can be tuned in a predictable manner,  via changing the pH and/or ionic strength of the solutions  bathing the membrane.  This ability, in turn, should allow one to  make the membrane highly selective in separating two solutes the  sizes of which differ only to a small extent.  Two kinds of  membranes will be perfected to achieve the goal.  First, will be  polyelectrolytes absorbed in the pores of non-selective  microporous membranes.  The second would be ABA type triblock  copolypeptides cast into a film using a solvent.  The performance  characteristics of membranes made by microphase separation will  be compared to those made via grafting copolymers into  microporous membranes to determine which of the methods leads to  reliable and robust membranes with \"tunable\" permeation  properties.          Results of the research have potential for practical applications  in a variety of important fields such as self-regulated release  of pharmaceutics and the synthesis of several biochemicals.  The  National Institute of Materials and Chemical Research is a first-  rate facility that has made considerable progress in polymeric  materials research.  Dr. Minoura is a well-known expert in  membrane science in general and in synthetic polyelectrolyte  membranes in particular.  This specialization coupled with  Professor Va ranasi's expertise in the area should provide an  excellent collaboration that most likely would continue on an  informal basis in the future.",
