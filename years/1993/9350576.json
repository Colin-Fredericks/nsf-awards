It will employ an  investigative approach to a local environmental problem.   Interdependent research groups of students will focus on different  areas of a common problem and cooperate to propose a solution.  The  proposed research will combine field and laboratory components.   The environmental emphasis will allow students to focus on many  disciplines including: life sciences, physical sciences,  statistics, engineering, economics, library, writing, and  presentation skills.  The groups will attend joint meetings once  each week to inform others of their progress, share information,  and offer suggestions,  Students will see how the various  disciplines work together using technology to meet the needs of  society.    Local industry, community, and university professionals will  provide diverse presentations on relevant research activities and  career opportunities.  Local tribes will provide cultural evenings  and speakers to address issues relative to the preservation of  culture, traditional ways, and tribal views of the environment and  science.  Advisory boards composed of parents, tribal leaders,  teachers, and administrators within the cooperating tribes and  school districts will coordinate recruitment of participants.   Summer Science Camp activities will be coordinated with school year  programs established within the larger program.  These include  science clubs, equipment loans, speaker programs, problem-oriented  curriculum development, etc.",
