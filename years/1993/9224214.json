 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to determine the                              effect of local flow conditions on the distribution of                          a stream insect, emphasizing possible constraints on                            settlement from the water current.  Although some                               studies have been done on this subject in marine                                environments, the consequences of hydrodynamic                                  constraints on settlement have not been actively                                studied in freshwater systems.  Transport by water                              currents in streams and rivers (drift) has been the                             object of intense work and debate, but very few studies                         have attempted to determine its significance to the                             individual organism.  This study will be one of the                             first tests of the hypothesis of active drift as a                              foraging decision.  This test will be aided by the                              development of a foraging model in which the organism                           has incomplete information of its environment.  In                              itself the model will be an important addition to a                             field in which models and critical tests are still                              fragmentary.                                                                                                                                                    Black fly larval dispersal in a stream is largely                               analogous to the movements of ballooning spiders or                             lepidopteran larvae (including gypsy moth larvae), two                          groups that have been analyzed from a fluid mechanic                            point of view.  What makes this system particularly                             interesting is the largely unidirectional nature of the                         movement.  This relative simplicity will provide                                important insights that may be applied to the ecology                           of other organisms that are transported by air or water                         currents in some phase of their life cycle.",
