 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Charles Spencer and               Elsa Redmond will conduct three seasons of archaeological survey                and excavation at a site near the present day town of San Martin                Tilcajete (SMT), located in the Oaxaca Valley of Mexico. A final                season with be spent analyzing the materials collected. Preliminary             work indicates that the site consists of 17 mounds organized into               two mound groups and that it was occupied from ca. 700-200 BC. Drs.             Spencer and Redmond will make a detailed map of the site and note               all mounds, stone foundations and other cultural features. Surface              artifacts will be sampled with controlled intensive surface                     collection. In the second season, test excavations will be placed               in both mound and non-mound locations with specific placements                  guided by an assessment of the surface collections. In season three             horizontal excavation will occur on a sample of public buildings as             well as in domestic contexts. On this basis it will be possible to              trace changes in the site over approximately half a millennium.                 Variation in population size and degree of political centralization             will be monitored. Through analysis of material remains it will                 also be possible to determine the relationships between this site               and others in the Oaxaca Valley.                                                                                                                                State level organizations have independently arisen only a few                  times in human history and archaeologists wish to understand the                mechanisms by which this process occurs. The Zaoptec state which                was centered at the site of Monte Alban in Oaxaca and appeared                  during the first millennium BC provides one example. While the                  latter stage of this process is well known through extensive                    excavations at Monte Alban, relatively little is known about the                early part of the process since the relevant layers remain buried               under buildings which have been reconstructed by the Mexican                    government. At the SMT site, such data are readily available. SMT               appears to be a regional subcenter and for this reason will provide             unique insight from what is a provincial perspective.                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons. Many archaeologists             have worked in the Oaxaca Valley and the data Drs. Spencer and                  Redmond collect will fill a major gap. It will also increase our                understanding of the forces which led to the development of state               level societies.",
