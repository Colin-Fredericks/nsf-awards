 "awd_abstract_narration": "The inability to sufficiently characterize the spatial distribution             of hydraulic conductivity (K) is an obstacle to constructing                    reliable predictive models of ground-water flow and pollutant                   transport, to remediating ground-water contamination, and to                    effectively managing and protecting ground-water resources.  In                 glacially derived aquifers, it is common to have low-K facies (e.g.             till or lacustrine clay) juxtaposed with high-K facies (e.g. sand               and gravel outwash).  In the buried-valley aquifers of the western              and central plains of North America, assemblages of permeable                   outwash facies form large and productive regional aquifer systems.              Although the exact geometry of the high-K  and low-K facies can                 only be determined by a prohibitive amount of subsurface                        information, conditional indicator simulation provides a way to                 compute a number of realizations of facies distributions that have              identical spatial covariance structure and that honor available                 data.  Running transport simulations using a large number of these              realizations, and examining the central tendency and variance of                simulated contaminant travel times, or the simulated contaminant                pathways, can give insight into how contaminants will move through              the real system.  However, conditional indicator simulations                    require that an adequate indicator variogram model of the spatial               covariance of the facies assemblage can be defined from field data,             when in fact the field data are often insufficient for this                     purpose.  The objective of the proposed research under the Research             at Undergraduate Institutions Program is to determine variogram                 models from field data at a number of locations in a buried-valley              aquifer system.  Two undergraduate students will be involved in                 field work that will create the basis for their senior research                 projects.  One M.S. student will be involved in the geostatistical              analysis of the data.  The conceptual model of a specific facies                assemblage will be combined with the variogram model to crate a                 quantitative hydrofacies model.  As we begin to catalogue                       quantitative facies models, we will compare them for similarities               and begin to test the hypothesis that one or more archetypal                    quantitative hydrofacies can be developed for general types of                  facies assemblages in buried-valley aquifer systems.",
