 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351887  Quigley  The aim of this project is to develop an undergraduate  astronomical imaging laboratory. This laboratory enables  physics majors during their junior year to acquire the know-  ledge, skills, and experience needed to undertake astronomy  research projects during the following year.  To accomplish this goal, the department is purchasing a CCD   charge-coupled device  camera and controller system, three Sun  SPARCstation computers, and associated peripheral equipment.  The CCD imaging system enables students to carry out both  laboratory imaging experiments and actual star-field imaging  using the department's Celestron-8 telescopes. The Sun  workstation allows students to carry out detailed analysis of  CCD images and NASA satellite telescope spectra of astronomical  objects. IRAF, the powerful astronomy image analysis software  package used by professional astronomers throughout the world,  is the primary tool used for data analysis. The Sun  workstations are networked and connected to Internet so that  data can be routinely retrieved from NASA centers and on-line  astronomy data services. Students also are able to transfer  data to and from observatories and other universities that they  may work at during the summer after their junior year.  This project is significant because it enables undergraduate  physics majors to become actively engaged in astronomy  research. Students also become \"plugged in\" to the modern  astronomical community by becoming users of NASA's  Astrophysical Data System and other astronomy data archives and  services that are available over Internet. It enables Western  to offer a solid Astronomy Concentration within the Physics  B.S. degree, a concentration that gives students a good idea of  what to expect if they go on to graduate school or other  professional work in astronomy.  ***",
