 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to address the question of how intuitive and  concise linear model concepts and techniques can be extended to  nonparametric settings and it is also proposed to develop  nonparametric techniques for model diagnostics that can be used  for dimensionality reduction and to address the question of  adequacy of particular models.  More precisely, it is proposed to  focus on procedures that are counterparts to such commonly used  linear model ideas as regression coefficients, correlation  coefficients, ANOVA decompositions, and principal components.  In  addition, it is proposed to consider nonparametric tools for  model building, identification, and diagnostics including tests  for linearity, partial linearity, additivity, etc. All estimators  to be considered depend on smoothing parameters needed in  estimation of curves and surfaces.  A large part of the research  will address the problem of developing reliable data-based  methods for smoothing parameter selection.  With the advent of computer data bases of unprecedented size and  complexity and with dramatic increase in computer power, it has  become increasingly more desirable and possible to develop  general models, concepts, and procedures that can be used to  study relationships between variables and to construct models  less dependent on specific assumptions. It is proposed to extend  commonly used linear model ideas and techniques to this more  general setting  and to assess the adequacy of models with  simpler structure.",
