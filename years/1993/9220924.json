 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and                    Organometallic Chemistry Program.  Its focus is the kinetics                    and mechanisms of main-group inorganic reactions in aqueous                     solution. Stopped-flow methods (with single wavelength, rapid                   scan and conductivity detection) will be used to obtain kinetic                 data.  The stopped-slow data will be used to obtain rate                        constants, reaction rate laws and stoichiometries.  Reactions                   to be studied include: 1) Selected electron transfer reactions                  between pairs of main-group redox couples, in order to provide                  stringent tests of the applicability of Marcus theory to                        reactions between species of widely differing ionic radii;                      2) electron transfer reactions involving chlorine/dichloride,                   bromine/dibromide, hydroxylammonium/hydroxylamine, and NO/NO-                   as redox couples, where the reaction partners are                               substitution-inert coordination complexes, leading to standard                  redox potentials and effective self-exchange rate constants for                 the main-group couples; 3) dihydrogen transfer from diimide                     (now that methods are available to generate and detect this                     species) with emphasis on reactions with dioxygen, diiodine and                 hydrogen peroxide, as well as with olefins and one-electron                     oxidants; 4) inner-sphere reactions in which sulfite is                         oxidized by tetrachloroaurate(III) and other coordination                       complexes, probing the mechanistic factors that lead to                         formation of the S-S bond in dithionate; 5) the reactions of NO                 with dioxygen and of sulfur trioxide with water, because of                     their relevance to environmental issues.                                        %%%                                                                             Reactions of molecules containing the so-called main-group                      elements, such as nitrogen, sulfur, chlorine and bromine, are                   of great importance in industry and in everyday life, with                      examples including the purification of drinking water and the                   action of chlorine bleach in the home washing machine. In                       addition to providing a better understanding of how many of                     these common reactions occur, the results of this project may                   provide insight into how to avoid detrimental side reactions,                   such as the formation on carcinogens during the chlorination of                 sewage plant effluents.",
