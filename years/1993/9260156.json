 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low cost workstations and increasingly powerful PCs now make it                 feasible for a computer to record experimental data and make                    high-level analyses of the results for many classes of                          neuroscience experiments; the computer should further be able to                determine autonomously when statistically valid results have been               accumulated, recognize and repeat defective or failed                           measurements, appropriately alter experiment parameters and                     protocol, and even recognize unexpected opportunities and adjust                protocol to take advantage of them.  While the best of current                  generation of experiment control software supports on-line                      analysis and decision making, it requires sophisticated                         programming skills to implement these capabilities, and the                     experiment must pause to analyze results and evaluate control                   logic.  This causes a loss of experiment time.  We propose                      research on a Real-Time Expert System Experiment Controller that                will:  1) capture data from a laboratory's present control                      computer; 2) perform sophisticated analyses on incoming results;                3) make experiment control decision of the sort presently made by               the experimenter (basing them on the experimenter's priorities,                 reasoning methods, statistical criteria and rules of thumb, which               are encoded in the expert system's knowledge base as a                          hierarchical set of interdependent hypotheses; 4) either directly               command the present control computer to implement its decisions,                allowing the experimenter to manipulate priorities and high level               control variables to influence the way the controller allocates                 effort; 5) or convey recommendations to the experimenter so he                  may make the ultimate decisions.                                                                                                                                Such a system should improve experiment flow decision by                        increasing the sophistication of analysis on which they are                     based.  The proposed research will evaluate the Controller's                    performance, suggesting design improvements and validating the                  concept of expert system experiment control.  Success will lead                 to improved productivity and cost-effectiveness of neuroscience                 research that is amenable to computer control.",
