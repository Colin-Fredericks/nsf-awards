 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most of the work in the field of logic synthesis has concentrated  on the topics of logic minimization and synthesis for testability.   While both of these issues are of great importance, it seems  natural to go beyond these applications.  This effort aims to  expand the current applications of logic synthesis to include the  domain of synthesis for reduced power dissipation.    The work here is based on the assumption that switching activity,  the number of internal nodes that are charged or discharged when a  new set of inputs is applied to the system, is a strong indicator  of power dissipation in static CMOS structures.  The proposal  builds on some novel results obtained in the synthesis of two level  logic circuits, such that they exhibit, optimal switching  activities.  The research advocated utilizes these results to  explore procedures for the energy efficient synthesis of arbitrary  combinational logic functions.  The methodology employed in the  study is based on a rigorous analytical approach, with simulation  results and measurements on actual fabricated circuits being used  for model verification and refinement.    It is widely known that clocking frequency seriously effects the  power dissipated in a system.  The utilization of double-edge-  triggered flip-flops, which trade area for clock frequencies  operating at half the value, represent a relatively inexpensive way  to reduce energy dissipation and naturally complements research in  low-power logic synthesis.  This work advocates studying techniques  to ensure that the systems built are fully testable.  The methods  of Boolean space expansion, and modified input storing elements,  are being explored to obtain full testability.    The goal of this research is the development of a new synthesis  tool which will enable users to easily implement digital functions  with reduced energy dissipation, while maintaining full  testability.  When an integrated circuit is operating in the  testing mode, the energy consumption may be far gr eater than during  normal operation as many internal nodes which do not usually switch  are being tested.  The proposed research will ensure that under  testing conditions the energy consumption of the system is minimal  thus avoiding damage to the circuit.",
