 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the sociology department at University             of Missouri-Kansas City for an REU Site which offers students a                 research experience in sociology during the summer.  Students will              be drawn primarily from junior colleges, regional colleges that                 attract large numbers of minority students from the Kansas City                 area, and from several small undergraduate colleges in the region               that have limited research opportunities for their students.  The               program will provide research opportunities for nine students for               ten weeks during the summer of 1993.                                                                                                                            The program has two educational components: (1) The structured                  component consists of daily instructional sessions, weekly                      colloquia, keeping a research journal (log), and one outside                    invited researcher colloquia; (2) The individualized component                  consists of four research groups composed of 2-3 students and one               faculty member working on a common research project.  The emphasis              of the research is on problem selection, approaches to literature               review, uses of secondary data sources, when appropriate, to                    address research problems, processing and analyzing secondary data,             collecting primary data when appropriate, and organizing and                    writing up findings into publishable/presentation form.  Additional             emphases within the program include teaching team work, learning                joint problem solving, utilizing time given competing ends, and                 working within budgetary constraints.  Students will work alongside             research faculty during the summer period and learn first-hand the              ways in which the research enterprise is conducted.                                                                                                             This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to                attract talented students into careers in science through active                undergraduate research experiences.",
