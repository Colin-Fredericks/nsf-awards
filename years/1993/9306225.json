 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the beliefs and behavior of Navajo                        mothers regarding control of early childhood food intake and                    its relationship to childhood obesity.  Subjects will                           include all mothers of children twelve to twenty-four months                    of age, and the appropriate children, residing in Pinon,                        Arizona,  a small, rural community on the navajo                                Reservation.  Also included for the study will be other                         caretakers of the children, trading post managers and staff,                    and health care workers in the community.  Ethnographic                         methods, including semi-structured interview and participant                    observation, and cognitive anthropological methods,                             including free listing and pile sorting, will be utilized to                    elicit information regarding food beliefs.  Structured                          observation will be used to determine the dietary intake of                     a subsample of the children.  Anthropometric measurements at                    various skinfolds sites will be obtained to determine which                     of the children are obese.  Mothers' food believes will be                      categorized and related to the children's obesity status.                       Results will augment the anthropological literature                             regarding cultural determinants of food behavior, and will                      be potentially useful to nutrition educators working with                       the Navajo to prevent childhood obesity and thereby the                         early onset of Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabests Mellitus.",
