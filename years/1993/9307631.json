 "awd_abstract_narration": "The prehensile tail exists within 5 New World primate genera (it                also has evolved independently in two suborders of reptiles, an                 order of amphibians, an six orders of mammals).  In the primates,               it clearly evolved twice.  Despite the importance of this                       structure, little is known regarding the function and pattern of                prehensile tail use in any primate genus.                                                                                                                       This study will contribute to an understanding of how and why the               prehensile tail is used by three primate genera - the howler                    (Alouatta), the spider monkey (Ateles), and the capuchin (Cebus).               Earlier suggestions that the prehensile tail was an effective                   adaptation allowing the suspension of large bodied animals in small             branch environments, where they could reach large fruits, for                   example, have become clearly insufficient. The feeding and                      positional behaviors of each of the three species will be compared              in two forests which differ in canopy structure and plant species               diversity.  This research will involve analysis of the resources                used by the primates and quantitative observation of their                      positional and feeding behavior.",
