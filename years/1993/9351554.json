 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351554  Shalhoub  Modular laser instrumentation is being developed for use in  upper-division chemistry courses and student research.  This  approach is advancing students' knowledge of modern  spectroscopy and demonstrating the applications of lasers in  chemistry.  Since most students are intrigued by lasers, they  are becoming more involved in hands-on experiments.  Students  are using a helium-cadmium laser, monochromator, and signal  enhancing instruments interfaced to a computer to investigate  the spectra of molecules.  Light emitted from laser-excited  molecules is directed through a monochromator and detected with  a lock-in amplifier.  Students are building instruments from  components to ensure that they understand the workings of what  is typically 'blackbox' equipment.  The new experiments are  replacing outmoded or redundant measurements in the physical  chemistry lab with the result that the curriculum now has a  better balance between thermodynamics and spectroscopy.  ***",
