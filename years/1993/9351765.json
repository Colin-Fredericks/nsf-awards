 "awd_abstract_narration": "Management of Alaska's wildlife populations is of fundamental                   importance to the biotic as well as the economic integrity of                   the nation and the state. This project gives undergraduates in                  wildlife biology exposure to the tools used in contemporary                     management of wildlife populations. This exposure is                            distributed among three courses taken during the sophomore,                     junior, and senior years. Students explore the dynamics of                      wildlife populations in the sophomore-level course; gain                        experience in gathering field data in the junior-level course;                  and synthesize data and project future population levels as                     seniors. Students also learn analytical techniques, with                        collaborative exercises, mimicking management teams used by                     resource management agencies. Students are expected to present                  results of their investigations to peers, both orally and in                    writing, to enhance communication skills.",
