 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the process of evolution by natural                               selection hinges on mechanistic understanding of two                            component processes: 1) differential survival and/or                            fecundity of individuals associated with the traits                             they possess and 2) the extent to which these traits                            are inherited.  Inheritance is the process by which an                          individual receives two copies of each gene as well as                          the extent to which the genes affect the expression of                          a trait.  Maternal inheritance is the special case when                         the mother via her own genes can directly affect the                            expression of a trait in her offspring.  This maternal                          effect is independent of the genes she passes on to her                         offspring.  This research is novel in that it will                              investigate the extent to which juvenile traits are not                         only determined by the genes an individual possesses,                           but also by the genes which its mother possesses.  This                         phenotypic connection between generation is common in                           many organisms and can include parental provisioning                            and parental care.  This non-standard form of                                   inheritance can alter direction and rate of adaptive                            evolution.  The goal of this research is to quantify                            the magnitude of this effect and examine how it might                           change the outcome of selection as it is observed in a                          natural population.  At the most basic level this                               research will provide an alternative mechanism for the                          evolution of juvenile and maternal traits in natural                            plant populations.                                                                                                                                              Breeders have developed a variety of breeding programs                          to enhance their ability to alter juvenile and maternal                         traits such as seed weight, emergence date and seed                             dispersal in plants and birth weight, gestation length                          and milk production in animals.  These programs                                 maximize the change in the trait of interest by                                 selection at the individual, sibling group, or family                           level depending on the nature of inheritance.  This                             research is an outgrowth of these applied problems in                           plant and animal breeding, but it will also make a                              contribution to this applied field by providing a                               mechanistic understanding of these non-standard forms                           of inheritance in plants.",
