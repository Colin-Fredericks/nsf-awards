Most of this award ($605,408)  provides funds to enable the NRC/BGC and other NRC committees and  boards to continue to provide assistance to agencies  participating with NSF in core functions of the FCCSET Committee  on Earth and Environmental Science's Subcommittee on Global  Change Research (CEES/SGCR) in the development and evaluation of  the U.S. Global Change Research Program (US/GCRP).  Through this  additional funding, which was contributed by agencies  participating as members in the CEES/SGCR, the NRC/BGC and  related NRC boards and committees will continue to fulfill their  responsibilities in the following areas:       1.  Provision of advice to the CEES/SGCR on the U.S. Global  Change Research Program (US/GCRP);       2.  Provision of periodic reviews of the US/GCRP;       3.  Service as a liaison between the U.S. and other nations  in international planning efforts; and       4.  Establishment and operation of special ad hoc groups to  address issues of special concern regarding the US/GCRP.         In addition to continuing these core activities, an  additional $121,532 is made available to NAS through interagency  transfer of funds from NOAA to support two related activities:       1.  NRC Ocean Studies Board efforts to supplement the work  of the NRC/BGC, particularly as it relates to the role of the  ocean in global change research (an activity to be funded at a  level of $50,000); and       2.  Support for the GOALS meeting conducted under the  auspices of the NRC Board on Atmospheric Science and Climate (an  activity to be funded at a level of $71,532).  ***",
