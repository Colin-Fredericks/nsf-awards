The surfaces to be studied are  copper (001) and Si(111).  The LEED data will be analyzed using a  holographic technique that shows great promise, but which has thus  far only been applied to simulated LEED patterns.  If successful,  the technique could lead to substantial reductions in the time  required for LEED analysis.  The principal investigator will  collaborate with the theorist responsible for developing the  holographic analysis method.   %%%  This project will support research at an undergraduate institution  that will involve the collection and analysis of low energy  diffraction (LEED) data.
