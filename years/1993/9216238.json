 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of the incredibly complex cytoarchitecture of the               nervous system is dependent upon the specificity of neuron:neuron               and neuron:glial cell intereactions.  One molecule that appears to              play a pivotal role in cell:cell interactions is the homophilic                 adhesion molecule, N-CAM. There are a number of forms of N-CAM,                 but the N-CAM 180 is the only isoform that is expressed                         exclusively in the nervous system.  Immunocytochemical studies                  show that this form is localized at developing synapses.  These                 observations suggest that the sequences encoded by exon 18 of the               N-CAM gene may play a unique role in synapse formation.  This                   Small Grant for Exploratory Research will allow the PI to examine               the role of N-CAM 180 in synapse formation.  The neural specific                exon of the N-CAM gene will be deleted in murine embryonic stem                 cells via homologous recombination.  Transgenic mice homozygous                 for the deleted gene will be made and studied for overt behavioral              abnormalities and defects in synapse formation.  These studies                  represent a newly emerging approach to directly study the function              of specific molecules in neural development in mammals using gene               targeting technology.",
