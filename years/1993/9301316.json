 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there have been major advances in the development                 of monte carlo strategies to obtain samples from high dimensional               nonnormalized joint densities.  These techniques have proved                    especially valuable in fitting structured random effects models.                In such settings,  Analytic examination of the posterior                        distribution is infeasible but sampling enables arbitrarily                     accurate estimation of any features of the posterior with the                   promise of fitting an enormous range of previously inaccessible                 models attention must now turn to the development of tools for                  bayesian data analysis.  Consistent with the informality of the                 art of model development we propose to develop informal tools                   with an eda flavor to mesh naturally with the sampling based                    approaches used to fit the model.  Application will be in two                   Biometric areas, quantal bioassay and geographic disease mapping.                    CONTEMPORARY STATISTICAL WORK IS DRIVEN BY SERIOUS                         Applications.  Realistic Models in such applications will                       necessarily be complex incorporating many unknowns.  Indeed,                    there may be several plausible models with collected data, the                  question arises of how to fit such models with several choices                  of models we might ask if any of them are good and which one we                 prefer.  The role of the data analyst is to provide answers to                  these questions.  The proposed research is intended to help the                 data analyst by providing a unifying strategy for carrying out                  the fitting and an associated set of tools for studying adequacy                of and choice of models at the heart of the entire approach is                  the most elementary of statistical ideas - drawing samples to                   learn about model unknowns.  We propose to utilize this approach                in two biometric areas of application.  One considers geographic                patterns of disease occurrence.  The other involves the change in               toxicity to a population due to change in exposure to a toxin.",
