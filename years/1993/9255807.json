 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to create an interactive computer                         program and database titled Datascope that will be a                            storehouse of environmental information.  The most                              comprehensive data now available on natural resource and                        environmental issues in 146 countries of the world will be                      used as a source of information for this program.  Students                     will be able to manipulate this database, add their own data                    and seek solutions to environmental problems with the aid of                    developed support materials and an education software                           program.  The project is well designed and would make a                         valuable environmental database available in an interactive                     format that students could use in solving real problems.                        Students could gain experience in data manipulation,                            mapping, analysis, data use and understanding.  Portions of                     the program could be used in the social sciences equally                        well.  Methods have been outlined where WRI will work with                      TERC and the Canadian Space Agency to develop a student and                     teacher guide to data analysis and interpretation.",
