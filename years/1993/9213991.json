 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the theoretical properties of                         intertemporal general equilibrium models and explores the                       possibilities for applying these models to analyze such policy                  changes as the free trade agreement currently being negotiated by               Canada, Mexico, and the United States.  The project has three                   components.  The first is a theoretical investigation of equilibria             of dynamic games with a large number of agents.  In this kind of                model, agents' actions do not have effects that can feed back by                changing all other agents' actions.  This feature makes these games             simpler to analyze than repeated games that focus on punishment                 strategies and effects of reputation.  This simplicity allows the               introduction of state variables, such as wealth holdings and                    capital goods, that play an important role.                                                                                                                     The second component of the project is a theoretical and empirical              investigation of how an intertemporal general equilibrium model                 with endogenous debt constraints can explain variations in                      individual consumption.  The economies with debt constraints will               be studied and the qualitative features of their equilibria will be             contrasted with those of economies with more traditional borrowing              constraints.  Two models will be constructed and calibrated to                  Consumer Expenditure Survey Data to study how well debt constraints             explain patterns in life-cycle consumption and responses of                     consumption to shocks in individual income.                                                                                                                     The third component of the project is the development of criteria               for evaluating the performance of applied general equilibrium                   models.  The results of this study would aid in the development of              a dynamic model to analyze the impact of a potential free trade                 agreement on the economies of Canada, Mexico, and the United                    States.",
