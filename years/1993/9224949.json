 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study will determine the roles of a number of                               population-level processes, including genetic drift,                            migration, and local population extinction and                                  recolonization, in determining the patterns of genetic                          differentiation among populations in nature.                                    Population demographic data will be compared with                               genetic data to test theories concerning the effects of                         these various factors.  The study animal is the swallow                         bug Oeciacus vicarius an ectoparasite exclusively of                            cliff swallows in Nebraska.  Populations of swallow                             bugs undergo regular cycles of local population growth                          and extinction due to the ephemeral use of colony sites                         by the cliff swallow host.  They are thus ideally                               suited for studies of the population genetic effects of                         dynamic factors such as extinction and recolonization.                          A longterm (10-year) database is available which                                details colony site usage and migration patterns for                            the cliff swallow hosts.  The east with which important                         population parameters for these bugs may be estimated                           makes possible a population genetic unusual in both its                         precision and broad scope.  The study will expand basic                         understanding of the fundamental process of genetic                             differentiation in natural populations, and will                                empirically test classical static (equilibrium)                                 theories of population genetic structure against more                           recently proposed dynamic models.  At a practical                               level, the study will provide general insights into the                         importance of various natural effects, such as local                            population extinction, in determining the overall level                         of genetic diversity for a species.  This information                           is of considerable importance to conservation                                   biologists as a guide in formulating effective                                  strategies for maintaining species genetic diversity in                         the wild.",
