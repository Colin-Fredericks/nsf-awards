 "awd_abstract_narration": "9214089  Bishop  This award supports Professor Georgia A. Bishop of Ohio State University  and a postdoctoral associate to collaborate in neurobiological research  with Dr. K. Q. Do of the Brain Research Institute of the University of  Zurich, Switzerland.  Dr. Bishop has been studying the anatomical  distribution, brainstem origin and electrophysiological effects of  several chemical messengers in the mammalian cerebellum.  Dr. Do and her  research group have worked on defining mechanisms of release and  reuptake of various amino acids and peptides from brain tissue in vitro.   Together they plan to study the mechanisms which regulate the release of  the neuropeptide corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) from nerve  terminals within the rodent cerebellum.  Their approach combines their  complementary expertise and facilities for physiological methods (Dr.  Bishop) and biochemical techniques (Dr. Do).  Dr. Bishop will work for  several months in Dr. Do's well-equipped laboratory to begin the joint  research and learn certain techniques which she will carry back to her  research group in the U.S. for further use in coordinated but parallel  studies.    This research is an attempt to resolve technically challenging  analytical problems in order to further our understanding of the role of  neuromodulators in the central nervous system.  CRF has been ascribed  such a role; however, to date, there are no data available on the  conditions under which this peptide is released from axon terminals.   The goal of the proposed cooperative research, determining how CRF is  released from terminals in the cerebellum, is a necessary step toward  understanding how neuromodulators regulate the activity of neurons.",
