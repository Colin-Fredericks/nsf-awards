Shivpuri of                          the Physics Department at the University of Delhi, and                          a number of his graduate students, for collaborative                            research with a team of U.S. scientists working at                              Fermi Laboratory.  The U.S. team includes Dr. John                              Peoples at Fermi Lab. and Dr. Paul Slattery at the                              Universsity of Rochester.  The Indian scientists and                            graduate students will participate in a multi-institution                       experiment at Fermi Laboratory.   The experiment                                E706 is designed to study interactions of protons, pions                        and kaons in a variety of targets, triggering on high                           transverse momentum (>5 GeV/C) electromagnetic                                  showers.  It is a second generation fixed target                                experiment using high energy beams (800 GeV protons                             from Fermilab Tevatron) and with a wide acceptance                              spectrometer, it is intended to reach approximately 10                          GeV/C.  A goal of the experiment is to obtain                                   information on quark and gluon interactions in                                  collisions of positive pions, negative pions and protons                        with nucleons.  The Indian scientists participation                             includes building detectors, data acquisition and data                          analysis.                                                                                                                                                       Scope:  This is a renewal of work currently under the                           leadership of Dr. Peoples at Fermilab, Dr. P. Slattery                          of the University of Rochester, and of Dr. R. Shivpuri                          of the University of Delhi.  The collaboration is                               considered quite successful, and a number of joint                              publications have resulted.  The project fits the U.S.-                         India Cooperative Science Program objectives.",
