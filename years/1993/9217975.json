This project is an                  effort to solve the central questions in string theory and quantum              gravity.  The goals are to develop an understanding and complete                formulation of the non-perturbative dynamics through the                        investigation of exactly solvable low-dimensional models, and to                ultimately apply these results to higher-dimensional theories and               the physics of black holes, early cosmology, and ultra-high energy              physics where present theories are known to break down.                         Specifically the research will involve matrix models, conformal                 field theory, non-perturbative string dynamics, symmetry breaking,              w-symmetry, topological phases, and high-energy behavior.                                                                                                       The principal investigators have already uncovered some of the key              aspects of the rich dynamics of these theories and have                         collaborated in developing an action principle.  This research                  project will enable them to vigorously expand these lines of                    research and extend the collaboration to include the related                    efforts of other colleagues.",
