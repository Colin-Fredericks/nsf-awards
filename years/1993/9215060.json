 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a one day symposium to be               held at the annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists                in Vancouver, Canada in December, 1992.  This meeting is co-                    sponsored with the Canadian Society of Zoologists.  The symposium               consists of eleven 30-minute presentations.  The speakers take a                multidisciplinary approach that cuts across taxonomic and                       conceptual lines, namely mammals, lower vertebrates, and                        invertebrates; empirical versus theoretical studies; individual                 level versus population level studies.  Interactions among such a               diverse group of researchers should: 1) lead to an assessment of                knowledge on the evolution of intraspecific predation and its                   impact on a species' population dynamics and its role in its                    community 2) identify information gaps 3) delineate new                         directions for future research and 4) facilitate the transfer of                conceptual and technical information from one sub-discipline to                 another.  A one day symposium together with contributed paper and               poster session is planned; this is an ideal time frame for                      assessing progress in a developing area of inquiry.",
