 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of fiber-optic sensors in conjunction with florescence                  spectroscopy has found many uses in biochemistry, immunoassays,                 closed-aquaculture systems and other applications.  However, the                use of in situ fluorescence measurement during filed tests has                  been hampered by the physical limitations of spectrometers                      related to their size, weight and stability.  To fulfill the need               of a compact and portable spectrometer compatible with fiber-                   optic sensors in detection/analysis of fluorescence spectrum,                   American Research Corporation of Virginia proposes a novel fiber-               optic Fourier-transform spectrometer (FOFTS) having no moving                   parts.  Optical-path difference is achieved by the use of                       electrically addressed phase modulators in one of the Mach-                     Zehnder interferometric beam paths.  This design provides rapid                 scanning, light weight and cost-effectiveness without                           compromising the performance of the spectrometer.  The technical                objectives of the Phase I program include selection of optical                  components for a fiber-optic interferometer, evaluation of                      methods to achieve optical-phase modulation, calibration of                     optical-phase modulators using laser and broadband light sources                and acquisition of families of fluorescence data.",
