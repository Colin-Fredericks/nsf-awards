 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306381  THOMAS    This project addresses the question of how coral reef communities  maintain high productivity in regions of nutrient depleted waters.  Work by Atkinson has demonstrated that by assuming phosphate (P)  uptake is mass transfer limited, productivity can be predicted from  physical parameters (i.e. P concentration, water velocity, water  depth, and bottom roughness). To make these predictions, Atkinson  has developed a model that uses correlations of mass transfer to  engineering type surfaces from engineering literature. A scaling  parameter is used to adjust these correlations for the biologically  rough surfaces of coral reef communities. The value for this  scaling factor (6.4) is based on measurements of nutrient uptake to  coral reef communities. Without this scaling factor, engineering  correlations do not accurately predict rates of mass transport of  nutrients into coral reef communities. The difference between the  rates of mass transfer predicted by engineering correlations and  those empirically measured are likely due to the differences  between the types of surfaces used in the experiments. Engineering  data have been obtained for surfaces that are rough on a single  spatial scale while the roughness of biological surfaces can occur  at multiple scales. Rates of mass transfer into rough surfaces are  a function of both roughness and the friction coefficient of the  community. To accurately quantify the relationship between mass  transfer of nutrients and productivity in coral reef communities,  it is essential that we be able to measure both of these parameters  for coral reef communities.        The primary goal of this research project is to develop  techniques to measure the surface roughness of coral reef  communities and to determine how this roughness affects their  friction coefficients. These measurements in combination with  measurements of nutrient transport within experimental reef  communities will provide the data necessary to develop a larger  proposal  for a theoretical model that links mass transfer with  productivity in coral reef communities. The objectives of this  project are: 1) to empirically measure friction coefficients for  coral reef communities that vary in their degree of roughness; 2)  to develop a biologically relevant measurement of community  roughness; 3) to correlate these roughness measurements with the  measured friction coefficients; and 4) to determine the  relationships between the measured friction coefficients, roughness  parameters, and enhancement of mass transfer.   ***",
