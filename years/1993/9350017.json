 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will build a regional coalition to                          coordinate the mathematics in-service activities of several                     large and complicated systems.  Working with local consortia                    of business, basic education, and higher education leaders                      working to achieve educational reform, the project director                     and senior staff will coordinate the mathematics teacher                        enhancement activities of these groups.  The objectives                         include ascertaining 1) mathematics in-service needs, 2)                        equipment and technology needs, 3) the types of in-service                      materials needed, 4) the appropriate role of mathematics                        specialists, and 5) how to meet the needs of a growing                          population traditionally underrepresented in the                                mathematical sciences.  Other objectives include summarizing                    the findings of relevant literature and research, and                           beginning work on a model mathematics curriculum and model                      school infrastructure.  The project will culminate with the                     submission of a Teacher Enhancement Program proposal.  To                       accomplish these objectives the proposers will form a                           national and a regional advisory board composed of leaders                      from the constituencies served by the grant activities.                         During the twelve months of the grant the project director                      and four senior staff members will meet weekly.  The                            Regional Advisory Board will meet monthly, while the                            National Advisory Board will conduct business via the mail                      and telephone.  Th grant activities will benefit all schools                    served by Intermediate Units                                                    model for cooperative efforts to improve mathematics                            instruction involving basic and higher education                                institutions, business and industry, government, teachers,                      and parents.",
