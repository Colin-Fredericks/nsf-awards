Experiments are planned to (1) investigate the  transport and fluctuation of light in colloidal crystals,  especially the effects of defects and structural correlations; (2)  apply these new spectroscopies to study the evolution more complex  turbid material such as slurries, sand piles, gels, microemulsions,  and foams; (3) explore the fundamental aspects of traveling waves  of light energy density that are produce when amplitude modulated  light sources are introduced into a turbid medium; and (4) continue  our studies of the dynamical and structural correlations in dense  colloidal suspensions of particles.  The knowledge gained by these  studies will improve our fundamental understanding of new kinds of  materials, will extend our knowledge of the properties of diffusing  light, and will lead to new techniques for imaging opaque materials  with diffusing light.  The project involves active collaboration  with scientists at Exxon Research and Engineering Corporation,  Annandale, New Jersey.  %%%  Diffuse light emerging from granular media can be analyzed to gain  information about the structure and dynamics of the particles  making up the scattering medium.  For example scattered light is  beginning to be used in mammography and other non-destructive  analytical techniques.  This project will develop and apply  diffusing-light probes to the study of the structure and dynamics  of a range of turbid materials.  Among these are slurries, sand  piles, gels, microemulsions, and foams.  The knowledge gained by  these studies will improve our fundamental understanding of new  kinds of materials, will extend our knowledge of the properties of  diffusing light, and will lead to new techniques for imaging opaque  materials with diffusing light.  The project involves active  collaboration with scientists at Exxon Research and Engineering  Corpor ation, Annandale, New Jersey.  ***",
