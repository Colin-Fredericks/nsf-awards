 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the three-year Science Education Enrichment                    Program is to provide 720 Puerto Ricans, six to fourteen years of               age, with exploratory learning opportunities to observe, judge, and             value scientific experiences.  The program will be administered by              the Agricultural Extension Service of the University of Puerto                  Rico.  The 4-H curriculum will be strengthened by incorporating                 interactive learning in six science components:  Composting as a                Means to Conserve the Environment: The Role of Soil and Water in                Protecting Life; Food Discoveries: Starchy (Farinaceous)                        Vegetables:  From Field to Market; Getting to Know about Insects;               and Hurricanes and Earthquakes: Events Requiring Disaster                       Mitigation>  Extension Specialists in the subject matter and a                  research scientist from the Experiment Station will supervise                   groups of 10-20 children at 63 sites in sessions lasting from six               months to a year.  Trained volunteers and teen leaders will also                participate.  A distinguished group of external advisors will serve             on an Advisory Committee to provide recommendations on scientific               accuracy and future development.  Three implementation phases ate               planned.  In Phase I a draft of a unique Puerto Rican science                   curriculum model for the Extension Service will be prepared.  The               skills and knowledge of component directors will be enhanced                    through collaboration with local and mainland groups to leverage                resources for special training on exploratory approaches to                     learning science.  In Phase II the curriculum will be tested and                refined.  Resources will be mobilized for exploratory science                   activities.  A pilot session will be held for 80 youth.  During                 Phase III all components will be operational>  Approximately 640                youth will participate in 58 science session.  A dissemination                  plan will allow for the curriculum materials to be distributed to               groups in Puerto Rico and the mainland. The current level of effort             will be continued and plans will be made for expansion to other                 sites.  Institutional commitments to the development of this                    project include an in-kind contribution amounting to approximately              22 percent of the total project amount.  In addition to creating an             interest in science, the outcomes of the program will seek to build             self confidence in science exploration, promote critical thinking,              and develop knowledge in youth about career options in the                      agricultural sciences.",
