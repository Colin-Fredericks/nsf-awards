 "awd_abstract_narration": "9254458  August, John    This 3-year project aims at giving 3 groups of 24 well-  prepared, motivated high school teachers from the Mid-Atlantic  region an indepth experience in mathematical modeling.   Participating schools are asked to send teams (consisting of  1 mathematics and 1 science teacher) to a 1-year (spring-  summer-fall) program.  The capstone of the program is the week  the teachers spend on-site at the Chincoteague National  Wildlife Refuge, working on modeling problems of current  interest to the Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the  Refuge (for example, beach erosion, migration, traffic, and  the like).  In the 6 months prior to the summer field  experience, the teachers will learn some of the mathematics  that underlies modeling by attendiing 6 2-day workshops.  In  the post-summer fall semester, the teachers turn their  attention to such educational issues as:  how to use their  summer experience to their students'advantage; writing lesson  plans in modeling; sharing their knowledge with other  teachers; etc.  The project emphasizes writing, and the  results of the teachers' work (reports, charts, graph, etc.)  will be made available to the Wildlife Service and the 1.5  million annual visitors to the Refuge.  The project evaluation  will focus on changes in the teachers, their classrooms, their  colleagues, and their schools.  ***",
