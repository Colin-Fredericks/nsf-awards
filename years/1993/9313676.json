 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313676  Stegeman    Connecting micro- and broad-scale physical factors to growth in  calanoid copepods and larval cod and haddock is essential to the  US-GLOBEC Georges Bank Program.  Prior methods to measure growth  have involved morphometrics, life stage durations, egg production,  and indirect biochemical methods, such as the RNA/DNA ratio.  Dr.  Stegeman will utilize immunohistochemical, histological and  fluorometric methods to detect cell proliferation, continuing the  application of this technique in marine fish and invertebrates.   The method uses monoclonal antibodies to molecular markers of cells  synthesizing nuclear DNA to allow quanitification of such cells.   An early aim will be to establish which cell and organ  proliferation rates most closely reflect overall growth rate, as  measured morphometrically in larval fish, and by stage length in  copepods.  The time scale over which such differences can be  measured will be studied in a series of laboratory experiments.   Subsequently, they will participate in the US-GLOBEC Process  cruises that are being planned, to develop and apply the method at  sea.  Participation in this study will translate physical  measurements of vertical mixing and stratification, that fluctuate  as a result of short and long term climatic changes, into an  instant assay for the biological effects of such parameters.  ***",
