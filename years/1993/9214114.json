 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award will support U.S.-Sweden cooperative                      research in cognitive psychology between Elizabeth S. Spelke of                 the University of Cornell and Claes von Hofsten of Umea                         University, Umea, Sweden.  The investigators propose to study the               early development of knowledge of motion of physical objects                    through two different, yet parallel sets of experiments:  one using             looking methods of object identification (Cornell) and the other                utilizing predictive reaching methods (Umea).   They will                       investigate infants' knowledge and perception of physical properties            of objects such as gravity, inertia, continuity and solidity. Infants           will be presented with a fully visible or partly occluded moving                object and their responses measured accordingly.  The research                  attempts to answer two questions:  how infants' knowledge of the                physical world is developed and whether the same knowledge                      guides their inferences either through visual perception (looking) or           physical action (reaching).                                                                                                                                     Dr. Spelke brings to this collaboration her extensive background                and work on infants' understanding of physical properties of objects            and events.  This is complemented by Dr. von Hofsten's expertise                in the development of action and perception/action relationships in             infants.  The proposed experiments could not be conducted without               the unique equipment for investigating object-directed reaching in              infants which is only available in the Umea laboratory.  This                   cooperative research effort will advance knowledge of two larger                issues in cognitive psychology:  how humans learn to operate in                 and understand the physical world.",
