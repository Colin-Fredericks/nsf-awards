 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to obtain quantitative cloud                   condensation nuclei (CCN) data at Palmer Station, Antarctica, using             a CCN spectrometer of the principal investigator's own design.  The             project is integrated with a study of tropospheric sulfur chemistry             in order to examine the climatic negative feedback mechanism                    involving atmospheric CCN and the emission of dimethylsulfide (DMS)             from oceanic phytoplankton.  DMS is oxidized and converted to CCN               in the atmosphere, with the increased concentration of CCN leading              to more extensive marine stratus clouds.  The increased cloud                   cover, because it reflects a greater proportion of the incoming                 solar radiation, is hypothesized to produce large-scale atmospheric             cooling.  The net cooling and the reduced solar radiation at the                surface reduce the oceanic phytoplankton population and the rate of             DMS emission.                                                                                                                                                   The remote location of Palmer Station, and the establishment of the             two-year study of atmospheric sulfur chemistry offers a unique                  opportunity to study quantitative relationships, not only between               CCN and DMS, but also with other transient and stable sulfur                    compounds such as non-sea salt sulfates, methane sulfonate, and                 sulfuric acid, as well as dry aerosols and sea salt particles.",
