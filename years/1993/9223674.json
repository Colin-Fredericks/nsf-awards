 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large debate exists in public policy over the efficacy of anti-               poverty programs.  At the same time, research in sociology has                  concluded that an essential characteristic of inner city poverty                is its persistence.  Most of the recent analyses of poverty                     suffer from several weaknesses due to the lack of emphasis on                   poverty as a dynamic process.  In particular, these studies                     generally do not attempt to explain how nonpoor families ever                   become poor, not do they attempt to explore how some poor                       families can escape poverty.  Further, little attention has been                given to the dynamics of neighborhood formation, which is                       essential to understanding how policy initiatives, such as public               housing, school finance equalization or busing can reverse                      poverty.  The contribution of this project comes from studying                  the emergence of poverty and inequality as outcomes of a dynamic                process.  The project constructs an explicitly dynamic and                      stochastic model of neighborhood formation, human capital                       formation and occupational achievement.  The goal of this                       research is to understand how community influences on human                     capital formation can interact with endogenous community                        formation to produce rich and poor communities within the same                  economy.  The large sample of parents and offspring from the                    Panel Study on Income Dynamics is combined with per pupil                       expenditure data available from states' Boards of Education in                  order to test the substantive and policy implications of the                    theoretical research.                                                                                                                                           This project has three overall goals.  First, it continues to the               development of stochastic process methods of modelling                          heterogenous economies.  These methods should be generally useful               in developing dynamic models of incomplete markets and                          coordination failure.  Second, this work is applied to the study                of the dynamics of poverty and ghetto formation.  Third, a class                of coordination-based business cycle models are analyzed in order               to better understand the role of incomplete markets in aggregate                fluctuations.",
