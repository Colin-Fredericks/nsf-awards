 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lake-effect snows are produced by cold air flowing over warm               lake surfaces and are known for their severity and disruption to                life near the Great Lakes of the US and other locations around the              globe.                                                                               Convective boundary layers are the media through which cool                air masses are coupled to the warm underlying Earth's surface.                  Convective boundary layers responsible for lake-effect snowstorms               are particularly important because their accompanying clouds and                snow act as tracers to reveal the structure and organization of the             boundary layer when viewed by radar and instrumented aircraft.  In              addition, they are useful laboratories for study of the initiation              and growth of snow.                                                                  This project will analyze data from the Lake Snow Project and              will be carried out as a collaborative effort between the                       University of Illinois and North Carolina State University.  The                Principal Investigator from the University of Illinois will use                 vertical profiles of moisture fluxes and analyses of Doppler radar              winds and reflectivity to obtain a better description of small                  scale convective elements and their cloud and snow growth                       processes.                                                                           The Principal Investigator from North Carolina State                       University will use aircraft data to identify conditions associated             with the initial formation of ice particles in lake-effect clouds               and to determine relationships between cloud and snow                           characteristics and ambient and/or antecedent meteorological                    conditions.                                                                          Results from this research will be of value to boundary layer              meteorologists concerned with convection and, cloud physicists                  interested in ice nucleation and snow growth, and weather                       forecasters striving to predict lake-effect snow storms.",
