 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to elucidate mechanisms of                 sustained mycelial growth of wood-decaying fungi.  In the model                 organism, Schizophyllum commune, proteolysis and recycling of amino             acids supports mycelial growth during nitrogen limitation.  S.                  commune produces a wide range of proteolytic activities, including              members of the aspartic-, serine- and metallo-protease type                     enzymes.  Two proteases that have increased activities during                   nitrogen-limitation are ScPrA (a serine-endopeptidase) and ScPrB (a             metallo-endopeptidase).  In addition, two aminopeptidases and a                 carboxypeptidase are also regulated by nitrogen.  Objectives of the             work proposed are 1) to extend the study of the proteolytic system              in S. commune by using mutant analysis and molecular cloning of                 specific protease genes, and 2) to initiate studies designed to                 elucidate the regulatory mechanism(s) for proteases involved in                 intracellular protein turnover.  Mutants will be screened by                    ability to hydrolyze chromogenic peptide substrates and gelatin.                S. commune protease genes will be cloned using heterologous                     hybridization with protease genes from other fungi (particularly                yeast), and by transformation/complementation testing in mutant                 strains.  Cloned genes will be sequenced analyzed, and then used to             generate probes to measure RNA transcript levels and to localize in             situ protease mRNA under nitrogen-limiting conditions.  Regulation              of protease ScPrB by an endogenous inhibitor will be studied by                 standard biochemical techniques and mutant analysis.                            %%%                                                                             Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for all organisms.  In mushroom               producing fungi, nitrogen must be obtained from the material upon               which the organism grows.  Often this \"food\" (leaf litter, wood) is             a poor source of nitrogen.  This limits the growth of the organism.             However, even under nitrogen-poor conditions fungi may continue to              expand by digesting older portions of its body, and recycling                   nutrients to younger, growing areas.  The goal of the present work              is to understand the cell mechanism of protein-nitrogen recycling               in wood-decaying fungi.  We will characterize the cell machinery                required to digest proteins in older parts of the organism and see              how this machinery is regulated at the molecular level.  The                    research is important because it will provide insight into the                  basic cellular mechanism of protein and nitrogen metabolism of a                diverse group of organisms. This group of organisms includes the                edible mushroom, fungi that rot wood and wood products, and fungi               that are pathogens on corn and wheat.  An added objective is to                 provide research opportunities for undergraduate students to                    prepare them for careers in science and technology.                             This award is funded jointly by Metabolic Biochemistry (Division of             Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and the Functional and                      Physiological Ecology (Integrative Biology and Neuroscience)                    Programs.",
