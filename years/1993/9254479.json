 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 4-year project, involving a total of 80 K-8 teachers in                    the greater Boston area, has three basic aims: (1) to shift                     teachers' beliefs about the nature of teaching and learning                     mathematics; (2) to deepen and broaden the teachers' knowledge                  of mathematics itself; and (3) by capitalizing on (1) and (2),                  to introduce fundamentally new instructional practices into                     the classroom.  In Phase I (Years 1 and 2), the 3                               participating districts each send a team of 8 teachers to the                   program, and--to  help assure district-wide, systemic change--                  a principal, a mathematics supervisor and an associate                          superintendent as well.  The format of the program in each of                   the four years of the project is similar:  a 4-week summer                      institute, followed during the ensuing school year by \"inquiry                  groups\" (facilitated by project staff) that meet every other                    week after school.  Year 1 focuses on initiating fundamental                    changes in the participating teachers' beliefs and practices;                   in year 2, the same teachers change their beliefs and                           practices also.  In Phase II (Years 3 and 4) the project                        begins a collaboration with EdCo--a consortium of school                        districts in the greater Boston Area.  Phase II involves 36                     new teachers.  Research/evaluation is an important component                    of the program that seeks to document and understand in rather                  fine detail the histories (external and internal) of the                        teachers in the process of trying to make radical changes in                    their professional views and practices.  Finally, a                             dissemination strand aims at developing teachers enhancement                    materials for use by others, which will be publicized by                        participants and project staff at a variety of professional                     meetings.",
