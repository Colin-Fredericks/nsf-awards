The workshop deliberations                                  should lead to recommendations on more wide-                                    spread utilization of existing technologies to                                  cope with energy requirements in the immediate                                  future; and the development of new                                              energy/industrial/agricultural technology that                                  will avoid the threat to our ecological system.                                                                                                                                                                                                 Scope:  The workshop is highly relevant to                                      scientists from the US and India since it will                                  synthesize information on global and regional                                   climate variability and discuss sustainable                                     development and energy use measures that need                                   to be taken into account by countries adversely                                 affected by climate change scenarios.  Common                                   issues to be addressed include forest and                                       coastal zone management, groundwater storage,                                   adaptation to likely shifts in agricultural                                     patterns and aquatic productivity associated                                    with the expected rise in global temperature                                    from the greenhouse effect.",
