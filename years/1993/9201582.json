 "awd_abstract_narration": "To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,               the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of                  NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical                      Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a distinguished                    lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic of important                      current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical                sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                     monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published                by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                         Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are: (1) Focus on a                   single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner, (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through                regional emphasis, (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                   timeliness, and (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.                       This grant is to the Conference Board of the Mathematical                  Sciences (CBMS) to help fund its activities in promoting,                       administering, and providing support services for the conference                series.",
