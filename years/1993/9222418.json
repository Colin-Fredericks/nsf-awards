 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves a study of the materials science and physics             of the growth of very high-quality GaAs/AlxGa1-x heterojunction thin-           film structures using the molecular beam epitaxy technique, and the             new electron interaction physics expected to manifest in such ideal             electron systems.  Very low-disorder, dilute two-dimensional (2D)               electron and hole systems at the GaAs/AlGaAs interface in the                   regime of very small Landau level fillings where transitions                    between quantum liquid and solid states of the system are expected              will be studied.  Several novel quasi-2d systems with an additional             degree of freedom will also be studied.  These include systems                  which contain two or more layers of electrons in close proximity so             that interlayer Coulomb interactions are strong, and thick-layer                electron systems in wide parabolic wells.  The additional degree of             freedom in these structures is expected to lead to new collective               sates such as the recently observed fractional quantum Hall state               at the even 1/2 denominator filling in a double-layer electron                  system.  These systems will be probed via low-temperature                       magnetotransport measurements.                                                  %%%                                                                             The impact of this advanced materials research program is two-fold.             First, optimization of molecular beam epitaxy growth techniques to              produce very high-quality, selectively-doped interfaces and                     heterostructure thin-films with the least amount of imperfections               can be useful for the fabrication of other advanced semiconductor               structures and devices.  Second, these low-disorder structures will             make accessible a new regime in semiconductor physics where new                 physical phenomena are expected to arise from the electron-electron             interactions.",
