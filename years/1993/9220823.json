 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns OxlT, a novel transport protein in                        Oxalobacter formigenes, a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium.  OxlT              catalyzes the exchange of external divalent oxalate for internal                monovalent formate.  This electrogenic exchange, along with proton              consumption during intracellular decarboxylation, constitutes an                indirect proton pump that generates a proton-motive force as the                cell extracts \"metabolic energy\" from oxalate.  It appears that                 this pattern is replicated by other reactions in other cells, and               that indirect proton pumps may be common in microbiology.  To                   understand this event at the molecular level, we propose to study               OxlT, the antiport protein.  Presently, we have methods to purify               and reconstitute OxlT, and we have raised anti-OxlT polyclonal                  antibodies that will aid us in cloning the oxlT gene.  With                     purified protein and a cloned gene, we will raise peptide-specific              antibodies and construct gene fusions to aid in the determination               of transport protein structure.  Site-directed mutagenesis will be              used to further characterize the structure/function properties of               the enzyme together with biochemical and biophysical methods to                 determine the minimal functional unit (monomeric or dimeric), .-                helical content and the binding properties of the protein.                      %%%                                                                             We have shown that the microorganism, Oxalobacter formigenes, has               a novel mechanism to harvest energy from its environment.  This                 cell uses a specific membrane protein, termed OxlT, to bring                    divalent oxalate molecules into the cell in exchange for monovalent             formate, which is simultaneously pumped out of the cell.  The                   formate, which is required to complete the exchange cycle is                    generated by degradation of oxalate after the molecule is brought               into the cell.  The asymmetric exchange of negatively charged ions              results in the formation of a membrane potential across the cell                membrane, that the cell can then use to make additional energy and              grow.  At the heart of this new mechanism of energy formation is                the membrane protein, OxlT.  We will use the tools of molecular                 biology (cloning, mutagenesis), immunology (specific antibodies).               biochemistry (purification and reconstitution) and biophysics                   (spectroscopy) to study the structural and functional properties of             the enzyme to help us understand how such an unusual membrane                   \"pump\" protein, such as this one, operates to provide extra energy              for the cells.",
