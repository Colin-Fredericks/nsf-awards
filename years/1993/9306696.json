 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306696  Kvam    An interdisciplinary effort will be followed to examine the  growth fundamentals and structure of CVD growth of SeGe alloys on  Si(100), over insulating layers and in constrained  configurations.  Studies will emphasize seeded epitaxial  overgrowth of both two- and three-dimensionally constrained  growth configurations.  The near-term target of this research is  the fundamental understanding and reliable controlled production  of heterostructure layers within a fully confined cavity by  epitaxial lateral overgrowth.  Highly strained and strain-  relieved materials will be examined for their microstructural  integrity.  The effects of limited lateral dimensions may be  tailored to remove defects from device regions.  Surface infrared  spectroscopy, in combination with kinetic modeling, will be used  to analyze the behavior of the growth, carrier and etching gas  species to provide quantitative descriptions of growth behavior  in both full wafer and seeded epitaxial growth.  Oxidation due to  atmospheric exposure and to thermal treatment will also be  examined.  %%%  Novel growth configurations(selective and confined) are proposed  to employ SiGe layers in Si for high-speed transistors and  optoelectronic devices.  Surface reactions which control this  growth, and the quality of the materials produced, will be  assessed.  Structural integrity of strained layers and practical  oxidation processes(both protective and harmful) will be  examined.  Modeling will be done for use in fundamental process  understanding and industrial scale-up.  This research will enable  reliable uniformity even in highly integrated three dimensional  structures and lead to  improving the general performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications.  ***",
