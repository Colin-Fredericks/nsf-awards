 "awd_abstract_narration": "93015308  Tasker    The hypothalamus is the brain structure that through its link  with the pituitary gland, is responsible for controlling most of  the organism's basic reproductive and homeostatic functions.   Pituitary hormones are released into the blood circulation on  command from the hypothalamus and are carried to endocrine and  muscle targets, where they cause steroid secretion or muscle  contraction.  As might be expected from the wide range of  functions of pituitary hormones, there is a diversity of hormone-  secreting systems in the hypothalamus, each activated under  different conditions and with different release profiles.  Dr.  Tasker is interested in determining whether the distinct  hypothalamic secretory systems interact to alter one another's  secretion.  For example, the hormone systems responsible for  lactation and for the body's stress response are both located in  the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.   Empirical  evidence points to an interaction between these two systems since  emotional stress can suppress a mother's ability to provide milk  to her young, and breast feeding provided the mother with a  temporary feeling of calm and well being.  Dr. Tasker will employ  electrophysiological and neuroanatomical technique to examine  integrative interactions among two subpopulations of neurons  located within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus.  By  combining the simultaneous intracellular and whole-cell patch-  clamp recordings, intracellular dye injection and  immunohistochemical, he will detect synaptic intercommunication  between neurons that synthesize and release different hormones.   These findings will provide new insights about the basic  functioning of the hypothalamus.  In addition, knowledge about  the interdependence of neurosecretory functions and behavior will  increase our understanding of how seemingly disparate  physiological responses of the body influence one another.      ***",
