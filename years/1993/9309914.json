 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ilumoka         A high proportion of future integrated systems will contain  mixed analog/digital subsystems required to meet demanding  quality specifications.  CAD (computer-aided design) tools  currently available for integrated circuit (IC) quality  enhancement (or robust design) although effective are plagued by  the problem of high simulation cost, the greatest part of which  is due to circuit simulation and extraction of performance.  This  problem arises due to the fact that accurate prediction of  circuit performance requires that ICs be modeled at a number of  different levels of abstraction including process, layout, device  and circuit levels.  Furthermore, since current methodologies  simulate several instances of the IC in order to investigate  quality, the cost problem is compounded.         To date, research efforts to reduce simulation costs have  produced a number of approximation techniques which sacrifice  accuracy for reduction in computational cost.  Thus, although the  cost problem is ameliorated, simulator output has significant  error.  Artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a non-  parametric method for mapping one set of data to another based on  information established during an adjustment procedure called  \"training\".  Research is focused on the study of improved robust  design techniques for MOSFET ICs which exploit the versatile  mapping capability of ANNs.",
