 "awd_abstract_narration": "An information-processing, resource-allocation theory is used to                investigate motivational and self-regulatory mechanisms as they                 affect the acquisition and maintenance of complex decision-making               performance in jobs demanding highly skilled performance.  Air                  traffic controllers will be used at the target skill group in this              project.  Key determinants of self-monitoring strategies and                    competency judgments, their interrelations, and their associations              with performance are evaluated using an integrative                             aptitude/treatment interactions approach.                                                                                                                       Three studies examine the influence of the information environment              on self-regulatory activities and task performance.  These studies              have implications for the development of training interventions to              maximize on-task attentional effort and skill development in                    cognitively demanding, information-rich jobs.  A second series of               studies examines cognitive ability, task conception, and                        motivational determinants of individual differences in competency               judgments of aspects of performance.  The findings of these studies             have implications for understanding the role of conative processes              in skill acquisition, as well as for the development of more                    precise non-cognitive selection measures for the prediction of                  performance in complex jobs involving protracted training.  The use             of a high-fidelity work task simulation permits the integrations of             laboratory findings with results obtained in two longitudinal field             studies, and provides critical information for ultimate                         implementation in training and on-the-job situations.",
