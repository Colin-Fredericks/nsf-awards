 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Living in Water\" is a hands-on instructional program in                        life science for upper elementary/middle school grades.                         Dr. Valerie Chase, a biologist and educator at the National                     Aquarium in Baltimore, developed this program with support                      from NSF's Instructional Materials Development Program.                         Teachers in the Chesapeake Bay region have been given access                    to training workshops for a number of years, and Dr. Chase                      now plans to offer training to teachers from across the                         country. Summer workshops would be offered at Towson State                      University for three years, providing training for 72                           \"regional master teachers\".  These workshop participants                        would learn to teach \"Living in Water\" in their own                             classrooms, and they would gain a deeper understanding of                       the biology, chemistry, and physics that underlie the                           activities in the curriculum. Each of these teachers would                      provide training to other teachers in their home region.                                                                                                        This national dissemination project would 1) train teachers                     as teacher-trainers for an NSF-supported curricular unit, 2)                    establish a national newsletter for users of the unit, 3)                       support an NSTA short course to introduce the unit to a wide                    audience, and 4) result in an update of the unit based on                       input from an Advisory Board and the expanded pool of users.                    \"Living in Water\" is a unique and high quality instructional                    program, and these teacher training activities will                             disseminate it to classrooms across the country.                                                                                                                Cost sharing represents 46% of the NSF contribution.",
