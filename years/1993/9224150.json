Project funding will enable the team                         from Cairo University to work for various periods of                            time in the laboratory of Dr. Sean Washburn at UNC                              as well as the IBM Watson Research Center.                                      Additionally, Dr. Washburn will spend one week visiting                         the laboratory of Dr. Khalid Ismail of Cairo University.                        The investigators will perform a series of transport                            experiments on small point contacts, lateral resonant                           tunneling devices, and interferometers.  The proposed                           experiments will (1) extend the study of ballistic                              transport to new materials systems, (2) provide a                               broader base of experimental data to test theoretical                           predictions on ballistic transport, (3) provide the first                       system for experimental data for testing recent                                 predictions of conductance quantization in                                      one-dimensional Luttinger liquid, and (4) allow testing                         of new predictions for electrostatic interference effects.                      This project in materials research fulfills the program                         objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling                         leading experts in the United States and Egypt to                               combine complementary talents and pool research                                 resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
