Realistic                                        constitutive models will allow incorporation of                                 many factors such as nonlinear material                                         behavior, insitu stresses, and discontinuities                                  very often ignored or highly simplified in the                                  past.  Together with modern computational                                       methods the resulting procedures will permit                                    solutions of highly complex problems which are                                  difficult to solve using conventional methods.                                  A unique aspect of the research is the                                          integration of basic mathematical modelling for                                 realistic characterization of the behavior of                                   materials, implementation of models in non-                                     linear computational procedures, and                                            verification of field behavior of typical                                       structures.  The collaboration is between                                       Drs. C.S. Desai, University of Arizona and A.                                   Varadarajan, Indian Institute of Technology,                                    New Delhi.                                                                                                                                                      Scope:  Results of the research will benefit                                    applications of advanced constitutive models                                    and computer procedures for the development of                                  rational structures for river valley projects                                   both in India and the U.S.  This type of                                        research is particularly relevant in the U.S.                                   as significant research work is in progress in                                  constitutive modelling of geologic materials                                    and discontinuities, development of new                                         laboratory devices, implementation of                                           constitutive models in computer methods and                                     verification through laboratory/field studies.                                  A formal collaboration will be of mutual                                        benefit.",
