 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304309  Habicht    The cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF),  and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are major immunoregulatory molecules,  produced by macrophages, that act as molecular orchestrators of  host defense mechanisms against a variety of environmental insults.   The immunological effects of these cytokines are many.  Equally  important are their effects as mediators of nonspecific host  defense mechanisms.  The exquisite action of cytokines in fine  tuning and controlling the inflammatory/immune response led to the  hypothesis that these molecules have been highly conserved through  evolution.  It was reasoned that IL-1 or a similar ancestral  cytokine is likely to be present in the invertebrates for several  reasons.  First, the molecular conservation of IL-1 and its host  defense functions have been preserved in the vertebrates.  Second,  macrophages which produce IL-1 are present throughout the animal  kingdom.  Echinoderms and urochordates belong to the deuterostomes  as do the vertebrates, while all the other invertebrates are  members of the protostomes.  Results from this laboratory have  demonstrated the presence of cytokines in both major groups of  invertebrates.  The goals of this research are to determine the  amino acid and DNA sequences of invertebrate IL-1 and TNF and  compare them with those of the vertebrates.  The functions of these  mediators in the invertebrates will be characterized using starfish  systems in vivo and in vitro.  %%%  The goal of this research is to characterize, in certain key  invertebrate animals, chemical regulators (cytokines) of their  immune-like defense mechanisms.  Study of these invertebrate  immune-like defense mechanisms will contribute to understanding of  how a wide range of organisms respond to environmental challenges.   In addition, investigation of the cytokines of more primitive  organisms may help us decipher the complex cellular and humoral  interactions of the immune systems of higher animals.  ***",
