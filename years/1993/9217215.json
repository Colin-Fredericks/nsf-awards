Silver, Carnegie Institution of                                         Washington, and David Mainprice and Alain Vauchez                               of the Technophysics Laboratory at the University                               of Montpellier in France.  The investigators will                               make measurement of shear-wave splitting on                                     teleseismic shear waves, and use them to study                                  the past and present deformation of continents                                  during tectonic events, such as orogenies and                                   rifting episodes.  The main objective of the                                    proposed research is to take measurements on                                    upper mantle deformation. In particular, the                                    investigators will study the relationship between                               mantle deformation and crust in various orogenic                                settings.  Measurements and observations will use                               data from stations in the Appalachian Mountains,                                the Basin and Range Province (western United                                    States) and the Pyrenees.                                                                                                                                       The proposed research requires knowledge in three                               distinct disciplines represented by the                                         participants. The U.S. investigator brings                                      expertise in seismology. This is complemented by                                French expertise in petrophysics and structural                                 geology. Results from the research will advance                                 our understanding of the evolution of continents                                and plate movement and tectonics.",
