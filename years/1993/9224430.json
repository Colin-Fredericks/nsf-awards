 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. William Isbell and his             colleagues will conduct an archaeological excavation at the site of             Iwawi, a small deeply stratified mound located at the mouth of the              Tiwanaku River on the Lake Titicaca shore in Bolivia. Preliminary               work by Dr. Isbell suggests that the site spans an approximately                2000 year period. Excavation through the habitation levels will                 yield faunal and floral remains as well as stone tools and abundant             ceramics. The team's focus will be on this last class. The primary              goal of the research is a refined stylistic sequence for ceramics,              employing computer assisted descriptions as well as more standard               analyses. A suite of radiocarbon dates will add absolute                        chronology. Four 10 x 10 meter excavations will be conducted on                 different sections of the mound. In addition to chronological data,             house floor contexts from these large excavations will provide an               excellent record of economics, household organization and social                differentiation within a changing regional sphere.                                                                                                              The Lake Titicaca basin saw the rise of one of the earliest                     civilizations in the New World. In this formidable high altitude                region Native Americans formed an empire marked by monumental                   architecture and control of an area which extends over much of                  present day Bolivia and Peru. Many archaeologists have worked in                the basin to trace the rise, spread and eventual decline of this                Tiwanaku culture. They have focussed on such topics as the                      agricultural techniques which allowed the support of large                      populations. The main problem which researchers face however is the             lack of a good ceramic chronology. Because ceramic styles change                over time, they can provide a sensitive dating technique which                  allow individual sites and levels within sites to be accurately                 placed. In the Titicaca region however the sequence currently                   employed is far from adequate and in need of revision. Dr. Isbell's             project will accomplish this goal.                                                                                                                              This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how civilizations arise and decline. It will               also provide a tool of use to many archaeologists.",
