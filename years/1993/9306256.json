The proposed process involves use                                     of a reactor that incorporates a hollow fiber                                   membrane contactor for removal of the                                           trichloroethylene from the contaminated                                         water, concentration of this contaminant in                                     an aqueous phenol solution followed by                                          biotreatment in a suspended growth                                              bioreactor.                                                                                                                                                     The proposal leading to this award was                                          submitted in accord with criteria contained                                     in the Program Announcement NSF 92-90,                                          Research Planning Grants and Career                                             Advancement Awards for Women Scientists and                                     Engineers.  Results of this project are                                         expected to provide guidance necessary in                                       development of a competitive proposal for                                       conduct of research that would lead to                                          engineering design criteria for a process                                       that could be utilized in decontamination of                                    groundwater.",
