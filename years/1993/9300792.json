 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study and classify the kinds of large-scale              restructuring of the global solar field which are related to                    Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs).  CMEs involve large-scale                        restructuring of the corona and the ejection of large amounts of                mass and energy into the heliosphere.  However, we know very little             about how or where CMEs originate or how they develop, so it is                 important to understand their relationship to the large-scale                   magnetic fields patterns near the solar surface and in the low                  corona.  We propose a two-part approach to this problem.  First, we             will study the source locations of Skylab and SMM CMEs determined               by mapping them onto synoptic maps for each solar rotation.  Such               maps are now available tracing the large-scale global magnetic                  fields from the photosphere, through the chromosphere, and into the             corona.  When stacked in time-series, such maps reveal large-scale              patters of convergence, divergence and shear of the fields.                     Second, the locations of these CMEs will be compared with white                 light synoptic maps and daily coronagraphic images to determine the             relationship of CMEs to preexisting coronal streamers.  This                    project will enhance our understanding of the physics of solar                  activity, especially CMEs, of the structure and evolution of the                corona, and or the propagation of large-scale disturbances through              the heliosphere.",
