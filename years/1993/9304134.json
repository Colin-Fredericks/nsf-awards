 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal focuses on the enzymatic synthesis of methyl                      chloride.  Methyl chloride transferase, an enzyme which has been                recently discovered in Dr. Hager's laboratory, catalyzes the                    synthesis of methyl chloride from S-adenosylmethionine and chloride             ion.  Methyl chloride is the most abundant halohydrocarbon in the               upper atmosphere and thus becomes a potential candidate for                     destruction of the ozone layer.  The annual global emission rate of             methyl chloride from biological sources is estimated to be 5x106                tons.  However, there is scientific disagreement concerning the                 role of naturally occurring halometabolites and man-made chloro-                fluoro hydrocarbons (CFCs) in terms of ozone destruction.                       %%%                                                                             Methyl chloride transferase in marine algae and halophytic plants               may be a mechanism for the injection of massive amounts of methyl               chloride into the atmosphere.  For example, ice plant grows                     abundantly on a world-wide basis in temperate coastal regions, thus             can be a major contributor to atmospheric methyl chloride.  The                 enzyme may also play a role in salt tolerance of plants.                        Transformation of soy bean with the gene for the enzyme may lead to             the development of salt tolerant plants.",
