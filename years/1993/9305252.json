 "awd_abstract_narration": "Paleoflood hydrology is a technique that combines elements of                   geology and surface water hydrology to reconstruct magnitude-                   frequency characteristics of floods that occurred prior to direct               measurement or systematic observation.  Slackwater deposit-                     paleostage indicator (SWD-PSI) paleoflood studies use specific                  evidence of flooding to define paleoflood levels in stable                      (bedrock-controlled) channel environments and use hydraulic                     modeling and geochronological methods to reconstruct the magnitude              and frequency of individual flood events.  Regional SWD-PSI studies             provide data that are indispensable in relating spatial and                     temporal variations in flood frequency to global-scale variations               in climatic conditions over long time period (1000s of years).  We              are proposing to establish a systematic method for incorporating                paleoflood data into a hydroclimatological context to aid in                    understanding fundamental linkages between global climate and                   regional flood frequency.  This method will rely on detailed                    analysis of observed hydroclimatic data sets to develop a scale-                sensitive, circulation-based conceptual framework for use in                    assessing hydroclimatic variability over time scales represented by             paleoflood records.  In the course of development, we plan to use               this method to address the flood-climate linkage in areas                       particularly sensitive to climatic variations.  The methods will                also be used in a continuation of research on the relationship                  between the regional paleoflood characteristics of Arizona and                  global climatic variations over the past 5000 years.  Our work in               southern Arizona will focus on small drainage basins(<25km2) to                 augment previous studies in the region that have focused on                     considerably larger basins subject to flooding from different                   hydroclimatologic mechanisms.  The results of our proposed research             will offer important new insights into the response of extreme                  events to climatic variation and may have important implications                for future changes in global climate.",
