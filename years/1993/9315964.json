 "awd_abstract_narration": "Its  9300638       The research supported by this award falls into three  related areas in the mathematical theory of nonlinear integrable    equations, that is equations which admit a Lax-pair  representation. The work derives from the first use of inverse  scattering methods in solving nonlinear equations and has evolved   into an important branch of mathematical physics. The analytic  aspects of inverse scattering include a wide range of problems      arising in the study of the solutions of integrable equations.  For example, a large class of explicit quasiperiodical  finite-gap solutions, as well as the comprehensive description of  the long-time behavior of the solution of the Cauchy problem for  an integrable system, can be obtained by inverse scattering.   This project focuses on the application of the Riemann-Hilbert  problem technique to the asymptotic analysis of the correlation  functions of the quantum exactly solvable models.  Continuing  work will also be done on the development of the isomonodromy  technique for the investigation of the Painleve-type ordinary  differential equations and their application to the matrix model  of 2D quantum gravity. A third line of investigation will be  concerned with boundary value problems of integrable equations  within the framework of the finite-gap integration and  Riemann-Hilbert problem approach.       Differential equations form a basis for mathematical  modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical  analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to  provide qualitative and quantitative information about the  solutions.  This may include answers to questions about  uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often  develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on  the accuracy of these approximations. The work represented in  this project has close relationships with theoretical physics as  well as the traditional synergisms with studies of wave phenomena  ***",
