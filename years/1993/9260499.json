 "awd_abstract_narration": "Picosecond optical pulses have many scientific and                              instrumentation applications, such as lifetime measurements in                  chemistry, biology, and physics, optical probing of integrated                  circuits, testing of photodiodes and optoelectronic components,                 optical time domain reflectometry, etc.  Currently, Q-switched                  lasers are limited by their energy storage (upper-state lifetime)               to sub-Megahertz repetition rates and pulse widths on the order                 of a nanosecond.  Mode-locked lasers generate picosecond and                    femtosecond pulses, but are normally limited to pulse rates above               approximately 75 MHz because their cavity length becomes                        prohibitively long (greater than 2 meters) for lower pulse                      repetition rates.  We propose to develop integrated fiber lasers                with repetition rates in the range of 1- to 100-MHz for                         instrumentation and measurement applications, which benefit from                these intermediate-range pulse rates.  Such a laser would be very               compact and require no user adjustments to optimize performance.                Diodepumping of the laser provides high efficiency and long                     operating lifetime.  By changing the length of the fiber cavity                 and the repetition rate to the modulator, the repetition rate                   could be easily changed.  Adding a fiber amplifier at the output                easily allows for higher average power where required.  Solition                pulse-shaping effects could be used to generate enhanced                        monomers.  In Phase II, X(2) FLC polymers will be synthesized,                  characterized, and incorporated into a frequency doubling device                containing a near-infrared diode laser or other device identified               during Phase I.",
