 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks to enhance the scientific skills of                         middle school science teachers in New York City.  In                            cooperation with New York Community School Districts 5, 8,                      9, 11, 29, and 32 the City College of New York CUNY proposes                    the Aerospace Space Leadership Institute.  The program is                       for three years and focuses on the training of 48 certified                     middle school science teachers (grades 5-8) to become peer                      leaders in their districts.  Using resources from Learning                      Link, the NASA Resource Center at City College, the Intrepid                    Air and Space Museum, and the Young Astronaut Program, the                      college will provide participants with content, technology,                     and leadership skills which will enable them to become                          effective educators of teachers equipped to help their                          colleagues integrate science and technology in their                            classrooms.  Opportunities will be provided for the                             development of aerospace science and interdisciplinary                          curriculum projects that will be shared on the Learning Link                    electronic network.                                                                                                                                             Cost sharing is equivalent to 37% of the NSF award.",
