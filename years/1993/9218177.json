 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collection of vertebrate fossils (VF) at the                           Denver Museum of Natural History (DMNH) is an important                         resource for research on the history of life in the                             Western Interior region.  There are approximately                               37,000 specimens in the collection, including 52                                holotypes and a number of scientifically important                              assemblages from the Cenozoic and Mesozoic.  Highlights                         include fossil dinosaur and mammal skeletons, the                               original Folsom Bison and Dent mammoth remains from                             early human sites in North America, Oligocene and                               Miocene collections from the Great Plains, and growing                          Jurassic, Paleogene, and Pleistocene collections.  Most                         of the collection was amassed prior to 1947, but field                          work over the past three years has added about 5,500                            specimens.                                                                           In 1989, the Department of Earth Sciences (DES) at                         DMNH began efforts to improve the condition of the                              collection and increase its availability for scientific                         research.  In the past three years, part of the                                 collection has been placed in new steel cabinets, 5,000                         new specimens have been cataloged, and approximately                            3,000 specimens have been entered into a computerized                           data base.  In addition, DMNH has purchased new                                 research and collection management equipment and                                supplies, increased the number of permanent staff                               dedicated to paleontology from 0.33 FTE in 1988 to 4.25                         FTE, constructed a new laboratory, and more than                                doubled the storage space for the VF collections.                                    Although recent DMNH support has improved the                              condition of the collections considerably,                                      approximately three-fourths remain in poor condition.                           The bulk of the older collections have not been                                 properly curated.  Approximately 80% of them have never                         been cataloged or inventoried and 70% are housed in                             overcrowded conditions within wooden cabinetry or                               unstable steel shelving.  Almost all of the older                               collections still have original field labels and                                miscellaneous notes associated with them.  Although                             most of the collection has been prepared, many                                  specimens are broken and in need of repair and                                  conservation.                                                                        This DMNH project will catalog, computerize and                            restore the older collections to make them more                                 available for research and allow for continued growth.                          Primary needs are for space efficient cabinets and                              compactors, computer hardware, an hand-operated                                 forklift, and additional personnel to curate and                                computerize specimens over two years to bring the                               entire vertebrate fossil collection up to modern                                standards.",
