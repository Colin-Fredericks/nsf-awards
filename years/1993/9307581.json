 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves collaboration between an experimentalist at               Case Western University and a theorist at Iowa State University.                The research involves the use of high sensitivity equilibrium                   torque measurements of high-Tc materials.  The theoretical goal of              the project is to determine how the behavior of the torque in such              materials is influenced by thermal fluctuations.  The experimental              thrust is focused on three areas:  the flux-lattice melting                     transition in yttrium-barium-copper-oxide materials, the magnetic               field dependence of this transition, and the determination of the               symmetry of the superconducting ground state in this material.                  These results should lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior             of high-Tc materials in a magnetic field.                                       %%%                                                                             High temperature superconductors are being widely studied, in part              because of their potential for carrying large electrical currents               without the energy losses found in ordinary conductors such as                  copper and aluminum.  However, the very large currents in the                   superconductors generate very large magnetic fields which react                 back on the superconductors and eventually destroy the                          superconducting state.  Thus the behavior of superconductors in                 magnetic fields is a fundamental issue in high-Tc materials                     research.  This project involves both a theorist and                            experimentalist in an effective collaboration which is focused on               studying the forces experience by a superconductor in a magnetic                field.  This magnetic torque measurement apparatus is unique in the             US and is providing important fundamental information that is also              useful in technological applications.",
