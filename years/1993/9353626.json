Important issues in technical                          education such as accreditation, voluntary industry standards,                  who the technicians are and how they should be recruited, how                   they should be educated, the needs of industry for technicians,                 how the curriculum evolves, and how the faculty who teach in                    such programs are educated both in preservice and inservice                     programs are being addressed. Recommendations are being                         developed for government agencies, employers, and educators.***//",
