The Monticello Electronic Library, as the SURA  project is named, will use complementary collection strategies  for electronic materials among participating SURA libraries and  SURAnet electronic document collection many times larger than any  single institution, even Harvard, could support.       Through the services of a group of experts in the SURA  region, and drawing on expertise from others to give a critical  national perspective, a set of proposals is being generated,  discussed and evaluated that will form the basis for the  Monticello Electronic Library.       A meeting of the group of experts together with other  representatives from SURA institutions, SOLINET, and SURAnet will  be held so that advocates for each proposal will give  presentations to this larger audience and discussion will follow.   It is expected that through this planning process, an exciting  but realistic set of proposals will emerge.  These proposals will  be incorporated into a report that outlines the Monticello  Library.  ***",
