 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307914  Whitaker       The investigator develops accurate methods for modeling the  interface between fluids of different viscosities, based on  volume fractions.  The methods are developed with the goal of  handling harder problems such as fluid flow around an obstacle.   Also, statistical equilibrium theories of coherent structures in  turbulence are explored using numerical methods.  The approach  used here is based on maximizing an entropy subject to the  conserved quantities of the flow.  This formulation is based on  the Euler's equations.  The investigator has also recently  developed a model of DNA which will be compared to actual DNA in  nature.  This model will be used to answer some conjectures about  DNA.       The investigator develops accurate methods for  solving equations describing the evolution of an interface  between two different fluids.  This type of interface occurs, for  example, in secondary oil recovery where water is used to expel  remaining oil. The stability of the interface between the water  and oil is important for efficient recovery of the oil.  In  addition, some simplified models of fluid flow are developed and  solved to investigate some fundamental properties of turbulence.   The fluid could be air around an airplane wing.  This research  focuses on predicting coherent structures.  The investigator has  also recently developed a model of DNA which will be compared to  data from actual DNA in nature.  This model will be used to  address some conjectures about DNA which are of fundamental  importance.  ***",
