The design of this proposal is two-  fold: a) to promote active learning by the students through  individualized and small group investigation and b) to provide  instrumentation enabling students to study several fundamental  exercise physiology principles that cannot be investigated with  the current equipment. The primary instruments in this request,  a metabolic measurement system with several available options,  and five networked personal computer work stations, will  facilitate more active learning by students as compared to  traditional presentations in exercise physiology laboratories.  The configuration of the peripheral work stations will provide  for a \"hands-on\" approach to understanding exercise physiology  by allowing for the observation and investigation of laboratory  problems by an individual or small groups of students either in  scheduled laboratories or out-of-class projects. Also, the  metabolic measurement system will provide experiences for our  students not normally examined in an undergraduate laboratory  but integral to the study of exercise physiology. Specifically,  students will be able to test the effects of exercise on  myocardial function and arterial oxygen saturation as well as  investigate real-time changes in energy metabolism as exercise  intensity is varied. Furthermore, sensitivity and precision of  metabolic measurements will be improved from the present  system. The enhancements in the laboratory will foster a direct  problem-solving approach to the learning process and be  reflected in the students' increased comprehension of  scientific principles, concepts, and methods.  ***",
