 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will demonstrate the use of video lab exercises as                 part of a complete program of microcomputer-based laboratory                    physics instruction. Recent technological developments which                    allow live video to be captured directly on standard computer                   memory will be exploited to eliminate the need for laser video                  discs. This should prove to be a very cost-effective method for                 creating and storing new physics video experiments. A Local                     Area Network composed of twelve Macintosh IIvx student                          workstations and two Macintosh Quadra video capture stations                    will be assembled. Each workstation will be interfaced with                     appropriate sensors and probes, allowing data acquisition and                   analysis as well as video playback and editing. Students will                   perform selected video experiments in addition to more standard                 laboratory work. Physics and pre-Engineering students will                      design, shoot and analyze their own video lab experiments.                      Students in all courses will produce electronic lab reports--                   audio/video clips stored in computer memory together with text                  and graphics detailing their analyses. Along with their video                   work, students will employ spreadsheets in analyzing data from                  experiments modelled on those developed under previous NSF- and                 FIPSE-sponsored work -- notably Workshop Physics and Tools for                  Scientific Thinking. The focus will be on active involvement of                 students and conceptual development based on hands-on                           experience.",
