 "awd_abstract_narration": "When and how often are congressional statutes reviewed and decided              in court?  Although the U.S. judiciary was designed to exercise no              policymaking role, numerous cas studies and historical analyses                 make clear that at least since the 1960s and 1970s, the courts have             been intervening with significant impact in both social policies                and regulatory issues.  Because so little systematic research has               been done in this critically important area, this doctoral                      dissertation research project promises to enhance our understanding             of the topic.                                                                                                                                                   A number of competing arguments as to why congressional statutes                land in the courts for review have been offered up.  The failure of             Congress to sufficiently define, specify, clarify, and resolve                  potential issues of conflict and dispute in public laws for                     implementation purposes will be the particular focus of this                    research.  Other arguments will be assessed as well, including                  issue complexity, implementation failure, interest group                        opportunism, public litigiousness, and judicial activism.                                                                                                       Using quantitative methods, including maximum likelihood                        techniques, this study reviews the statutes produced by Congress in             the post-World War II era and traces subsequent court action on                 those same statutes.  Specifically, focusing on a randomly selected             sample of statutes signed into law from 1949 to the mid-1980s, this             project will 1) examine the nature of the statutes themselves; 2)               track how many of these statutes are challenged in which courts; 3)             identify what factors appear to determine whether or not and to                 what extent any particular statute is subject to court review; and,             4) analyze change in the nature of statutes and in the factors that             appear to have pushed some statutes into the courts for review                  across the thirty six year period under investigation.",
