 "awd_abstract_narration": "This facilities project at the Hopkins Marine Station,                          Stanford University, involves the construction of a                             versatile sea water laboratory/culture facility.  The                           project is motivated by the recognition that marine                             organisms provide unique model systems for biomedical,                          ecological, and evolution research and the importance of                        these systems is continually expanding.  The laboratory will                    be an enclosed structure suitable for culturing marine                          specimens, maintaining cloned species, containing transgenic                    organisms, and for conduction experiments under controlled                      conditions.  The building is single storied with a 50X40 ft.                    footprint and it is sited adjacent to existing seawater                         delivery and outlet         pipes.  It will be of masonry                       construction with tile roof and cement slab floor.  The                         interior space is divided into two rooms by a central wall                      and connecting doors.  The interior design is very flexible                     in order to accommodate new experiments or containment needs                    as they arise.  Special equipment such as water chillers,                       sterilization equipment, tank racks, video monitoring will                      be the responsibility of the individual laboratories using                      the flexible space.  The new laboratory/culture facility                        will enhance         the current research program at the                        Hopkins Marine Station and open exciting new research                           opportunities.",
