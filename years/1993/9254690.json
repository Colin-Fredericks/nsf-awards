 "awd_abstract_narration": "NEON, Inc. a not-for-propfit corporation, proposes a                       television series for children, initiallyu 30 programs,                         suitable for daily or weekly broadcast, for home viewing via                    PBSA (with appropriate availability elsewhere). Program                         length:  30 Minutes.                                                                                                                                                 The premise: Three Wufniks--creatures from the cartoom                     world--draw their way into our world and with the help of                       children, undertake the adventure of finding our what it's all                  about.  Thesek characters (played by adult professional                         performers in structurally sophisticated fantasy/animal                         costumes), move from dthe uncertain world of animated film                      into a range of encounters with ourrock-solid environment, get                  to know children and adults, scientists and laypeople, and                      must continually reconstruct their naive theories and their                     image of life on earth.                                                                                                                                              The concept, designed to appeal to five- to nine-olds,                     combines education with entertainment (and is inclusive of                      other age groups, such as parents, to enhance educational                       effect).  School and other non-broadcast distribution of                        program elements is planned, plus ancillary materials                           including computer software and print.                                                                                                                               The educational approach is interdisciplinary, with                        emphasis both on content and the development of positive                        attitudes towards science and mathematics; sub-objectives                       geography and history.  The Principal Investigators are a                       television producer experienced in science programming for                      children, and a scientist with extensive children's                             educational television background.                                                                                                                                   Program appeal for girls and minorities is integarl to                     the design; project staff will also cover a broad spectrum.                     Encouragement of science-and math-related audience activities                   is a project objective.  Planning includesds extensive                          outreach and promotion related to the show premise.",
