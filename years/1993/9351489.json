 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapidly expanding field of computational chemistry is being                 introduced across the four year curriculum in the chemistry                     department.  Molecular modeling is being presented through a                    series of studies performed in the laboratory setting and is                    being related directly to results obtained from laboratory                      experiments.  The project focusses on four courses taken by                     virtually all of the chemistry and biochemistry majors:                         general, organic, biochemistry, and physical chemistry.                         Through hands-on experience in a laboratory environment,                        students are developing a progressively more sophisticated                      understanding of the power (and limitations) of molecular                       modeling in explaining observable chemical and physical                         properties of molecules.  Calculations are being performed with                 a state of the art computational software package, the CAChe                    System, run on a powerful and user-friendly microcomputer,                      Apple's Centris 650 8MB.  In addition, the department's current                 access to a Cray YMP-8 supercomputer is being enhanced through                  a Silicon Graphics workstation so that it is being used for                     instruction in high level quantum mechanical calculations.                      Concepts previously conveyed only verbally now are being                        presented through sophisticated interactive graphical displays;                 displays which not only permit, but actually encourage, the                     manipulation of 3-dimensional structures in real-time. Further                  benefits include the availability of the microcomputers for                     data acquisition, calculations, and the production of                           publication-quality reports.",
