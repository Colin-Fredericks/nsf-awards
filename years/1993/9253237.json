 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. James Bower is a biologist on the faculty of the                            California Institute of Technology, and an active proponent                     of inquiry-based hands-on science education.  Dr. Bower has                     designed a project that will an NSF-supported elementary                        teacher enhancement effort in the Pasadena Unified School                       District (PUSD) to the middle school level.  Project SEED                       (Science for Early Educational Development) is being                            supported by a four-year award from the Teacher Enhancement                     Program to establish a hands on inquiry-based instructional                     program in all of the 22 elementary schools in PUSD.  The                       students entering middle school are encountering a                              traditional textbook/lecture format in science class, and                       parents have begun to demand expansion of the outstanding                       elementary school instruction to the upper grades (3,500                        students in 5 middle schools).  This project will train                         teachers in the use of hands on science kits, establish a                       materials support system for refurbishment of kits, engage                      scientists from the community in teacher workshops and in                       classroom activities, and encourage integration of science                      with other curricular subjects through additional summer                        workshops.                                                                                                                                                      This project will create a comprehensive and integrated K-8                     science curriculum for the public schools in Pasadena, and                      will prepare all middle school teachers responsible for                         science instruction to deliver exemplary learning                               experiences.  The collaboration between Cal Tech and the                        Pasadena Unified School District has been a productive                          partnership, and the expansion of the project from                              elementary to middle schools is a model for other districts                     to follow.                                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing by the University and school district                              represents 104% of the NSF contribution.",
