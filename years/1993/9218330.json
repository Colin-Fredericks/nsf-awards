 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in ecology between Doyle B. McKey, University of Miami, and                     Finn Kjellberg, at the Center for Ecology and Evolutionary                      Ecology, Montpellier, France.  The objective is to study                        interactions in one of the classic cases of insect-plant coevolution:           figs and pollinating wasps. For fig/wasp mutualism to persist, the              pollinator wasps require flowering trees year-round as in tropical              environments. The investigators address fig/wasp mutualism in                   potentially destabilizing seasonal environments as in more                      northern, subtropical climes found in Florida and mediterranean                 France.  They will conduct parallel experiments to characterize                 wasp response to phenology, receptivity of individual figs and                  wasp behavior and chemical attraction to figs.                                                                                                                  The collaborative arrangements enable the investigators to pool                 complementary expertise and obtain comparable results.  Both                    Miami and Montpellier are ideal locations to investigate the                    responses of fig/wasp mutualism to seasonal constraints.                        Because fig/wasp mutualism is a model system for studying many                  questions about co-evolution, the results from this study will                  make a major contribution to co-evolutionary studies in general.",
