This intron,  IVS1 CB1 is derived from the T cell receptor-B (TCR-B) gene.  Our  published investigations suggest that IVS1 CB1 may employ at least  two different mechanisms to escape the degradation pathway that  other known mammalian introns follow: i) IVS1 CB1 may be  inefficiently debranched, thus preventing exonuclease attack; @)  IVS1 CB1 may reside in a protective microenvironment in the  nucleus, such as in the splicesome itself.  Our preliminary studies  also suggest that this stable intron may perform a function.   Indirect evidence suggests that the presence of IVS1 CB1 inhibits  the disassembly of the splicesome following the splicing reactions.  The specific aims of this project are:  1) To determine the  location of spliced IVS1 CB1 transcripts within the nucleus.  This  aim is important because it will provide clues as to how this  intron escapes degradation. It may also help reveal how IVS1 CB1  can impede the transport of mature TCR-B transcripts out of the  nucleus. In situ hybridization will be used to localize IVS1 CB1    within the nucleus.  Cofraction experiments will be performed to  investigate the relationship of IVS1 CB1 and splicesomal components  in vivo and vitro.  2) To determine if IVS1 CB1 lariats perform a  regulatory function.  In particular, it will be investigated  whether the presence of IVS1CB1 inhibits the transport of fully  spliced transcripts our of the nucleus.  For this study,  transfection experiments will be performed in mammalian cell lines.  It will be assessed if the rate of nuclear -to-cytoplasmic  transport and/or some other post-transcriptional event is affected  by this intron.  It will be determined if IVS1 CB1 and/or adjacent  exon sequences are responsible for the post-transcriptional  regulation.  It will also be examined if this intron can confer  this regulation to heterologous transcripts in cis.  %%%  The maj ority of higher eukaryotic genes are interrupted by non-  coding segments termed introns.  These introns are excised from  precursor RNAs in the form of lariat structures by the process of  RNA splicing.  Introns have been an enigma since their original  discovery in the late 1970's.  The fate of introns after their  excision from precursor RNAs is not well understood.  It is not  clear if mammalian introns posses function capabilities.  We intend  to explore these issues by studying an unusual intron that remains  stable after it is spliced our of nuclear transcripts.  This  intron, IVS1 CB1, is derived from precursor transcripts encoding  the T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen.  We will investigate whether  IVS1CB1 functions to control the expression of TCR protein in T  cells.  Another issue that has not been resolved in the RNA  splicing field is the precise mechanism by which introns are  spliced out of precursor transcripts.  An impediment to research on  this topic is the lack of systems to study intermediate stages of  the splicing in vivo.  Our studies suggest that the presence of  IVS1CB1 inhibits the disassembly of the splicesome following  splicing in vivo.  Thus, IVS1CB1 may be useful tool to study  intermediate stages of RNA splicing in intact cells.",
