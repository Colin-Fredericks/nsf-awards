The symposium \"Pollination                                  Biology in the Tropics\" would review recent                                     advances and bring together scientists working                                  on various aspects of pollination.  specific                                    attention is to be paid to conservation and                                     management of pollinator populations and to                                     problems in the pollination of tropical crops.                                  The following sessions will be held: flower                                     biology in reaction to pollination; insect                                      behavior in relation to pollination;                                            pollination by insects and other animals in                                     natural communities; insect pollination in                                      commercial production of seeds and fruits;                                      pollination problems in tropical crops;                                         conservation and management of pollinating                                      insects; and population dynamics of                                             pollinators.  Participation is expected from                                    countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia,                                        Europe, and the U.S.  A book covering extended                                  abstracts of the presentation will be available                                 in the meeting.
