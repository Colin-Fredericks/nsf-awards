 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Brooklyn Children's Museum and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden             aim to cooperatively and cost-effectively develop, evaluate, and                produce three permanent exhibits (2600 sf at BCM, 1200 sf at BBG,               and a 3600 sf outdoor Discovery Garden at BBG) and two copies of an             800 sf traveling exhibit in a project called Breaking Ground:                   Plants and People.  When complete in 1996, these exhibits will                  teach 1.5 million annual public visitors about basics in botany,                ethnobotany, and urban to ecology, promote an understanding of                  plants' importance to human life, and foster positive environmental             ethics among children 6-12 years old.                                                                                                                                This project is important because collaboration with                       professional botanists will teach a leading children's museum how               to effectively present in-depth science content, and allow a major              public garden to experiment with interactive exhibits in a natural              setting.  Joint promotions using NSF-funded program materials will              encourage children in culturally and economically diverse areas                 around New York City to return again and again to two important                 community resources for informal science education.  This strategy              will reinforce learning and promote lifelong appreciation for                   experiential exhibits in botanical gardens and for a meaningful                 depth of science in children's museums.",
