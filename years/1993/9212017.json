 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project analyzes the management of Utah Highway 210 with                   respect to avalanche danger.  The occurrence of an avalanche                    crossing the road is a low-probability, high-risk event.                        Avalanche hazard is managed both by active control (explosives)                 and by passive control (road closures).  The study emphasizes the               road closure decision.  The probability of an avalanche crossing                the road is modeled through logistic regression.  The decision to               close the road, however, reflects a highly asymmetric loss                      function.  Closing the road when no avalanche occurs is very                    costly, but does not compare to the effects of failing to close                 the road when an avalanche does in fact occur.  This feature of                 the problem is incorporated into the analysis using an asymmetric               loss function. Decisions to close the road are scored against                   actual avalanche occurrence by means of a proper scoring rule and               this performance is contrasted with that of professional                        avalanche forecasters currently managing the road.  The                         possibility of augmenting the current practice with statistical                 analysis is evaluated.  The results of the project are                          generalized to other decision making problems involving quantal                 forecasting under asymmetric loss. Asymmetric loss is a common                  problem with low-probability, high risk events.",
