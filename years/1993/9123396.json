 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agrarian transformation receives considerable attention in                 the literature on social and economic change in the developing                  nations of the world.  Socio-economic differentiation of the                    peasantry is poorly understood at the household or village level,               particularly with respect to household strategies of petty                      enterprise and labor mobility.  This project will investigate                   social and economic differentiation of the peasantry in the                     context of the Indonesian Transmigration program.  Under this                   program, poor, landless households in Java and Bali are recruited               to move to the outer islands to new settlements where they                      receive land, allowances and training in agriculture.  This                     attempt to cope with population growth and deforestation of the                 inner islands is seen by other nations as a possible solution to                problems of overpopulation and its associated problems.  Little                 is known about the impact of this resettlement scheme on the                    transmigrants, particularly their economic behavior and its                     effect on the household.  This pilot project will employ surveys,               in-depth interviews, and focus groups to examine the process of                 socio-economic differentiation at the regional and household                    level in selected areas involved in the transmigration program in               Indonesia.                                                                           Traditional agriculture continues to dominate the peasant                  economies of most developing parts of the world.  In many areas,                economic development has contributed to the commercialization of                rural economies, leading to profound social and economic changes                which threaten the viability of peasant economies.  This project                will provide new knowledge about how differentiation proceeds as                a result of government sponsored migration.  It will also refine                a methodology for doing research in newly settled areas which are               undergoing rapid socio-economic change.  The results of this                    research will inform not only theory but also policy regarding an               important regional development strategy.",
