 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support an international conference on primordial               immune mechanisms.  Host defense mechanisms have been evolving                  since the first organisms encountered one another hundreds of                   millions of years ago.  All multi-cellular organisms face the                   necessity of distinguishing between their own cells and tissues and             foreign cells and materials in order to deal with such problems as              parasites and pathogens.  Primitive species are capable of                      recognition and defense as are the vertebrates, and, thus, lessons              learned from them can provide a basis for understanding strategies              that vertebrate animals have adopted.  Studies of defense systems               of primitive animals are yielding new insights into the diverse                 host defense functions characteristic of all living things.  In                 addition, invertebrates offer new sources of products and potential             therapeutic agents.                                                             %%%                                                                             Much research has been carried out on immune function in higher                 mammals as a model for the human immune response.  In contrast,                 very little is know about immune-like function in the array of                  other species living on Earth.  Understanding how a wide range of               animals defend themselves can provide us with rational strategies               to help preserve the diversity of life.  Recent advances using                  techniques of molecular biology and protein chemistry are being                 applied in identification of products used in self defense and                  characterization of immune-like responses in a wide array of                    organisms.  This international conference will bring speakers from              diverse fields and from around the world to share information and               insights into the origins and function of host defense systems.  An             international conference focusing on this subject at this time will             contribute to progress in this important area.",
