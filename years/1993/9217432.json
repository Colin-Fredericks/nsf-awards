 "awd_abstract_narration": "9217432  Young    This award will support collaborative research  between Michal Young, Purdue University, and Mauro  Pezze, Politechnico di Milano, Italy.  The project  will investigate integration of multiple operational  models of concurrent software.    Research issues for the project include methods for  reasoning about the relation between different  behavioral models of the same component; techniques  for analyzing the behavior of systems in which  components may be modeled in different ways;  automatic generation of state-space analysis tools  with support for multi-formalism analysis; and  models of time amenable to practical state-space  analysis.  The Italian investigator will contribute  expertise in Petri net models of concurrent systems.   The US investigator will bring expertise in the  analysis of concurrent software and the integration  of analysis techniques and tools in software  development environments.  Pezze will take the lead  in the more theoretical side of the work, and Young  will lead in the design and evaluation of the  analysis tool generator.  ***",
