 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313857  Abdel-Wahab       Traditionally the Internet has been used for asynchronous  collaboration mostly using email, remote login and file transfer.   Recently we have seen the emergence of computer conferencing as a  new Internet application to allow synchronous collaboration among  geographically diverse users working together as a team on common  projects.  A process that once would have taken days, with  documents being sent back and forth between users, now can be  completed in a few minutes which increases the productivity and  helps in making decisions quicker.       At this time there is no standard protocol and mechanism  that allows computer conferences to register and advertise about  themselves.  Therefore users have to depend on personal  communications and other indirect methods to find out and locate  ongoing conferences so that they can join and participate.         In this project a system called Universal Conference  Information Server (UCIS) will be designed and implemented to  solve this problem.  This implementation of UCIS will stimulate  further research in this area and can be used as a basis for  defining and ultimately the adoption of a standard Internet  protocol for  computer-based conferencing.       The system has three major components: Announcers, Servers,  and Queriers.  Announcers send conference information to Servers,  while Queriers retrieve conference information stored at the  Servers.  Like most Internet service, UCIS will offer its  services in both TCP and UDP forms.  We will define the necessary  protocols used by all three components and provide sample  implementation which can be used as a model by computer  conference system builders.  The system is designed to be  scalable to handle the expected growth in this form of  synchronous collaboration and to provide reliable, accurate, and  fast access to any number of users anywhere in the Internet.  ***",
