College  teachers in the biological sciences need preparation to enable  them to consider these controversial ethical and policy  questions, that face them directly, and that face society  generally.  This six-day intensive summer program will include  approximately 15 participants from academic centers in the 100  mile region surrounding Washington DC.  Course content will be  broad, well-balanced, and will include opposing viewpoints.   Visits to the surrounding institutions before the workshop will  identify a biology faculty consultant who will work with the  course directors to assure its relevance and sensitivity to the  needs of faculty participants, and will stimulate faculty  interest in the course.  Post-course visits will assess progress  in achieving the course goals of stimulating curriculum change to  include discussion of ethical and policy issues involving animal  use.  Planning for further workshops will depend on and  incorporate results from this pilot effort.  ***",
