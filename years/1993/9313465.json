The  Chemistry department,  is located in a building that consist of  two wings,  Clark and Riebsomer, constructed in 1953 and 1968  respectively.  The University renovated the Clark wing last year,  and requests funds to renovate the research space in the  Riebsomer wing.  Riebsomer is primarily a graduate research  building that houses research laboratories and the departmental X-  ray and NMR facilities.  Research activities conducted in the  facility encompasses the four divisions of chemistry: analytical,  inorganic, organic and physical, in addition to the  interdisciplinary areas of biorelated chemistry and material  science.  Major problems have developed over the years in the  safe operation of HVAC, ventilation and cooling systems.  As  currently configured, the HVAC and the fume hood systems cannot  handle the makeup and exhaust air loads.  Because of the  imbalances in the air flow, the system mixes the air in the  building and promotes cross contamination, creating an unsafe  environment.  Renovations to the Riebsomer wing will include an  extensive replacement of the HVAC mechanicals,  ductwork,  and  the installation of new fume hoods and a variable air volume  supply.  Successful completion of this project will provide  researchers and students with safe conditions to work and will  increase the efficiency of a productive group.  ***",
