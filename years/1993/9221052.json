 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being conducted by Dr. David M. Hillis, a                 molecular biologist from the University of Texas.  Dr. Hillis is                well known for his studies relating to DNA sequence analysis.  The              current research is a natural extension of Dr. Hillis' past work                and represents a major innovation, linking the utilization of                   parallel computers with a need for the development of more                      efficient software for analyzing the increasing amount of                       nucleotide sequence data.  Software for DNA sequence analysis is                being modified and developed for massively parallel computers in an             effort to increase computation speed and enhance the assessment of              available computer algorithms.  Supercomputer manufacturers are                 currently emphasizing massively parallel architecture, and even                 smaller highly parallel computers are under production and/or                   developed.  The development of software for biological analysis                 will contribute to both the scientific community and the newly                  emerging parallel computer industry.",
