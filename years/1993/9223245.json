 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of the project is to assemble an ethno-historical                     picture of a region in northwestern Borneo that was for centuries               a small but integral part of the Asian world economy.  It is a                  region of remarkable ethnic complexity.  Moreover, communities                  are not fixed features of the social landscape, but have changed                constantly over the last century in response to internal and                    external trade, warfare, and colonial annexation.  This project                 is designed to furnish the missing pieces of an ethnic puzzle                   which is of interest because it allows the researcher to take up                a new issue in an on-going study of the significance of ritual.                 The complexity of communal interrelations over time is matched by               the great diversity of ritual within which similar notions of                   life and death are expressed.  Innovation in ritual is related                  not to deep meanings but to community dynamics.  Leaders can                    utilize to their own political ends, but they can not control its               diversity, which is shaped by larger historical forces.  By                     relating ritual diversity to community dynamics, this project                   sheds fresh light on the relationship between ritual and                        politics.",
