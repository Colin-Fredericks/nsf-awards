 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to conduct piezocone                          penetration tests in the centrifuge on soil samples                             which are prepared to achieve certain strength and                              stiffness profiles. The results of cone penetration                             tests can be compared with the reference soil properties                        which are measured by conventional triaxial testing                             on specimens that are either prepared to the same                               conditions as the centrifuge soil sample, or are obtained by                    coring from the centrifuge sample after the penetration test.                   In addition, since the undrained shear strength of soil is                      not a unique parameter and depends on the type of test used                     to measure it, it will be adopted that the undrained shear                      strength measured by the shear vane will be used as the                         reference in this research. Thus, simultaneously with                           cone penetration tests on a centrifuge sample, the                              undrained shear strength profile of the sample will                             be measured by means of a miniature shear vane, so                              that the profiles of cone penetration resistance and                            of shear strength can be compared directly.",
