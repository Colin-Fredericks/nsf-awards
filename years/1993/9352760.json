Non-science majors  (including many education majors) in a year-long elementary  astronomy sequence are using CCD cameras in observing and  laboratory exercises.  This a dds a much more quantitative  component to the observation-oriented but largely descriptive  astronomy laboratory course.  Science majors in their first  (and often only) physics course, both in the algebra and the  calculus-based sequences, can get laboratory experience with  CCDs and digital image processing.  This is a technology they  are quite likely to encounter in their future careers.  Physics  majors in upper-division courses in optics, experimental  physics, and a required, research-oriented independent study  courses will use the equipment as well.  Research opportunities  in both astronomy and physics increase dramatically in both  spectroscopy and imaging applications.  Laboratories which  incorporate the CCDs are more streamlined, quantitative, and  clear than previously.   The systems are easily transported  between physics laboratories, which are offered during the day,  and astronomy laboratories, which are at night.        ***",
