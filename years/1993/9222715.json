 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic ice edge as a frontal system has different                        implications for different trophic levels.  During summer,                      primary producers and microheterotrophs flourish in the meltwater               lens that is created in the euphotic zone at the retreating ice                 edge.  In contrast, for longer-lived consumer species with                      generation times of a year or more, any enhanced standing stocks                at the ice edge must be the result of immigration to the ice edge               or production in place.  This research will test the hypothesis                 that the summer ice edge bloom acts as a biological magnet to                   concentrate metazoan consumers and as a southward moving                        generator facilitating growth and reproduction in zooplankton                   species.  Research conducted in the Scotia-Weddell Sea region                   during the austral summer will focus on the distribution,                       abundance, and biological activity of zooplankton and micronekton               in the upper 1000m of the water column in the open water,                       marginal ice zone, and pack ice regions of the study area.  The                 physical environment will be described; the extent and activity                 of the ice edge phytoplankton bloom will be mapped using in vivo                fluourescence and estimates of primary production will be made.                 Zooplankton/micronekton community structure will be characterized               using data from an optical plankton sampler, as well as nets and                trawls.  Biological activity of zooplankton will be evaluated                   through studies of metabolic rate, grazing rate, egg production                 rate, diet, and metabolic enzyme activity.  The resultant data                  will describe zooplankton/micronekton community structure, major                trophic relationships, grazing impact, and patterns of energy                   utilization for species living in the study area, showing clearly               the impact of the ice edge bloom on the intermediate trophic                    levels.",
