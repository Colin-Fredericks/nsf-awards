 "awd_abstract_narration": "The notion of term rewriting was conceived in the late sixties                  starting from a seminal paper by Knuth and Bendix.  It later                    evolved into a powerful tool bridging between programming                       languages and logic in computer science.  In addition to                        extensive theoretical results, it has been applied to symbolic                  and algebraic computation, automated deduction, programming                     languages and compiler optimization, termination and                            correctness of programs, grammars, lambda and combinatory                       calculi, and has been the catalyst in the inception of                          constraint solving and unification theory.  In recent years                     studies have also been initiated in using rewriting as a model                  for concurrency, as well as a viable solution to combining                      functional and logic programming paradigms.                                                                                                                     Due to the popularity of the subject, there has been an                         increase in graduate students studying in areas related to                      term rewriting.  This grant is to defray cost of participation                  for about fifteen U.S. computer science graduate students.",
