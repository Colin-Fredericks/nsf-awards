 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some species of animals occur in two different morphologies, a                  phenomenon called polyphenism. Usually the different alternative                morphologies develop in different seasons of the year. In order to              develop a different morphology it is necessary to activate a                    different set of genes, and thus the problem of control of                      polyphenism is to discover the mechanism by which an animal                     \"chooses\" between two alternative gene sets. The aim of the                     proposed research is to develop, for the first time, an                         understanding of complete pathway of genetic control in such a                  seasonal polyphenism. For this research we will use the butterfly,              Precis coenia, which has a dramatic color polyphenism and for which             our preliminary studies have already elucidated portions of the                 control pathway. The proposed research will identify the pigments               responsible for the different color forms and the enzymes                       responsible for their synthesis. The genes for these enzymes will               then be cloned so that we may develop tools to study the mechanism              by which their expression is controlled. We know that a steroid                 hormone, 20-OH-ecdysone, is ultimately responsible for stimulating              the genetic switch that causes the alternative pigment synthesis to             occur, and experiments will be done to begin to investigate how                 this could control the differential expression of enzymes for the               alternative pigments.",
