 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303229  Gordon       Professor Gordon will investigate various questions about  the Dehn surgery construction of 3-manifolds from knots and  links.  In the generic case, the knot or link complement will  have a hyperbolic structure, which persists under most surgeries.   This persistence fails if (and only if, modulo the Geometrization  Conjecture) the resulting 3-manifold contains an essential sphere  or torus, or is Seifert fibred.  This project is to continue a  joint program with Professor John Luecke of understanding and  circumscribing these exceptional surgeries via the combinatorial  analysis of intersections of surfaces.  Results obtained so far  include the Knot Complement Conjecture, the Reducibility  Conjecture, and strong restrictions on the creation of essential  tori.  Specific foci of the project will include the Cabling  Conjecture and the question of when Seifert fibred spaces (both  toroidal and atoroidal) arise.       The general context of the project is the attempt to further  our understanding of 3-manifolds.  A 3-manifold is a \"space\"  which is locally like ordinary 3-dimensional Euclidean space, but  whose global topological structure may be quite complicated.  For  example, our universe is a 3-manifold, whose global structure is  at present unknown.  The problem of describing all 3-manifolds in  a reasonable way is an important one that is still unsolved,  although much progress has been made.  The subject is a rich one,  which draws on a wide range of mathematical techniques, including  some derived from quantum physics.  The main focus of the project  is Dehn surgery, which is a procedure for constructing  3-manifolds from a knot (i.e. a closed loop embedded somehow in  3-dimensional Euclidean space) or, more generally, a link (i.e.  several knots linked together).  Roughly speaking, the knot or  link is removed and \"sewn back\" differently.  Since it turns out  that all 3-manifolds can be constructed in this way, a  sufficiently good understanding of Dehn surgery wou ld have  important implications for the general theory of 3-manifolds.  ***",
