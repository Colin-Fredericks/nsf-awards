 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of biosensors.  The objective of this research is to                   evaluate the feasibility of an improved biosensor electrode which               uses a two enzyme relay that is coupled to a sensing electrode via              a modified polymer-mediator complex.  The overall goal of a                     multiphase SBIR effort is to develop improved amperometric                      biosensors based on electrical communication between horseradish                peroxidase (HRP) and several new polymeric electrode relay                      systems.  The design strategy is to use an electrode modified with              HRP to detect the hydrogen peroxide formed by the selective                     reaction of a substrate with an oxidoreductase enzyme.  Electrical              communication between the HRP and cathode is effected by several                new polymer systems which improve stability and optimize the                    response.  Because the final reaction is cathodic, this type of                 sensor has the advantage of being able to operate at applied                    potentials where the detection of common electroactive                          interferents does not occur.                                                    %%%                                                                             The research plan for this SBIR Phase I project is designed to                  account for traditional problems encountered in the assay of                    blood-based analytes and should determine the feasibility of                    moving forward into a Phase II effort.  If successful, this                     technology has significant commercial potential.",
