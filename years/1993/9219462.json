 "awd_abstract_narration": "Uncertainty in modeling the response of Earth environments to                   changing conditions such as global warming arises from a poor                   understanding of the dynamics of these environments.  It is                     established that over the past 20,000 years the Sahara has                      undergone dramatic swings from more extensive and sand-sea                      development than today to being vegetated with common lakes and                 rivers.  While   these swings correspond to Milankovitch cycles,                our basis for understanding these in a process-response model has               only recently begun to emerge.  The area of the Sahara extending                from the Atlas Mountains onto the Sahara Platform in Tunisia offers             a microcosm of diverse environments, where deposits are housed in               a subsiding trough.  Remote sensing is first used to map present                environments, recognize relict features, and locate specific                    depocenters for detailed field work.  Field work involves the                   establishment of an unconformity-bounded stratigraphic framework                for eolian, fluvial and lacustrine deposits in the area through                 field mapping of soil-geomorphic and stratigraphic relationships,               facies analysis, and geophysical methods.  Subsequent lab analysis              involves the dating of the sequences so they can be correlated with             climatic events.  Because the response of eolian and associated                 depositional systems to climatic and other factors is the basis for             sequence stratigraphy, the results are expected to help formulate               a general process-response eolian sequence  model that will have                predictive capabilities with respect to changing external controls.",
