 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is aimed at diagnosing processes responsible for                low-frequency variations in the general circulation of the                      atmosphere relevant to climate dynamics.                                             The PIs plan to identify the mechanisms that give rise to                  changes in atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) on interannual and                longer time scales.  Newly available data sets will be used to                  examine the surface torques responsible for ENSO anomalies in AAM               and the manner in which the surface sources and sinks of momentum               are linked to behavior in the upper troposphere.  Stationary wave               activity fluxes will be computed to investigate further the way in              which low-frequency variations in tropical angular momentum become              communicated to the extratropics.  Regions responsible for the                  presence of regimes in the AAM time series and in the Hadley                    circulation will be determined using the 30-year archive of zonal               and meridional winds in the General Circulation Data Library.                   Finally, the Pi will update and extend their analysis of the impact             of doubling CO2 on zonal winds and AAM by considering suitable                  experiments with current versions of general circulation models.                     This research is important because it strives to understand                how variations in the earth's angular momentum affects atmospheric              processes on interannual and interdecadal time scales.",
