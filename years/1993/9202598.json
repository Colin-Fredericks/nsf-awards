 "awd_abstract_narration": "Douglas R. Anderson will work on several problems in the                   areas of boundedly controlled topology and its applications.                    Some of the problems are designed to expand the uses of the                     methods of boundedly controlled topology by applying them to                    problems in other areas, while others lie entirely within the                   domain of boundedly controlled topology itself.  Attempts to                    expand the scope of the methods are intended to demonstrate their               relevance and clarify their limitations and may expose additional               questions within the subject which need to be addressed.  The                   problems within the area itself represent extensions of research                already done by Anderson and H. J. Munkholm of Odense, Denmark.                 The objectives are to understand more clearly the exact                         relationship between this part of topology and the versions of                  controlled topology introduced by such other researchers as T. A.               Chapman, S. C. Ferry, and F. S. Quinn, and, if necessary, to                    enlarge the body of foundational results within boundedly                       controlled topology.                                                                 Topology is the study of properties of geometric objects                   which are not destroyed by continuous transformations, such                     properties as connectedness, knottedness, and so forth.                         Topological properties are as basic and ubiquitous as the more                  familiar geometric properties of length and area, but they call                 for entirely different techniques to deal with them.  By now the                topology of high dimensions has been intensively developed, and                 the array of techniques available is quite extensive.  From time                to time in the development of a subject, it becomes necessary to                organize its methods to make them more readily available to                     others and easier to pass on to future generations which will                   wish to use them without having been directly involved in their                 invention.  Such a time has arisen in high dimensional topology,                and the boundedly controlled approach is a natural codifying                    principle that is proving useful in making order in the toolbox,                so to speak.",
