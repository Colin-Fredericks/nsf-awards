The complexity of the pattern of interconnections is remarkable, as is the fidelity with which they are made.  The mechanisms by which the connections of the nervous system are formed is poorly understood.  This project will employ a genetic approach to answer the question of how nerves recognize their appropriate target cells with which to form connections.  The aim of the project is to identify specific mutations that cause the proper pattern of neuronal connections between the eye and the brain not to develop.  The genes and gene products affected by these mutations will be identified.  Biochemical and cellular studies of these gene products will contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms responsible for development of the normal nervous system.  ***                                                                                                M       9311840  Heilig    Development of a complex nervous system requires the establishment of an extraordinary number of connections                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   !         !
