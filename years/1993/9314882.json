The seminar, which will be held June 13 18, 1994 in Kona, Hawaai, is being co organized by Professor John Boyer, College of Marine Studies, University of Delaware, and Dr. Kuni Ishihara, Professor of Crop Science, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan.  The seminar will bring together leading researchers in the field of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, and will treat mechanisms of CO2 acquisition, photosynthesis in high and low temperatures, irradiances, nutrient and water levels, and the partitioning of carbon compounds to various plant parts.  The effects of elevated CO2 on long term photosynthesis and photosynthetic enzymes will be treated, with empahsis on likely aterations in agricultural and natural plant communities.  The goal of the seminar is to integrate new advances in photosynthesis spanning molecular to global issues with an emphasis on extending molcular approahces to environmental and agricultural problems.  Of great importance is the identification of gene products of known function that respond to the environment and that could have significant effects on photosynthetic activity and agriculture under altered environmental conditions.  This knowledge may enable tools of molecular biology to be used to manipula te the responsiveness of plants to changing climates.  This is the third in a series of binational meetings on this topic.  The first was a U.S. Australia meeting in 1986 to discuss the effects of photoinhibition on photosynthesis.  The second was a U.S. Japan seminar in 1988 to discuss the understanding of environmental effects on plants, including the effects of photosynthesis.  The present seminar is a logical extension of these two meetings and it is hoped that the U.S. and Japanese scientists will identify emerging ageas to which new techniques and investigations can be applied with emphasis on increased ability to manipulate the adaption of plants to altered climates.",
