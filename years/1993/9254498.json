 "awd_abstract_narration": "During each of three years, Project PHYSLab will serve 20                       high school physics teachers.  The focus of Project PHYSLab                     is a three-week workshop for 20 teachers to learn and                           experiment with current technology designed to help students                    understand fundamental concepts in nature.  Teachers work                       with Microcomputer Based Laboratory (MBL) interfaces,                           spreadsheets, and a variety of physics related courseware.                      Teachers experiment with motion, force, temperature,                            magnetic field, light, sound and radioactivity probes.                          Computer interfacing experiments include the use of photo-                      gates and \"Smart Pulleys\".  In addition to the assortment of                    instructional hardware, a wide variety of physics-related                       software is used for data analysis.  Graphical analysis,                        equation fitting programs, spreadsheets, simulation                             software, and mathematical programs are all available for                       data analysis, computational instruction, and independent                       study.                                                                                                                                                          Not all PHYSLab experiments require the use of a computer.                      A low-cost digital timer yields excellent data in projectile                    motion, free-fall, sound, and simple harmonic motion                            experiments.  Non-computer laboratory equipment provides                        graphical methods for analyzing two-dimensional collision                       problems.                                                                                                                                                       Innovative laboratory experiments focus on fundamental and                      subtle concepts that students frequently find difficult.                        Many of the experiments are designed to overcome                                misconceptions students bring to the physics classroom.                         Project PHYSLab prepares teachers to help their students                        hypothesize, think, reason, understand, challenge, and                          analyze as they examine fundamental scientific ideas.                                                                                                           Project PHYSLab will prepare well-prepared physics teachers                     to lead workshops for their peers.  Each participating                          teacher will give at least two such workshops during the                        academic year following the summer workshop.  Workshops will                    be held at Catlin Gabel School, Portland, OR and at national                    meetings of the American Association of Physics Teachers.                       Project PHYSLab is dynamic in nature.  The workshop will                        continue into the future using the world-wide Internet for                      an extensive system of follow-up support and interactive                        experiences.  A network of follow-up activities and services                    is in place so that the support for the teacher continues                       well after the formal workshop ends.  This support is                           continuous and immediate.                                                                                                                                       The PI is Lowell Herr of Catlin Gabel School.                                                                                                                   Cost-sharing equals 60% of the NSF award.",
