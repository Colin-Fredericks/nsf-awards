The equipment, comprising CCD cameras with  suitable filters and digitizing and associated computer  equipment, is also being incorporated into use with the on-  campus solar telescope in white light and in hydrogen-alpha.  The eclipse work is in the framework of a study of the cause of  coronal heating, following predictions that surface Alfven  waves would lead to oscillations in coronal loops with periods  of 1-10 s. Earlier versions of this experiment have been  carried out at two eclipses, with extensive student  participation at home and on site, and found indications of  excess power at these periods in our Fourier analysis. There  was an improved version on site for the 1991 total solar  eclipse, with even more extensive student participation, but  cloudy weather prevented observation. There is a complementary  research grant to perform this experiment at the 3 November  1994 eclipse in South America, Observations will be made with  intensified CCD cameras, frame grabbers, and computer  digitizing and recording, instead of the fiber-optics strands  and photomultipliers in the existing experimental setup.   Student participation with the equipment requested here  includes students in the Freshman Seminar and the junior/senior  solar-physics seminar as well as students participating in the  expedition on site. The data and equipment will remain useful  on campus, with the telescopes and in the courses, for years to  follow.  ***",
