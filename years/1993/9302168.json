The program's                                    awards provide opportunities for joint                                          research, and the use of unique or                                              complementary facilities, expertise and                                         experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                                 This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Justin                                       Peatross of the University of Rochester to go                                   to Moscow, Russia to the General Physics                                        Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences to work                                  with Professor M. V. Fedorov.                                                                                                                                   It has recently been discovered that high-order                                 harmonics of laser light can be created when an                                 intense laser interacts with atoms.  The                                        efficiency of generating the higher harmonics                                   relative to the lower ones can be surprisingly                                  high, outside of the range wherein perturbative                                 approximations can be used.  The high harmonics                                 appear when a laser drives atoms so strongly                                    that they are on the verge of ionization.  The                                  problem of understanding high-harmonic                                          generation has two parts:  1) the single-atom                                   response to incident laser light, and 2) the                                    collective behavior of the atoms regarding the                                  matching of the phases of the emitted harmonic                                  light.  The proposed research centers primarily                                 on the single-atom effects responsible for the                                  generation of high harmonics.  An investigation                                 will be made into the relevance of the                                          classical equations of motion of a driven                                       electron trapped in a non-linear potential                                      well.  Other single-atom descriptions of                                        harmonic generation will also be investigated.                                                                                                                  The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months, a dependent allowance and money                                  for lab fees.",
