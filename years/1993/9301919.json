 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interferometrics proposes to conduct a Phase II SBIR                            research effort to implement the design of a portable                           satellite communications terminal that was created                              during Phase I.  The proposed terminal will provide                             autonomous                                                                      digital communications in polar regions using existing store                    and-forward digital packet radio satellite in high                              inclination low Earth orbit.  The principal goal of this                        effort is to demonstrate the use of an ultra-compact                            terminal which would work satisfactorily in the polar                           environment and be useful for both the NSF and commercial                       satellite communications customers.  Our objective is to                        design, construct and evaluate an engineering development                       model that will reduce significantly the size, weight,                          power, and cost of the terminal, while improving its overall                    performance, reliability, and ease of use.                                                                                                                      Key features of the proposed terminal design are:  (1) use                      of an Integrated Communications Processor to eliminate the                      Terminal Node Controller hardware, reduce the terminal's                        power requirement, and permit interconnections to a personal                    computer, GPS receiver, and/or research instrumentation; (2)                    an antenna system optimized for communicating with                              microsatellites and tailored to the local RF environment;                       and (3) integration with an Internet gateway to create an                       autonomous, transparent satellite radio link between                            Internet sites.",
