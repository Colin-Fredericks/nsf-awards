 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353565  Sanford    The Magic School Bus Museum Collaborative, requests through  Discovery Places, Inc., NSF support for six science museums and  Scholastic Productions, Inc., to develop science education  materials that capitalize on the interest and excitement in the  forthcoming Magic School Bus television series and the Magic  School Bus books.  Over a three year period the collaborative  will provide basic science education activities and  demonstrations through museum educational programming.  The  collaborative will provide tools and support for teachers to use  the Magic School Bus themes in their science curriculum and  provide hands-on science classroom experiences using mobile  museum exhibits.  Working with the National Urban League, ASPIRA,  the AAAS Black Church Project, and other youth serving  organizations, the collaborative will encourage multi-ethnic  participation in these museum programs.    The numbers of children and their families who will be reached by  the Magic School Bus Museum Collaborative are significant.  The  components of the project are a planetarium program (100 copies),  two 1200 square feet traveling exhibits, and activity and  programming guide, table-top exhibits and program, and 2 teacher  enhancement workshops.  Collectively, these components can reach  conservatively over 5 million museum visitors in the first year.   Coupled with the new television series, the Magic School Bus can  have a tremendous impact on the education of young people in the  sciences.  ***",
