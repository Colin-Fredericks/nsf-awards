 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will apply the 11129 I system to the study of the origin and                 migration history of brines in the Louisiana Gulf Coast Basin. This             basin consists of a sequence of sedimentary layers ranging in age               from Jurassic to recent.  Generally, there exist three different                flow regimes in this basin, a shallow fresh-water system, and two               deeper systems, one hydropressured, one geopressured, which are                 characterized by fluids with higher concentrations of solutes.                  Although the depositional sequence of the sedimentary formations                in this basin is well undeerstood, the relation of the brines to                their host formations is often not clear.  The geochemical                      characteristics  of iodine combined with the half-life of 129 I                 (15.7 Ma) make this isotope system potentially useful for the                   determination of source ages for fluids and orgainic material in                this basin and, in conjunction with determination of 36 Cl, for the             estimate of residence times of waters in their respective host                  formaiton.  The results of this study will give information on the              age relation between the fluids and their host rocks, on the                    relation between fluids in the different parts of the basin and on              communication between different reservoirs.  Because the presence               of iodine is related to that of organic material the result will                given information on the origin and the age relation of                         hydrocarbons in this basin.  Since this project represents the                  first time that this isotope system is to be used on a regional                 scale in a sedimentary basin, the study will also indicate to what              extent the 129 I system is useful for the investigation of fluid                movement in basins containing organic material.  This has very                  strong implication for understanding basin evolution, oil                       accomulation and formation of sedimentary ores.//",
