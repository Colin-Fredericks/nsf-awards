 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anthropological research from the early 1960s helped educators                  focus their attention on teaching and learning as a sociolinguistic             process.  Teachers were asked to become more sensitive to the                   speech style differences of their minority students.  Educational               reform initiatives applied the findings from sociolinguistic                    research on cross-cultural and multi-ethnic classroom settings and              broadened participation structures to create educational equity                 among diverse groups.  Similar sociolinguistic assumptions can be               found driving the current reform of mathematics education led by                the National council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM.  The NCTM                standards emphasize communication skills so that all students can               become mathematically literate.  This study focuses on how the NCTM             standards attempt to achieve educational equity through a                       prescribed restructuring of classroom communication and discourse               patterns.  However, critics of the sociolinguistic approach to                  educational equity have argued that broader socioeconomic and                   racial issues prevent some minorities more than others from full                participation in school.                                                                                                                                        This study follows a dual course.  Using a sociolinguistic                      framework, it approaches language usage within the immediate                    setting of the mathematics classroom.  Using an ethnographic                    framework, it examines the broader historical, political, and                   economic contexts within which the classroom and its students are               situated.  A comprehensive sociolinguistic model of elementary                  school mathematics discourse will be constructed which will expand              the anthropological and sociolinguistic notions of context of                   situation and functions of language.  In addition, this study will              address what educators, teachers, and taxpayers need to know about              a.)the cultural and linguistic diversities of students, b.)the                  underlying sociolinguistic assumptions used by the NCTM standards,              c.)the feasibility of the NCTM national mathematics standards, and              d.)the efficacy of national educational reforms that aim to achieve             educational by relying on strategies to restructure classroom                   communication and discourse patterns.",
