Three previous expeditions by the AMNH has succeeded in recovering              a wealth of well-preserved tetrapod vertebrates, especially                     theropod dinosaurs, mammals, and a new lineage of extraordinary                 flightless birds with mole-like adaptations for digging.  These                 expeditions have also mapped old and new localities using GPS.                  Specimen and locality/geological information for the 10,000                     specimens will be entered in a computer database.  Cooperation with             Mongolian authorities and scientists is excellent and includes                  field work in Mongolia and long-term study visits of Mongolian                  scientists to the AMNH.                                                         %%%                                                                             This project will continue a survey of the fossil mammals,                      reptiles, amphibians and birds from the famous Late Cretaceous                  dinosaur beds in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia.  This survey is                     revisiting the sites of the Central Asiatic Expeditions in the                  1920s, which first discovered dinosaur egg nests and other                      important fossils.  Three previous expeditions by this current                  survey team has succeeded in recovering a wealth of well-preserved              fossil vertebrates, especially theropod dinosaurs, mammals, and a               new lineage of extraordinary flightless birds with mole-like                    adaptations for digging. Cooperation with Mongolian authorities and             scientists is excellent and includes field work in Mongolia and                 long-term study visits of Mongolian scientists at the American                  Museum in New York.  Study of the fossils recovered by these                    expeditions will help elucidate the nature of dinosaur extinctions              and climate change 65 million years ago.",
