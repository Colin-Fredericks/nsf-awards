 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of variable stars is basic to much of astronomy.  The                 properties of the variability provide more information than can be              obtained from static stars and they contribute greatly to our                   understanding of stellar structure and evolution, galactic                      evolution and cosmology.  This project concerns modelling of                    stellar instability and understanding its systematics.  A new                   nonlinear adaptive hydrodynamic code which produces better                      agreement between the models and the observations has been                      developed.  This new method resolves and tracks the important                   physical features during the pulsation cycle.  In this study, the               results from the new code will be combined with the PI's previously             developed semi-analytical theory of pulsation to gain insights into             the mechanisms.  The stars which will be considered range from the              regularly varying Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars to the erratic RV                 Tauri stars and Semi-regular variables.  The effects of stochastic              noise on pulsations and methods of analysis of time-dependent                   signals will also be studied in the context of comparing the                    theoretical results with observation.",
