Cornell has a wide variety of major facilities with                    unique equipment for experiments in particle physics and                        studies of condensed matter.  Trainees under the program would                  use these facilities to learn how to devise new methods for                     measuring quantities of fundamental physical interest.  The                     technological training would embrace a wide range of modern and                 complex specialties ranging from accelerator design and very low                temperature physics to microfabrication and materials                           characterization.  Major emphasis would be placed upon filling                  the Traineeships with women and previously underrepresented                     minorities.  The Cornell Physics Department has demonstrated its                commitment to training women physicists with increasing success                 over the past 20 years.  The program would permit an enhancement                of those efforts.",
