 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Kroll's ongoing research seeks to test and develop a model of               memory representation in the bilingual.  The model proposes that                there are asymmetries in the strength of the connections between                words in concepts in different languages that are a consequence of              the manner in which the second language is acquired.  During early              stages of second language learning, the second language learner is              hypothesized to rely on the first language to mediate access to                 meaning.  As a greater fluency in the second language is achieved,              a direct access to meaning becomes possible.  The goal of this                  larger research is to identify the factors that mediate cognitive               change for the adult second language learner.  This project will                further test the proposed model of bilingual memory representation              by examining the conditions under which transfer occurs across                  languages, and by identifying aspects of individual performance in              the first language that predict the attainment of second language               fluency.                                                                                                                                                        Interactive activities at the host institution include:  teaching               a graduate seminar on bilingualism; involving undergraduate women               at the host institution in the research project; and organizing a               colloquium series and informal mentoring seminar for graduate                   student women.                                                                                                                                                  This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers             employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
