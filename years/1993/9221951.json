 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many meteorological phenomenon are controlled and/or                       influenced by the physics of the convective boundary layer.  During             the Convection and Precipitation/Electrification Experiment (CaPE)              held in Florida in 1991, a collection of very advanced                          meteorological instrumentation was brought to bear on a variety of              meteorological problems including those of the boundary layer.                       Using data from the CaPE, the Principal Investigator will                  conduct research with the following five objectives: study of a                 waterspout with Doppler radar and cloud photogrammetry; detailed                analysis of the sea breeze phenomena with emphasis on synoptic flow             regime, along front variation and convective initiation; evolution              of horizontal convective rolls that develop within the boundary                 layer with emphasis on along roll variation of enhanced cloud                   development; analysis of convective initiation resulting from the               collision of two boundaries; analysis of air mass storms in order               toe assess the generality of a generalized thunderstorm conceptual              model recently proposed by the Principal Investigator.",
