 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project at least 100 short case studies or mathematical                 \"snapshots\" are being created.  Each is designed to encourage                   appreciation of mathematics among under-achieving and under-                    motivated students.  Following the compilation of these modules                 involving substantial library research  and industry support,                   they will be class tested at several institutions.                              The project's short case studies differ from existing case                      studies (UMAP, C0MAP, etc.).  They require few prerequisites,                   are shorter, rely mainly upon oral presentation by instructors,                 and are adaptable to a broad range of textbooks.  They are                      supplements to existing course work designed to motivate                        student interest in the subject matter and to show its                          relevance.  Among the studies' goals is  highlighting                           contributions of under-represented groups, thereby providing                    role models for students.                                                       The project is based upon preliminary work which yielded                        promising results.  The studies are being drawn from a broad                    range of fields, all highlighting a \"snapshot\" of applied                       mathematics.  After classroom testing, the project concept and                  results will be disseminated by a regional seminar.  During                     this seminar, not only will participating instructors learn                     about the project and receive a booklet containing the                          developed modules, but these faculty will also be provided the                  skills and knowledge necessary to design and implement studies                  for their classrooms.",
