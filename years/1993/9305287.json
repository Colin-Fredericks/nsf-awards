In this laboratory, preliminary in vivo  evidence has been obtained that the LC is important for the  stabilization of the clathrin heavy chain (HC) in Saccharomyces  cerevisiae.  This is a novel function for LC's, which will be  examined in more detail by taking advantage of the moleuclar  genetic approaches available in the yeast system.  The specific  aims are to: 1, examine the importance of the clathrin light chain  in stabilization of the heavy chain; 2, determine whether  overexpression of HC's can suppress the phenotypes caused by LC-  deficiency (if true, this would suggest that HC's can function in  the absence of LC's); 3, determine whether LC's are involved in  trimerization of HC's; and 4, localize the region of the LC that is  required for HC stabilization.  %%%  In eukaryotic cells, clathrin-coated membranes are involved in the  selective transport of receptors during endocytosis and sorting of  newly synthesized secretory proteins at the trans region of the  Golgi apparatus.  The clathrin triskelion, which forms the  polyhedral lattice found in clathrin-coated membranes, is composed  of three heavy chains of approximately 180 kD and three light  chains of 25-30 kD.  Much information concerning the components  that regulate clathrin-mediated vesicular transport has come from  in vitro biochemical analysis or studies in animal cells.  In this  laoratory, clathrin is being studied in the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae because of the unique opportunities to apply molecular  and genetic methods to the analysis of vesicular transport.    Suppression studies analyzing the effect of overexpression of  clathrin light chains in yeast suggest that light chains are  important for stabilization of clathrin heavy chains.  This  function for light chains, whi ch has not previously been  documented, will be analyzed in vivo using the molecular and  genetic approaches available in the yeast system.  These studies  may lead to practical applications in the area of biotechnology,  particularly in terms of genetically engineering yeasts or other  cell types for improved secretion characteristics.  ***",
