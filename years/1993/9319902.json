 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for a workshop to convene experts and  scientists to assess the unique needs educators have for the rapid  prototyping of integrated circuits and to suggest potential  solutions for continuously improving the state-of-the-art in U.S.  universities.  User data indicates that in some cases resources are  not being used in the most effective manner.  This workshop focuses  on the prototyping facilities offered by MOSIS and how these  facilities can be most effectively utilized by the education  community.  The workshop discusses and makes recommendations in the  areas of:  new technologies; design methodologies; testing; and  policies, procedures, and information dissemination.  Invited  participants from universities, government agencies, and industry  seek to determine how universities can improve their capabilities  in the rapid prototyping of integrated circuits.  A report will be  produced and distributed to microelectronics educators as well as  selected government and industry leaders.",
