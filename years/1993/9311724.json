It is planned to study, at atomic  resolution detail,  the growth of epitaxial diamond films on  natural diamond substrates, and the role that hydrogen plays  in growth.  Polycrystalline films on other substrates will  also be studied.  The overall objectives include the study  of both the nucleation and growth of diamond films, and the  role that hydrogen plays in these processes.  %%%  Diamond films have a large number of potential applications  due to the unique chemical and physical properties of  diamond.  Potential applications for diamond films include  protective coatings, heat sinks, optical windows, and  transistors capable of operation at high temperature, for  example, at the internal operating temperatures of  automobile or airplane engines.  This research is expected  to contribute significantly to our fundamental understanding  of the formation of diamond films at low temperature and  pressure, and thereby to aid in the development of practical  applications of this unique material.  ***",
