The workshops will                        involve two sequential sessions in each of two years.                           During the initial five-day June workshop participants will                     use microcomputers to work actively with data exploration                       software and large scale data bases doing exercises which                       foster scientific thinking, analytic skills and an inquiry-                     based approach to social science teaching and learning.                         Participants use their own data along with data from the                        General Social Survey and the National Election Study to                        develop material for their own courses. Following this workshop                 faculty participants will return to their home campuses and                     experiment with altering curriculum to include quantitative                     instruction.  The following January they will reassemble at a                   three-day follow-up workshop and demonstrate their materials                    for their workshop colleagues.                                                  Throughout the program networking will be encouraged and                        instructional applications shared through a newsletter.",
