 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353453  Bowyer    This project (Leadership Institute for Teaching Elementary Science  or LITES) targets all 1050 elementary teachers located in the 60  schools of the Oakland, California District.  A broad-based  coalition of college, industry, and science center scientists; and  college, school, community, and family educators will be involved  with the LITES effort.  Leader Teachers (180) will participate in  a research-based LITES curriculum for 5 weeks each year for two  years.  They will in turn train a school-site cluster of five same-  grave-level colleague teachers.  Key features of the LITES  curriculum will be: (1) a linkage of four informal science centers  to teach a 4-day thematic science course on ecosystems in  environments that teachers can use year round as living  laboratories for their own learning and classroom teaching; (2) a  technology course taught in an industry setting where teachers can  learn first-hand the complex concepts in this often misunderstood  discipline, and (3) an integration of pedagogy and science subject  matter courses combined with practical classroom experience.  The  Leader Teachers will be assisted in their task by a team of 29  LITES staff who will provide school-site support.  Seventy-two  teachers who have participated in a pilot of the LITES program will  serve as consultants to the Leader Teacher/Colleague Teacher  clusters.    This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because it is  a well-developed systematic project designed to enhance the science  knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills of lead  elementary school teachers of a large, multiethnic (mostly African  American and Hispanic) student population.    Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 70% of the amount requested  from NSF.  ***",
