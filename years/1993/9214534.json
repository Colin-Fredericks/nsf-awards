Specific improvements                               include:  replacement of intake lines/pumps;                                    enhancement of incoming seawater                                                treatment/filtering capabilities; improvement in                                ability to control temperature of seawater; and                                 rehab of wetlabs to improve drainage of seawater                                system and floor drain system.  In addition, these                              funds will enable development of an area of the Lab                             for microalgal culture to support the maintenance                               requirements of experimental cultures of finish and                             shellfish and for use in research ont he feeding,                               dietary and nutritional physiology of these                                     organisms.                                                                           Research at FPL has emphasized the biology of                              coastal marine organisms, particularly shellfish                                and finish.  Predominant have been studies of the                               physiological ecology and aquaculture of benthic                                macrofauna, particularly commercially exploited                                 bivalve molluscs, and examinations of the                                       interactions between reproductive, behavioral, and                              physiological biology int eh evolution of fishes.                               Additional research has dealt with the                                          ecology/physiology of macroalgae, the chemical                                  behavior of stabilized combustion wastes in the                                 marine environment, the extent and rate of                                      degradation of biodegradable plastics int eh marine                             environment, and the effect of chlorinated                                      hydrocarbon pollutants on marine phytoplankton                                  communities.  These will remain important in                                    research/research training conducted at FPL.  The                               proposed will benefit such studies and will also                                make the facility more attractive to workers in                                 other fields, such as biogeochemists at USB's                                   Marine Sciences Research Center (MSRC).",
