 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of the proposed research is to identify genes             that regulate the development of highly specialized structures                  (appressoria) that are essential for rice plant infection by                    Magnaporthe grisea. M. grisea is ideal for these studies since                  infection structure formation can be induced in vitro, the fungus               is highly amenable to both Mendelian and molecular genetic                      manipulation and as a plant pathogen it is of major importance.                 Infection structure formation is initiated following conidia                    germination on certain hydrophobic substrata. After limited                     extension, the germ tube tip swells to form a dome shaped                       attachment structure, the appressorium. An infection hyphae emerges             from the appressorium at the contact interface and penetrates                   directly. Dr. Dean has previously identified two genes, mif23 and               mif29, that are specifically expressed during infection structure               formation. Since these genes respond to environmental signals, he               proposes to fuse promoters to selectable markers in order to obtain             mutations in regulatory pathway genes. He has also identified                   mutants blocked at various stages of development and propose to                 search for more. The affected genes will be genetically mapped and              functionally complemented by DNA transformation. Complementing DNA              will be recovered and the genes cloned and characterized. The                   identification of these genes is paramount to understanding and                 controlling the mechanism(s) regulating cell surface interactions               and fungal infection of plants.",
