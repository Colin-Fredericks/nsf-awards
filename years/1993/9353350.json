 "awd_abstract_narration": "This 4-year Leadership project will target five                                 geographically distributed districts in Wisconsin, and is                       designed to (1) increase participant knowledge of Wisconsin                     geology and ecology; (2) increase the amount of field-based                     science used in the classroom; (3) develop participant                          understanding of the research base of teaching and learning                     as well as the application of that knowledge; (4) develop                       participant leadership skills and apply those skills in                         community and professional activities; and (5) develop a                        professional support network.  The project will also select                     teams of two teachers per school; provide sessions for                          principals that engage them in field-based activities;                          actively work with the teachers in their schools to                             implement a field-based program; utilize a Materials                            Resource Center developed through a present NSF project for                     earth science teachers; and use the experience of the                           Wisconsin Elementary Science Teachers (WEST) to work with                       participants in the development of quality workshops for                        other elementary teachers in the district as well as across                     the state.  Twenty-seven days of scheduled activities, most                     of which are in the field, will be held.  A resource Center                     will provide an overview of available field-based materials                     as well as a source of activities.                                                                                                                              This proposal is appropriate for teacher enhancement because                    it plans a strong Leadership project designed to increase                       the amount of field-based science used in the classroom, and                    to develop participant understanding of the research base of                    teaching and learning as well as the application of that                        knowledge.                                                                                                                                                      Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 38% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
