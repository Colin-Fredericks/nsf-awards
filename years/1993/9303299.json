 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many plants exhibit a similar geographic distribution,                     occurring from southeastern Alaska to northern California.                      Molecular genetic investigations of three species have revealed a               pronounced north-south cytoplasmic discontinuity located south of               the Wisconsin glacial maximum.  These data implicate glaciation as              a possible causal factor in creating the discontinuity and raises               the possibility of a link between phytogeography and the genetic                architecture of plants in the Pacific Northwest.  If so, then other             plants displaying similar geographic distributions should also                  exhibit similar patterns of genetic variation.  This study                      addresses two questions: (a) do similar geographic patterns of                  chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) variation occur throughout a spectrum of                Pacific Northwest plant taxa?, (b) are patterns of variation in                 cytoplasmic and nuclear markers congruent?  Populations of five                 taxonomically diverse taxa (a gymnosperm, a monocot, and dicots                 from Dilleniidae, Rosidae, and Asteridae) having different life                 history features will be examined using cpDNA restriction site                  analysis, rDNA analysis, and enzyme electrophoresis.  From these                data, phylogenies will be generated and patterns of genetic                     variation will be assessed.  Further analysis will address                      biogeographical questions and may help clarify the location and                 extent of suspected glacial refugia.                                            %%%                                                                             Our knowledge of the extent of intraspecific cpDNA variation will               be enhanced through this investigation.  It will also serve to                  facilitate a broad comparison of patterns and extent of cpDNA                   variation within species to that observed for nuclear genetic                   markers, improve knowledge of plant genetic architecture, and                   establish an important link between the areas of systematics and                population genetics.",
