 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311014  Matsueda         This is a project to study the relationship between the  family  and juvenile delinquency.  The researcher  will  use  data  from  the longitudinal National Survey of Children  to  analyze  the  relative  influence  of  family  structure  on  delinquency and the extent to which factors such as  marital  and    parent-child   conflict,   attachment   to   parents,  communication  styles, parental supervision, and  styles  of  parental   discipline  mediate  the  influence   of   family  structure on delinquent behavior.         This   project   has  potential  to  make   important  contributions  to  our  theoretical  understanding  of  both  family  dynamics  and  the sources of juvenile  delinquency.  Research  on  the  connection between family  structure  and  delinquency  stretches back over more than half  a  century,  and  contemporary  social commentators confidently  proclaim  their  views on this connection.  Yet up to now  there  have  not  been  either  suitable data or research  projects  with  sufficient  methodological sophistication  to  allow  claims  about  family-delinquency  links to  be  rigorously  tested.  This  project,  through  its use  of  richer  data  and  its  theoretical and methodological sophistication, will make  it  possible  to  replace hunches and prejudice with  scientific  evidence.  If this project is successful, it should  provide  a  firmer basis for considering policy and interventions  to  help reduce juvenile delinquency.  ***",
