 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to study the structure and dynamical               behavior of liquid crystal phases using optical microscopy, light               and x-ray scattering, and scanning tunneling microscopy.  Systems               to be probed include planar freely suspended liquid crystal films,              ultrathin preparations between solid substrates, liquid crystals                confined to an aerogel matrix, and liquid crystal-solid interface.              The research is directed toward elucidating the effects of surfaces             and reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal fluctuations, ordering             and phase transitions.  The proposed studies are important because              of their fundamental impact on condensed matter physics and due to              technological interests.                                                        %%%                                                                             This research is focused on freely suspended liquid crystal films,              ultrathin preparations between solid substrates, liquid crystals in             porous media, and scanning tunneling microscopy of adsorbed liquid              crystal layers.  The research is directed toward elucidating the                effects of surfaces and reduced dimensionality on liquid crystal                fluctuations, ordering and phase transitions.  Freely suspended                 liquid crystal films are structures of fundamental interest in                  condensed matter physics because they are the thinnest known stable             condensed phase structures and have the largest surface-to-volume               ratio of any condensed phase preparation.  The weak ordering and                strong interface interactions of liquid crystals makes them ideal               materials for studying the physics of condensed phase transition in             porous media.  This area is emerging as an exciting extension of                liquid crystal phase research of the past two decades.  Ultrathin               liquid crystal films between solid substrates are not only of broad             technological interest but they continue to generate a variety of               interesting basic physics problems.",
