 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims study certain hyperbolic-parabolic type                  partial differential equations that arise form mathematical                     physics.  To be considered are: the asymptotic behavior of                      viscous flows toward general Riemann solutions which consist of                 both compressive and expansive waves; metastability of contact                  discontinuities for compressible Navier-Stokes equations and in                 MHD; L_1-nonlinear stability of viscous shock profiles for                      systems of viscous conservation laws; the effects of small                      dissipation on the interactions of  elementary waves; theory of                 viscous shock waves for nonstrictly hyperbolic systems (this is                 of particular significance due to the appearance of so-called                   transitional waves such as overcompressive and crossing shocks;                 it seems that the admissibility of such waves should involve                    nonlinear stability analysis); nonlinear stability of planar                    viscous shocks for systems of conservation law in several space                 dimensions; and the theory of viscous boundary layer for                        compressible fluids, in particular, the interaction of shock                    layer and boundary layers, and the continuous dependence on                     initial data of weak entropy solutions for systems of                           conservation laws.                                                                   Many interesting phenomena arising in physics and other                    branches of natural sciences can be modeled by nonlinear partial                differential equations of hyperbolic-parabolic type. Important                  examples include the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations  for                     compressible inviscid and viscous fluids, the equations of                      electro-magneto field dynamics for electrically conducting                      compressible viscous fluids, the equations of elasticity,                       nonlinear Boltzmann type equations in kinetic theory, and                       equations for combustion, multiphase flows, and fluids with                     chemical reactions.",
