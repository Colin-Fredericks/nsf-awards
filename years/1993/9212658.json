 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Synchrotron Radiation Center (SRC) operated by the                          University of Wisconsin-Madison, is a national facility                         for the utilization of ultra-violet and soft x-ray                              synchrotron radiation in scientific investigations.  The                        studies carried out at the SRC impact condensed matter                          physics, atomic and molecular physics, chemistry,                               materials science and engineering, biology, and other                           disciplines.  The SRC is a user oriented facility which                         accepts proposals from all qualified investigators.  At                         present, more than 300 individuals make up 75 groups                            which conduct research on the 26 operating beamlines at                         the SRC.  Of these groups, 69% are from universities, 19%                       are from national laboratories, and 12% are industrial                          affiliates.  The SRC operation includes nine public                             beamlines, sixteen Participating Research Team (PRT)                            beamlines, one joint SRC/PRT beam line, and three                               beamlines under development.   Eighteen operating lines                         have monochromators.   They cover the photon energy range                       from a few eV to several keV.  The SRC operates at two                          electron energies: 800 MeV and 1 GeV.  A clean room and                         a chemical handling room are maintained for users.                              Several unique beamlines are available including five                           beamlines operated by the Center for X-ray Lithography,                         a beam line developed for high resolution photoemission                         x-ray microscopy utilizing an undulator (Multiple                               Application X-ray Imaging Undulator Microscope-MAXIMUM),                        a high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy beam line                          being developed for band-structure measurements of Fermi-                       surface contours in high-Tc superconducting materials, a                        high precision soft x-ray double-crystal monochromator                          beam line which provides a tunable beam in the 1500-3700                        Ev range for Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure                           studies (EXAFS).",
