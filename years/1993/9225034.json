 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Natural Science Division at                    Pepperdine to continue a successful REU Site.  The funds                        will enhance an already active program of undergraduate                         research in biology.  Students will be taught the common                        elements of the research process and increase their                             appreciation for the diversity of biological subdisciplines.                    In addition, the program provides mechanisms for recruiting                     students from traditionally underrepresented groups in                          science and from schools where students may not have                            opportunities to experience biological research.  Each                          summer the program will begin with a six-day research                           orientation workshop at the Murchison Science Center during                     which students will be introduced to the uses and                               limitations of specific research tools and techniques and                       immersed in the research process (literature review,                            hypothesis formulation, and hypothesis testing).  After the                     orientation workshop, students will pursue individual                           research projects under the direction of faculty in either                      cellular biochemistry, behavioral ecology, plant                                physiological ecology or ecophysiology of marine intertidal                     animals.  All research projects will be designed to provide                     students with insight into how scientists formulate research                    questions, design experiments, collect and analyze data, and                    communicate their results to the scientific community.  Over                    the course of the summer, visiting scientists will hold                         special research seminars in each research area, giving                         students an opportunity to discuss their own data with other                    scientists.  Each research group will hold weekly literature                    seminars to discuss current journal articles pertaining to                      their research interests.  The program will conclude each                       summer with a student research symposium in early August.                       Follow-through will include student participation at local                      and regional undergraduate research conferences.  In cases                      of special merit, students will be encouraged to present                        their results at national meetings and to prepare their                         results for publication in a scientific journal.",
