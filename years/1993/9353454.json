 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353454  Saul    The Elementary Science Integration Project (ESIP) promotes  integration of hands-on inquiry-centered elementary school  science instruction with language arts and other subject areas.  Teachers are encouraged to work as classroom researchers engaged  in \"action research\" with students on a variety of topics that  arise in the classroom.  A 1990 NSF Teacher Enhancement award has  supported professional development for approximately 50 teachers  who are now prepared to act as teacher-consultants in training 65  new ESIP participants.  Teacher enhancement activities would  include two summers and the intervening academic year.  This  approach stresses the strengths shared by many elementary  schoolteachers -- the ability to recognize and pursue topics of  interest to their students.  Past ESIP participants have been  extremely productive in writing and publishing the results of  their classroom research, and in sharing their experiences with  other teachers through presentations and inservice workshops.     Expansion of ESIP to more teachers will create a critical mass of  classroom teachers who are capable of fostering inquiry  activities that cross disciplinary boundaries.  Their teaching  and writing will serve as a model for an innovative approach to  the professional development of teachers.     Cost sharing on this project represents 23% of the NSF  contribution.  ***",
