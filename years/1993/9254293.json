 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a joint project of the New Jersey Institute of                          Technology as lead institution for the North/Central New Jersey                 and Camden County College as lead institution for the Southern                  New Jersey CIM Consortia.  The consortia operate fully                          articulated programs aimed at the AAS and BSET degrees in                       Manufacturing Engineering Technology.  The consortia consists                   of 13 community colleges and NJIT in the North/Central; Camden                  County College, 5 other community colleges and NJIT in the                      Southern.                                                                       Articulated curricula of the two consortia include a two course                 sequence in Manufacturing Systems.  This sequence is critical                   to the success of the program.  Significant deviations in                       course content and emphasis among the member colleges have been                 noted.                                                                          This project will solicit input from the manufacturing industry                 on required skills which should be attained through the first                   course of the two-course sequence.  During a summer Curriculum                  Development Institute, selected faculty members will develop                    model curricula and training modules.  The project will also                    identify possibilities for sharing of laboratory resources in                   support of the model.",
