 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the formation of an undergraduate polymer                 laboratory course. The instruments acquired are used in an                      existing undergraduate laboratory course, for additional                        experiments. The two instruments are:  a Size Exclusion                         Chromatography unit to determine polymer molecular weight                       distribution; and a Torsional Rheometer to characterize the                     rheological behavior of the material. The project also involves                 the construction of controlled-environment glove boxes to run                   polymer synthesis reactions. Students are guided through the                    three basic stages of synthesis, characterization, and                          fabrication. Several groups are formed, each with the                           responsibility of producing and characterizing a sample of                      given molecular weight.  The characterization involves                          measurement of the polymer's molecular weight distribution and                  its moments, study of the thermo-rheological behavior of the                    material, and establishment of a correlation between the two.                   Samples from different groups are blended to achieve                            predetermined characteristics and finally processed in model                    operations such as extrusion, molding, or spin coating.  By                     being allowed to experiment with the above instruments, the                     students develop a natural feeling for cause-and-effect                         relations associated with material properties. The instruments                  have been selected to minimize operator-training times, while                   achieving a most favorable compromise in terms of versatility,                  sophistication, and cost.",
