 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anyone who has ever tried to learn to play a musical instrument has             had the experience of feeling \"all thumbs\".  With practice, one                 becomes more skilled, but it is always difficult to conceptualize               what one has actually learned.  What is the difference between                  skilled and unskilled motor behavior?  Dr. Kruger, and his                      colleagues, a physicist and a musician, with the help of two                    undergraduate research assistants, will identify differences in                 wrist and elbow movements between skilled and unskilled trombone                players.  They will use sophisticated biomechanical recording                   equipment to determine the relative influence of kinesthetic,                   visual and auditory feedback on motor control.  This work will                  contribute to increased understanding of movement related injuries              and improved teaching methods for musicians and athletes.  This                 grant will also establish a model for teaching interdisciplinary                research skills at the undergraduate level.***//",
