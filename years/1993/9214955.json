 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in                  inorganic chemistry between Kenneth J. Takeuchi of the State                    University of New York at Buffalo and James Cameron of                          Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.  The investigators                 propose to synthesize new ruthenium (II) complexes which utilize                novel macrocyclic ligands. Dr. Takeuchi brings to this                          collaboration his expertise in the synthesis of novel catalytic                 systems and ruthenium complexes.  This is complemented by Dr.                   Cameron's background in organic chemistry and his expertise in                  the design and production of these unique organic ligands.                      Within the context of this collaboration, Dr. Takeuchi's advanced               graduate students will travel to Scotland to work with Dr.                      Cameron and his group. Initially, the collaborative research will               take place at Heriot Watt University, where Dr. Cameron and                     the U.S. graduate students will jointly synthesis and characterize              the macrocyclic ligands.  At SUNY Buffalo Dr. Takeuchi and his                  group will then substitute ruthenium into the macrocylic ligands                to produce new ruthenium complexes.  Subsequently, kinetic                      studies of inorganic and organic substances using the new                       complexes will be initiated.                                                                                                                                    This collaborative effort on ruthenium complexes will enhance                   our general understanding of catalytic systems.  The new                        ruthenium complexes could lead to more effective catalysts and                  further understanding of effects of catalytic performance.",
