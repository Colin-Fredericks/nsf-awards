 "awd_abstract_narration": "9225123  Beck  Dr. Thomas L. Beck is supported by a grant from the Theoretical  and Computational Chemistry Program to perform research in the  following two areas:  1) computer simulations and statistical  mechanical theory of a tethered alkane-polar solution which is  a model for reversed phase liquid chromatography; and 2)  calculation of chemical potentials in quantum systems with  applications to solubilities.  Beck will apply a combination of  computer simulation methodologies such as Stationary Phase  Monte Carlo and Coherent State Path Integration as well as  statistical mechanical theory to these theoretical problems.  %%%  Polymers adsorbed or chemically bonded to surfaces form the  basis for several technologically and biologically important  processes, e.g., molecular electronics, polymer coatings, and  model membranes.  Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) is  an important chemical separation technique which depends on  such an interface.  Dr. Beck's research will help to understand  the detailed mechanism for this separation technique at the  molecular level.  In a second set of studies, Beck will examine  the fundamental theory behind the unusual quantum behavior of  of light elements at low temperatures.  This has important  implications with regard to the solubility of various atoms and  molecules in liquid helium, and the storage of hydrogen  isotopes in metals.  ***",
