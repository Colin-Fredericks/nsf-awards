 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218347  Tong  The goal of this project is to purify, characterize, and determine  the effects on flavor and ripening of an endogenous tomato fruit  trigger of ethylene production which we have previously partially  purified from fruit cell walls.  This trigger is produced when the  fruit are unripe and before ethylene production begins.  It will  induce ethylene synthesis and red color development in normal  ripening fruit as well as in mutant fruit that normally do not  produce ethylene or turn red when ripe.  It clearly has a role in  fruit ripening, affecting ethylene synthesis and therefore fruit  softening and color development.  Preliminary characterization of  the trigger has shown that it contains both carbohydrate and  protein.  The proposed project will 1) determine if both  carbohydrate and protein are necessary for trigger activity by  selectively degrading the carbohydrate or protein moiety using  enzymes or chemicals and then testing for activity, and 2) purify  the endogenous trigger using various chromatographic procedures.   Achieving the goals of this project should provide new information  in an under-studied area of plant hormone research, the onset of  hormone production.  ***",
