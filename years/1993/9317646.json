This study a step in determining how such decisions are made and what their impact is on the creation and implementation of technological innovation. Technological and scientific innovations that are supported by good data can withstand legal tests    provided that scientific and technological testimony introduced into courts of law or other legal proceedings can be understood by lay jurors and judges.  If not, juries and judges are likely to make decisions on scientific and technological matters on grounds that may be at variance with expert testimony.  In addition to being potentially unjust, the fear that such an event might occur may cause technologically based companies to refrain from introducing innovations.  This is a study of the production, delivery and reception of expert scientific/technological testimony.  The research is divided into two phases.  The first phase assesses the degree to which industry is concerned about not being able to convince the judicial system of the scientific and technological underpinnings of its innovations and consequently errs on the conservative side in producing such innovations.  This will be accomplished using focus groups composed of individuals from relevant professions, patent attorneys, and technical managers.  The second phase is an experimental research approach to unders tanding some of the issues involved in presenting complex scientific and technological testimony to lay juries.  Using the methods of experimental social psychology, the studies test hypotheses derived from theories of attitude change.  It is predicted that jurors or other decision makers may not always be able to comprehend the scientific and technological testimony of experts.  Consequently, rather than attempt to process the arguments, the decision makers avail themselves of peripheral or heuristic decision rules.  For example, they may base their decisions on the background of the expert rather than  the substance of the expert's arguments.  In the experiments, juror subjects watch a videotape recreation of a civil trial involving the  expert testimony.  The first two experiments examine the effects of complexity of the testimony and whether increased  complexity does indeed drive jurors to rely on peripheral cues when making decisions.  The third experiment tackles the  question of the persuasiveness of paid expert witnesses and examines the hypothesis that, regardless of the validity of  testimony, experts are discounted relative to an expert selected by the court.",
