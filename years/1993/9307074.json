 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in geometric singular perturbation theory                  have established a powerful set of tools for analyzing resonance                phenomena and homoclinic orbits in systems of ordinary                          differential equations with two time or length scales. Among                    these new tools is the Exponentially Small Exchange Lemma (called               EXSEL), which was developed by the author with C. Jones and N.                  Kopell, and which has been used successfully to prove the                       existence of multiple fast-pulse homoclinic orbits in perturbed                 multi-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems, as well as in                      traveling wave problems for coupled reaction diffusion equations.               It is proposed here to analyze four fundamental aspects of                      resonance phenomena in singularly-perturbed systems: (1) the                    existence of resonant sub- and super-harmonic orbits, (2) the                   geometry of islands of stability, which are obstructions to                     mixing in adiabatic chaos, (3) the resonant response of                         homoclinic structures in the forced, damped sine-Gordon equation                which are conjectured to be sources of chaos, (4) the existence                 of periodic orbits in problems of passage throughresonance.                          Physical problems with multiple time scales arise in many                  branches of science and technology, including fluid mechanics,                  accelerator dynamics, plasma physics, neurophysiology, and                      biology. These problems are modeled mathematically as                           singularly-perturbed or adiabatic systems.  Despite the long                    history of progress and the considerable continuing interest in                 this area, a wealth of open problems exists. This proposal                      concerns a group of four fundamental mathematical questions                     concerning resonance phenomena and homoclinic behavior that are                 of direct significance in the applications. Several new                         mathematical techniques, some developed by the author, have                     recently become available which offer substantial promise of                    solving these problems. While the main goal of the work proposed                here is to use and extend the scope of these new tools, it is                   also endeavored to answer the above questions with an eye toward                the technological applications. Toward this end, the proposer                   points to his successful development of enhanced fluid-mixing                   technology as an application of his earlier work on the geometry                of homoclinic tangles in singularly-perturbed systems.",
