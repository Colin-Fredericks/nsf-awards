 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort with  scientists in two disciplines, computer science and  biology.  Such a  collaboration is essential for the success  of the development of computational  tools and their later  use in biological research.  The first crucial step,  which  is to understanding the biological problem at hand in  mathematical terms  and to translate this into a  mathematical problem with a clear objective,  provides the  foundation of this proposal.  In this project, the  resulting  mathematical problems are tackled by the computer scientist and their  solutions are implemented  and then used in biological research.  These  computational tools are of interest in their own right and are  likely to find application outside the biological area.   The focus  of this work is a study of alpha-helical coiled  coil proteins.  The  streptococcal M-protein serves as a model protein.  For the majority of  proteins, the secondary  structure of the protein, which is critical for its  proper  function, cannot simply be resolved by examining the  sequence of the  amino acids that define the protein.  While  x-ray crystallography is the only  reliable means available  today by which to solve the structure of a protein  molecule,  it cannot always be used.  The alpha-helical structure is  commonly  found in proteins because of its ability to  stabilize proteins through short  regions of helix-helix  packing, referred to as a coiled-coil interaction.  The main goal of this project is to develop computational  tools that   enable the comparison of surface characteristics of two M proteins, and more  generally of any  two coiled-coil proteins.  Algorithms are devised to  identify identical amino acid clusters on the outer surface  of coiled-coil  proteins.  Such clusters, which are not  readily identified through linear  sequence homology, could  predict the formulation of cross-reactive epitopes  between  microbial and mammalian molecules .  This is then verified by the  synthesis of the peptide region and a  variety of serological tests.  Algorithms  are also designed to identify and display tandem repeat blocks in  sequences.  At the DNA level, these represent mutational `hot  spots.`  In  bacterial proteins the function of these repeats  is not fully understood, but  perhaps they have evolved as a  means of mutating orders of magnitude more  frequently than  spontaneous mutation events.  Finally, the sequence of M  proteins from strains of the same serotype, (M6), which were  isolated over the  last century are compared.",
