 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305007  Dunn    Floral homeotic genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum  majus have been shown to share considerable sequence similarity  with transcription factors from yeast (MCM1) and humans (SRF). all  of these putative transcription factors contain a highly conserved  DNA binding domain called the MADS box and are responsible for  transducing environmental signals influencing organ development. To  address the possibility that a member of this class of  transcriptional regulators may be active in alfalfa root nodule  development, degenerate oligonucleotides were designed to conserved  sequences flanking the MADS box domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana  ap3 homeotic gene. Preliminary data suggests that alfalfa root  nodules express a MADS box gene localized primarily in the infected  cells of the nodule. This factor is likely to play a role in both  receiving signals originating from the bacteria and in transmitting  the environmental cue to a cellular response. The first part of  this project characterizes the alfalfa MADS box gene and examines  its expression in several tissues. The second part of the project  addresses questions about the function of this gene. The alfalfa  MADS box domain will be inserted in place of the homologous region  of the MCM1 deletion. The target genes of the alfalfa MADS box  protein will be investigated by examining its specific binding to  nodule specific plant promoters. The information produced from this  study will be used to further examine the interaction of the MADS  box protein with both plant promoters as well as bacterial factors  required to bring about the desired symbiotic response.  ***",
