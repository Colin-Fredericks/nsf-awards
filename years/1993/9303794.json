 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303794  Aksay       This transmission electron microscope (TEM) with analytical  and high resolution imaging attachments will be used to improve  research and education in materials sciences and engineering at  Princeton University.  The Princeton Materials Institute (PMI) will  provide the location and support for a multidisciplinary TEM  center.  Materials research at Princeton University involves  collaboration among 55 faculty members from several departments  (Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering, Physics,  Chemistry, Molecular Biology, and Earth Sciences) and is  coordinated by the PMI.       The primary TEM system will comprise:  (i)a TEM with a high  resolution pole piece for high resolution electron microscopy  (HREM) imaging and convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED),  (ii)a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) accessory   (iii)an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), (iv)an electron  energy loss spectrometer (EELS) with an energy filter, and (v)a  multichannel analyzer and support computers for data acquisition,  storage, and processing.       This instrument is capable of high spatial resolution imaging  of crystalline and amorphous structures, small-beam electron  diffraction, and compositional and spectroscopic analyses of micro-  and nano-scale features, all necessary tools for characterizing  materials structures.  It will replace the present TEM (Philips  400) which has inadequate spatial resolution and no analytical  attachments.  Although the current microscope cannot be used for  high resolution studies, it will be retained for teaching. In fact,  PMI is promoting a series of courses for both graduates and  undergraduates in which electron microscopy is taught.       The recognition of the importance of TEM to Princeton is  evidenced by the dedication of laboratory space specifically for  this instrument in the new PMI building and the appointment of new  faculty and staff with expertise in both TEM and materials  sciences.  These sc ientists will serve as a dedicated core of  microscopists who will enable the microscopy facility to meet the  critical demands of the present research and educational needs as  well as to open new avenues in teaching and collaborative research  in materials sciences at Princeton University.  ***",
