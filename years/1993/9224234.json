 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agroforestry has bound new popularity in many less-                             developed countries as farmers and farm researchers                             rediscover its potential for conserving tropical soils                          while boosting long-term farm production.  However,                             pest control in agroforestry has received little                                attention.  The importance of such research was                                 underscored recently when stands of the popular                                 agroforestry tree species Leucaena leucocephala (Lam)                           de Wit in Asia were decimated by an invasion of the                             introduced psyllid pest Heteropsylla cubana Crawford                            (Homoptera: Psyllidae).  The project proposed herein                            offers to outline the scientific basis of the L.                                leucocephala/H.cubana problem by linking tree growth                            and psyllid population dynamics to energy allocation at                         each trophic level.  Central to this effort is the                              development of a strategic simulation model.  Data on                           energy allocation and maximum age-specific growth rates                         for tree and herbivore will be collected under varying                          nutrient regimes, primarily using simple dry matter                             measurements.  Other growth parameters will be                                  determined experimentally or drawn from the extensive                           literature on Leucaena leucocephala.  The model will                            then be validated against at least one year's worth of                          data not used in the original parameterization,                                 obtained from several sites in Thailand.  Sensitivity                           analyses will be conducted on mortality factors,                                weather and other variables to deduce those most likely                         to promote psyllid outbreaks.  Thailand has had                                 significant problems with the psyllid epidemic, and the                         proposed research will be conducted incooperation with                          that country's national biological control program.                             The resulting model will find immediate application in                          estimating yield losses due to the herbivore, planning                          leucaena psyllid biological control programs,                                   delineating high-risk areas for leucaena cultivation,                           and developing improved cultural controls for the pest                          in less-developed countries.  The effort could also lay                         the groundwork for analyzing pest problems in other                             agroforestry tree species.",
