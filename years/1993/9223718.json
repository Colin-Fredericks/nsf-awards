 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reaction engineering deals with the quantification of                           molecular interactions at solid surfaces, transport phenomena,                  dynamics and control of reaction systems and the interplay of                   all of the above.  The size scale ranges from 10-10 to 102                      meters.  The application of reaction engineering principles is                  essential in experimentation, scale-up, and design for                          chemical, biochemical, petroleum, electrochemical and other                     processes.  Reaction engineering is an interactive discipline                   whose initial applications were confined to the petroleum and                   chemical industries, but current utilization of these                           principles is spreading to the biotechnology, electronics, and                  specialty chemical industries where the emphasis is upon new                    meterials.                                                                                                                                                      Three Engineering Foundation Conferences in Chemical Reaction                   Engineering have been held in the past that have focussed on                    the various research issues of the day in this area.  This                      grant is partial support for the fourth Engineering Foundation                  Conference whose main theme is to open pathways between                         chemists and chemical engineers by cross-cutting the                            established boundaries between these two disciplines with                       topically and technically common themes.  The meeting will be                   divided into four days that cover catalysis, kinetics,                          modeling, and reactors and its overall format will be similar                   to the \"Gordon Research Conference\" style with ample time for                   lengthy discussions.***",
