 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants' responses to changes in their environments may be                  crucial for survival and reproduction, particularly under                       stressful conditions.  The term 'reaction norm' refers to the                   responses of an organism (actual and potential) to environmental                variation.  The nature of these responses to the environment is                 under genetic control, and there are several ways that control                  can be manifested.  The form of the genetic control is important                because it will determine whether selection, either in the wild                 or in agriculture, can alter the ways that plants respond to                    changes in environmental factors such as light, water, nutrients                or herbivores.                                                                       The experiments being undertaken will reveal the genetic                   components of response to a gradient in soil nutrients, using a                 model plant system, Arabidopsis thaliana.  In addition, we will                 impose a regime of artificial selection on Arabidopsis                          populations to determine the ability of these plants to alter                   their reaction norms, that is, to change their abilities to                     respond to changes in the level of nutrients.  The results of                   these two sets of experiments will provide a better understanding               of the genetic determination of reaction norms, and of how                      selection may operate to change reaction norms.  Such an                        understanding may become increasingly important as we try to                    evaluate the impact of global environmental change on both wild                 and agricultural plant species.",
