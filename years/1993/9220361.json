 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of most protein hormones is monitored in part                 by the number of cell surface receptors for these hormones. By                  internalizing the number of cell surface receptors after binding                hormone (down regulation), a cell can regulate its sensitivity to               that messenger. The insulin- insulin receptor complex is one                    system that responds in this fashion. Any deviations in this self-              monitoring mechanism can have profound effects on the ability of                the cell to respond to these hormones, and this in turn can have                great impact on cell function. The goal of this proposal is to                  determine the roles that particular molecules, notably membrane                 lipids, cytoskeletal proteins and phosphorylated membrane                       proteins have on this process. The cell system used is the human                erythrocyte. In the lipid studies, the lipid content or fluidity                will be altered, and the effects on down regulation studied. In                 the cytoskeletal work, chemical and antibody-induced changes, and               pathologically -altered cytoskeletons will be studied. Chemicals                know to alter protein phosphorylation will be used to determine                 the impact of this protein modification on down regulation. These               studies should lead to a clearer understanding of the role of                   these components in this process.",
