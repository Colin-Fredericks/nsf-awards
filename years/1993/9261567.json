 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carbon fiber-reinforced in SiC whisker-reinforced molybdenum                    disilicide (MoSi2) matrix composites have been identified as                    excellent candidates for high temperature structural applications               in oxidizing environments.  However, the room temperature fracture              toughness and high temperature yield and creep strength of these                materials can still be drastically improved, and processing issues              must be resolved.  In this Phase I proposal, Ultramet proposes to               demonstrate the feasibility of several fabrication methods for                  MoSi2 matrix composites that are capable of eliminating the major               sources of processing flaws and of greatly increasing process                   repeatability and cost-effectiveness, while enhancing mechanical                properties.  MoSi2-coated whiskers and MoSi2-infiltrated carbon                 fabric will be fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with               several alloy microstructures, followed by properties measurements.             These results will be compared to available data for SiC/MoSi2,                 C/C, and C/SiC materials, and an analysis of cost, reliability,                 fabricability, and performance will be conducted.                                                                                                               The most immediate application for MoSi2 composites for engine hot              section components, and industrial furnace equipment is another                 potential market.  Also, with upcoming EPA requirements for                     drastically reduced emissions, new materials such as MoSi2 will be              required in much greater quantities to withstand the higher                     temperatures associated with clean-burning, low-Nox technology.",
