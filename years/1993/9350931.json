 "awd_abstract_narration": "The institution is firmly committed to significantly enhance                    instruction in the plant sciences. A major goal is to develop                   a program in plant physiology, with a special emphasis on                       environmental plant physiology or ecophysiology. Key items of                   equipment are being used to teach concepts and experimental                     methods in microclimatology, radiation interception and leaf                    energy balance, water relations, photosynthesis, growth                         performance, and efficient data acquisition and analysis. The                   equipment is also being used for several exercises in the                       Ecology and General Biology courses. It is expected that our                    enhanced program will prepare majors for successful graduate                    work and productive careers in plant physiology, and that our                   approach can serve as a model for such programs in other                        institutions.",
