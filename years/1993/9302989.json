 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ruan will continue his investigations in operator spaces.                  This will include the connection with Banach spaces and the                     application to C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, non-self-                  adjoint operator algebras, and applications of operator spaces to               quantum groups.                                                                      The general area of mathematics of this project has its basis              in the theory of algebras of Hilbert space operators.  Operators                can be thought of as finite or infinite matrices of complex                     numbers.  Special types of operators are often put together in an               algebra, naturally called an operator algebra.  These abstract                  objects have a surprising variety of applications.  For example,                they play a key role in knot theory, which in turn is  currently                being used to study the structure of DNA, and they are of                       fundamental importance in noncommutative geometry, which is                     becoming increasingly important in physics.",
