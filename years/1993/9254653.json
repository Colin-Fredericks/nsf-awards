 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project called 'Team Science' will directly aid the                        school districts of northeastern North Carolina where there                     are a disproportionate share of rural, poor and minority                        children.  Thirty-two teachers each year from these counties                    will be brought to North Carolina State University for a four                   week program which will emphasize hands-on learning through a                   mixture of low-tech, \"homemade science\" activities and high-                    tech microcomputer based laboratory activities.  The pedagogy                   will emphasize cooperative learning, station laboratories, and                  the integration of physics and chemistry.  The teachers will                    jointly plan and schedule their teaching programs for a van                     which will visit their school at least once each semester                       during the academic year.  This van will be loaded with new                     physics and chemistry station laboratories and microcomputers                   and will be driven by a master teacher who has worked with                      each of the participants during the summer.  They teachers are                  selected in teams of two, physics and chemistry, for this                       project.  The Science House faculty will maintain the                           equipment and provide other support over the year.  During the                  year the teachers will meet at least four times to discuss                      their successes and problems.  The teachers will return to the                  university for a second summer session, building on the                         previous summer and the experience of the academic year.  In                    addition  a new cohort of 32 teachers from new high schools                     will be chosen and started in the project with a second van to                  visit their schools.  A third cohort will then be chosen for                    years 3 and 4.  This project has a 11.5% sharing of the cost                    of the grant.",
