 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310362  Goulder    In recent years there has been a significant increase in interest  in the potential of taxes as instruments of environmental policy.   This interest has stimulated many simulation studies to investigate  the economic costs and benefits of environmental taxes.    To date, nearly all such studies have suffered from two important  limitations.  First, they tend to assume that the revenues earned  by such taxes are returned to the economy in lump-sum fashion.   This may lead to an overstatement of economic costs because it  overlooks the offsetting efficiency gains that would accrue from  using revenues to reduce existing distortionary taxes.  A second  limitation is the assumption that environmental taxes are imposed  in a system without pre-existing tax distortions.  Recent  analytical work indicates, however, that pre-existing taxes in  commodity and factor markets can importantly influence the costs of  newly imposed environmental taxes.    For this study the investigator will apply a dynamic general  equilibrium model to evaluate major potential environmental tax  initiatives.  The model combines a close attention to U.S. taxes  with attention to energy sector interactions, conversions to  backstop technologies, and capital adjustment dynamics.  These  features distinguish the model from other general equilibrium  models that examine energy and environmental tax initiatives and  make it particularly useful for evaluating revenue-neutral  environmental taxes in a second best economy.    This investigation includes three main tasks.  The first is to  apply the model to evaluate major potential environmental tax  initiatives.  These include carbon taxes, taxes on carbon and on  sources of other greenhouse gases, subsidies to carbon sinks, BTU  taxes, and gasolines taxes.  Under each tax several policy variants  will be considered, including alternative methods for revenue  replacement and alternative treatments of internationally traded  goods.  These policies will be examine d along many dimensions,  including effects on aggregate income and consumption and on  industry profits and output.  Policies will be compared in terms of  their costs in achieving given emissions reductions.    The second main task is to use the model (through counterfactual  simulation) to clarify and quantify the relationships between the  magnitudes of pre-existing taxes and the costs of achieving  emissions reductions.  This work is intended to generate insights  as to the comparative costs of revenue-neutral environmental taxes  in nations where pre-existing tax rates differ significantly from  those in the U.S.  The third main task is to perform econometric  and other work to improve the empirical foundations of the model.   The econometric work includes estimation of industry production  functions and household demand functions.  ***",
