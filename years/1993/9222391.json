 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222391  Boyd  One of the most useful qualities of a properly designed feedback  control system is robustness, i.e., the ability of the closed-  loop system to continue working well despite large variations in  the (open-loop) plant dynamics.  This property is also the source  of some of the hardest problems in control system analysis and  synthesis.  For example, the problem of determining a feedback  law that is guaranteed to work well when connected to any plant  model from a given set of models-the robust synthesis problem-is  in general quite difficult.  A recent advance is an analytic  solution to a specific type of robust synthesis problem.  This  analytic solution can be derived in several different frameworks:   Hoo-optimal control, linear-quadratic game-theoretic control, or  linear exponential quadratic Gaussian (LEQG) optimal control.  In  contrast, this research centers around a method that couples  Lyapunov theory with (numerical) convex optimization (but is  closely connected with the analytic solution method mentioned  above).  In particular, newly developed interior point  optimization methods will be applied to some convex and  quasiconvex problems that arise in control theory (analysis and  synthesis).  Preliminary investigations suggest that the impact  of interior point methods on Lyapunov function and state feedback  search problems will be as profound as it has been on linear and  quadratic programming.  The goal of the research is to develop  the foundations for method of control system robustness analysis  and robust controller synthesis that substitutes convex  optimization for the computations required in the analytic  solution mentioned above, but in return solves a much larger  class of problems.  Moreover, with interior point optimization  methods, the increase in computation effort over that required  for the analytic solution, may be quite modest.   ***",
