The program's awards                                     provide opportunities for joint research, and                                   the use of unique or complementary facilities,                                  expertise and experimental conditions abroad.                                                                                                                   This award will support a twelve-month                                          postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Edward J.                                    Brook of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution                                   to work with Dr. Atle Nesje of the University                                   of Bergen at the Centre de Spectrometrie                                        Nucleare et de Spectrometrie de Masse (CSNSM)                                   in Orsay, France.                                                                                                                                               This project proposes to answer fundamental                                     questions about weathering boundaries in                                        Scandinavia and eastern Canada which provide                                    important constraints on the history and size                                   of past Northern Hemisphere Ice Sheets.  The                                    primary uncertainties in interpreting the                                       significance of the boundaries are that the age                                 of associated bedrock surfaces are not known                                    and their mode of origin (ice limit vs. thermal                                 boundary) is unclear.  Dr. Brook and Dr. Nesje                                  will date bedrock surfaces associated with                                      weathering boundaries in western Norway using                                   cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al.  The results can be                                   used to evaluate existing models of the                                         Scandinavian ice sheet, theories about                                          biological refugia during the last glaciation,                                  and the processes that form weathering                                          boundaries in arctic and sub-arctic                                             environments.                                                                                                                                                   The award recommendation provides funds to                                      cover international travel, a stipend for                                       twelve months and $300 for excess baggage.",
