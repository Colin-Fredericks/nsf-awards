 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of an REU site, which involves              approximately ten undergraduate students per year in a summer                   internship program.  The fields of study are all thrust areas                   within the Department of Physics at UAH, and include space plasma               physics, optics, and materials science.  These related topics are               presented under the unified theme of \"Space Physics and                         Instrumentation\".  Students will be involved in the study of                    materials used in the construction of, and optical characteristics              of, space instrumentation, as well as in the scientific return from             spacecraft and ground-based instruments studying the Earth, the                 Sun, and astronomical objects.  The students, and their advising                faculty, will meet weekly as a group to discuss progress.  The                  proposed topics constitute genuine research endeavors, yet, as our              experience shows, can realistically be completed in one summer.                      Recruitment is primarily targeted as students outside the                  local area, but within the Southeast region.  Women and minorities              will be especially targeted; indeed over 70% of the students funded             the previous award were women.  The research environment is                     outstanding, and students will have many opportunities to interact              with scientists and facilities both in local industry and at the                nearby NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.                                       #",
