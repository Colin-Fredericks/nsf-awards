 "awd_abstract_narration": "All statistical procedures result in an inference, a                       statement that is based on both the observed data and the assumed               model.  Since there are often model assumptions that are                        difficult (or impossible) to check, it is desirable for                         inferences to be robust against model assumptions.  The                         inferences that we are most concerned about are post (data                      accuracy measures for confidence sets and hypothesis tests.  Such               measures are often derived through decision theoretic or Bayesian               arguments, hence are based on assumptions about sampling                        distributions, loss functions, and prior distributions.  Here we                want to investigate the performance of accuracy estimators, using               both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, as the underlying                       assumptions are relaxed.  We are most interested in procedures                  constructed from default priors, for these tend to perform well                 under both frequentist and Bayesian scrutiny.  One way that we                  will address the sampling robustness is to combine the default                  priors with an empirical likelihood to obtain a (somewhat)                      automatic inference robust procedure.  Robustness of inference                  will be judged using a variety of criteria such as ranges of                    posterior probabilities, multiple and distance penalizing loss                  functions and a new (and promising) theory of dilation of                       probabilities.",
