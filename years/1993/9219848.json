 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Margaret Nelson, Mr Michael Diehl will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will study materials             at a number of U.S. museums which house archaeological collections              from the Mogollon region of New Mexico. The goal of the work is to              examine the emergence of inequality within social groups over time.             Dr. Diehl will focus on the Early and Late Pithouse periods because             over this time period clear changes in subsistence and settlement               strategy are documented in the archaeological record. Pithouse                  peoples started as highly moble hunters and collectors and over                 time appear to have settled in larger groupings. Sites were                     occupied for longer periods of time and dependence on agriculture               appears to have increased. In many parts of the world similar                   changes are correlated with the emergence of social inequality                  among domestic household units. It is unclear whether a this                    phenomenon occurred among Pithouse peoples and Mr. Diehl will                   examine this question. More importantly, he will try to discern the             underlying mechanisms which underlay the changes which took place               and try to determine precise cause and effect relationships. To                 accomplish this, he will examine excavation documents, botanical                remains, ceramics and \"luxury\" items from a series of sites which               span this time period. In this way he can reconstruct changes in                subsistence, settlement and social differentiation.                                                                                                             This research is important for several reasons. Social inequality               is both a fact of life and a cause of problems which face many                  societies today. Anthropologists wish to understand how this                    phenomenon originally arose and this research will address the                  issue. It will also assist in the training of a promising young                 scientist.",
