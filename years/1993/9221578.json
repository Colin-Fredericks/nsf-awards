 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the renewal of a study of the vertical flux and the             rate of dissolution of biogenic silica in the water column of the               Ross Sea, and is part of a coordinated study of the biogenic silica             and organic carbon cycling in the water column and the sediments of             the Ross Sea.  The antarctic deep sea and continental shelf                     environment is the major repository for silica accumulation in the              global ocean, and dominates the global silica budget.  The Ross Sea             is a particularly anomalous area in which large amounts of biogenic             silica are accumulating in modern sediments, while the surface                  production rates are generally below the global average.  Moreover              the usual similarity between the oceanic silicon and carbon cycle               does not appear to hold around Antarctica, and the two cycles are               decoupled in that the rate of particulate carbon deposition in the              modern sediment is very low.  The overall project is an integrated              study of the production, vertical transport, dissolution, and                   deposition processes, using moored instrumentation and direct                   observations in a series of transects in the Ross Sea by R/V POLAR              DUKE, carried out between 1989 and 1991.                                                                                                                        The vertical flux and dissolution rates were measured by deploying              time-series sediment traps at two depths on each of three moorings              for a period of fourteen months.  In conjunction with                           transmissometers and current meter arrays, these moorings will                  allow the measurement and characterization of both vertical and                 horizontal fluxes of particulate matter during a complete annual                cycle of production and sedimentation.  The objectives of this                  renewal are to recover one sediment trap that was redeployed for an             additional two years, to complete the analysis of all water column              and sediment trap samples that are currently in hand, and to                    produce a synthesis of all project data sets in cooperation with                the other investigators cooperating in this project.",
