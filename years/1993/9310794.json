 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of American racial attitudes through 1993, building             on earlier research published in the book, Racial Attitudes in                  America: Trends and Interpretations, which charted these trends                 through 1983.  It will analyze them in more recent data sets such               as the 1992 National Election Study, the 1993 General Social                    Survey, and the most recent, relevant Gallup survey.  Contemporary              racial issues will be included, and the project will incorporate                new empirical and theoretical work that will enrich the                         interpretations of important relationships between change in racial             attitudes and other variables, such as age, attitudes toward                    government enforcement, and the effects of social desirability on               the validity of self-reported opinion.                                                                                                                          This research will contribute significantly to the field of race                and ethnic relations, one of the intellectually most important                  areas of sociology with the greatest significance for American                  social policy.  The original book was very influential with both                scholars and educated non-academic readers, and the addition of a               decade of data and theoretical insights will be a substantial                   contribution to the knowledge base for understanding one of the                 most difficult social problems in the United States.",
