 "awd_abstract_narration": "de Branges  9303367       This project continues mathematical research on problems in  complex analysis and the application of methods of factorization  of entire functions to attempt a resolution of the Riemann  Hypothesis.  This venerable conjecture concerns the roots of the  so-called Riemann zeta-function.  This an important function in  number theory which itself is not entire (having a pole at the  number 1).  It is believed to have roots along the line  perpendicular to real axis passing through 1/2.  Often forgotten  is the fact that this function also has roots at the negative  even integers.  The factorization theory employed here derives  from the spectral theory of self-adjoint second order  differential operators.  Hilbert himself conjectured that the  spectral theory contains a proof of the Riemann hypothesis.  This  theory in itself does not contain enough information about roots  along the critical line.  Work will be done in developing another  spectral theory for the purposes at hand.  Factorization theory  in effect replaces the classical Euler product representation of  the zeta-function with two-by-two matrices whose entries are  entire functions.  The elementary factors of the reciprocal of  the Euler product are recovered from the determinants of the  matrices.         The search for an answer to the question of the roots of  the Riemann zeta-function has a rich history, in which  fundamental mathematical ideas and structures evolved and a  gained life of their own.  This project, whether or not it  completes the search, will undoubtedly continue in this tradition  whereby the products of the research may prove to be more  valuable the goal itself.  ***",
