 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since                      plastic packaging accounts for approximately 20 per cent in                     volume of the solid waste, recycling plastics will play a                       significant role in reducing the volume of solid waste to the                   landfills of decreasing number and space in the nation.                         Students must be educated in the methods to recycle materials                   in order to reduce future waste. This project is intended to                    improve materials laboratory instruction for major and non-                     major undergraduates by presenting a series of typical plastics                 recycling experiments, including collecting, grinding,                          processing, testing and analyzing of recycled plastics. The                     requested equipment includes a plastics granulator, an                          extruder, an optical microscope and a plastics hardness tester.                 These instruments and equipment are typical of those used in                    the recycling, quality control and property identification of                   plastics. The theoretical and practical experience in materials                 recycling will give students knowledgeable insight in reducing                  solid waste, conserving natural resources and protecting the                    environment. This project could serve as a model for                            undergraduate institutions in the nation for creating an                        understanding of the effect and need of recycling materials for                 the conservation of our environment and natural resources.",
