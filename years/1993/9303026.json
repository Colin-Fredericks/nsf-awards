 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted on the circulation of Arctic Ocean water             masses and will be carried out under the auspices of the ARCSS/OAII             global change research program.  This work will investigate the                 input of shelf water from the Barents, Kara, and Laptev seas of the             Arctic Ocean into the subsurface water masses of the Eurasian Basin             and investigate the circulation of these subsurface water masses                along the continental slope in this region.  These objectives will              be met by measuring anthropogenic halocarbons on samples collected              during the summer and autumn 1993 cruise of the German Research                 icebreaker POLARSTERN.   Shelf waters will have a relatively high               anthropogenic halocarbon signal because they interact extensively               with the atmosphere.  The halocarbon distributions will be used to              determine locations of shelf water inflow, to investigate formation             of subsurface water masses in the Eurasian Basin by mixing between              shelf waters and deep water, and to investigate the transport of                newly formed subsurface water masses in the deep cyclonic boundary              current that has been postulated to flow around the Eurasian Basin.             This work will be carried out in conjunction with several German                investigators.  The research objectives address the ARCSS research              priority area of Circulation of the Arctic Ocean.",
