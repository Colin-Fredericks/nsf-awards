A total of  ten educational institutions throughout New England are  represented.    Five specific research projects of biomedical emphasis and  three of physico-chemical emphasis are proposed, as well as  a number of secondary projects. The major users propose  studies of:    the structure and mechanism of action of lysyl oxidase and  related copper-containing amine oxidases;  the structures and mechanisms regulating selection and  transfer of fragments of antigenic proteins into the antigen-  binding sites of major histocompatibility complex molecules;  the improvement of EPR dosimetric techniques with emphasis  on the use of bone marrow and bone fragments as in situ  dosimeters;  the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase-mediated mechanisms of  toxicity of chlorocarbons;  the effects of metal-binding in the neurochemically-  important protein calmodulin on conformation and  interactions with intracellular target enzymes and inhibitor  proteins;  the low-temperature magnetic properties of transparent  bimetallic layered ferrimagnetic systems;  the nature of the radical sulfur species present in aqueous  solutions and at electrode surfaces;  quantum effects n linear antiferromagnetic chains.",
