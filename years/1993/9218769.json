 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to understand how compressed                   fluids influence polymer morphology based on molecular                          interactions and phase behavior.  Many different polymers can                   be prepared into various physical forms through a variety of                    processes using compressed or supercritical fluids.                             Structures include microspheres, fibers, and foams as well as                   more unusual forms.  Theoretical and experimental                               thermodynamic studies are planned to examine polymer                            morphologies and processes with compressed fluids.  One part                    of the project involves determining the effect of CO2 on glass                  transition temperature with supercritical fluid                                 chromatography.  A prediction of retrograde vitrification of                    glassy polymer, based on lattice fluid theory and the Gibbs-                    DiMarzio criterion for CO2 sorption and Tg, will be tested.                                                                                                     Polymers are versatile materials which are widely utilized in                   many commercial products.  New physical forms can improve                       performance and quality in existing applications or create new                  uses.  Applications anticipated for these materials range from                  new polymeric membranes and chromatographic packings for                        separations to lightweight structural components or even a                      matrix for artificial skin.***//",
