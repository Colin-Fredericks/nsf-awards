 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is upgrading the laboratory component of optics by                 introducing current instrumentation related to setting up and                   testing erbium-doped fiber optical amplifiers and distributed                   feedback lasers.  Students are characterizing the output of a                   distributed feedback laser by measuring it output power,                        linearity, central wavelength, and spectral width using power                   meters, monochromators, and scanning interferometers.  They are                 assembling and testing an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA)                   system.  Using a leveled sine-wave generator as a driving                       source or an LED and a DFB laser, appropriate detector and a                    wide bandwidth oscilloscope, they are measuring amplification                   and linearity of the EDFA for a range of signal strengths.                      They are also measuring bit error rate using a BERT driving a                   DFB laser source, sending a signal through a length of fiber                    with and without amplification by an EDFA.  Finally, they are                   using two DFB lasers as sources to make a narrowly-spaced (in                   wavelength) wavelength division multiplexer which inputs its                    signal to an EDFA before the demultiplexing stage.  All                         instruments are representative of those which a technician                      working with fiber optics uses.",
