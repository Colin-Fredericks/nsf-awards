 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352301  Craig       Design of Mechatronic Systems is the proposed senior-elective  course and laboratory for mechanical engineering  undergraduates. It builds on the current successful course,  Mechatronics, and focuses on mechatronic design. With the  support of industrial sponsors - real customers- student design  teams will design, build, and test a microprocessor-based  mechatronic system to satisfy the customer defined  problem/need.Funds are requested for course development and for  laboratory equipment. Course development will focus on  microprocessor instruction, the design process taught by  example, and design practice taught by scheduled written and  oral presentations, culminating with a prototype. The  testing/debugging equipment requested here is essential for  successful microprocessor-based design. They, together with the  current inventory of sensors, actuators, computers, and  microprocessors in the Mechatronics Laboratory, and the  project-specific equipment supplied by the industrial customer,  will give the student design teams all the tools necessary to  learn good mechatronic design methodology by experience and  produce winning designs.This course sequence represents the one  of the first known offerings in mechatronics at the  undergraduate level.  Aspects of course will also be modified  for collaborative use within the curriculum of Hudson Valley  Community College via instructor tutorials, transferred  laboratory and experimental procedures, shared resources and  student interaction.  Furthermore, the course and its  associated laboratory equipment will be used to attract 7th-  10th grade precollege students, especially women and  minorities, to engineering.  ***",
