It will allow for the  determination of the plasmon dispersion, their lifetimes and  coupling between neighboring lateral wires that are vital to an  understanding of the electronic properties of quantum wires.  In  addition, the effects of electron-electron interactions on the spin  wave dynamics and elastic stability of bulk 3d ferromagnets will be  investigated through light scattering studies on a novel set of  Fe1-xCox epilayers.  This will provide important data on the  interplay between electron correlations and elastic stability, a  connection that has surfaced in recent year.  %%%  This project will support a laser spectroscopic study of charge  carriers in ultra-narrow channels a few hundredths of a micron wide  that underlie the next generation of high speed electronic devices.  The study focusses on the collective response of carriers within  individual channels as well as their coupling to neighboring  lateral wires.  In addition, the effects ofinteractions between  charge carriers, that present one of the greatest challenges to  understanding magnetism in metallic materials, will be addressed.   This will be investigated through optical spectroscopy and varying  the strength of the electron interactions made possible by a recent  breakthrough in alloying different magnetic elements.  ***",
