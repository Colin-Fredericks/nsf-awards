 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310667  Hellman  How much of the apparatus of modern mathematics is really needed  for its applications in contemporary science, especially physics?   Could some smaller subset of contemporary mathematics (some of  these alternatives are finitism, constructivism, intuitionism, or  predicativism).  This is the central question which Professor  Hellman is addressing.  He is further developing and extending his  ongoing work on the question of the scientific indispensability of  classical infinitistic (i.e. \"non-constructive\") mathematics and on  the question of the significance of such indispensability for the  philosophy of mathematics.  The first part of his project focuses  on constructivist programs, one of the groups of alternatives to  classical mathematics, and their capacity to recover empirically  significant portions of mathematics employed in the physical  sciences that appear to pose special challenges, especially the  calculus of variations and the singularity theorems (Hawking and  Penrose) of space-time physics.  The second part concerns  philosophically interesting intermediary systems falling \"between\"  (in special senses) constructivist and full classical systems,  especially the quasi-constructivism known as predicativism  (originating with Poincare and Weyl) and certain nominalistic  systems.  He is examining both scientific and mathematical-  philosophical challenges to predicativism  with the aim of  assessing predicativism's viability as a foundational framework for  mathematics.   Finally, in the third part of his study,  Professor  Hellman is beginning to assess the overall scope and force of  \"indispensability\" arguments (as justification for abstract  mathematics) in light of results of his earlier work and also in  light of recent challenges to the effectiveness and cogency of such  arguments.  ***",
