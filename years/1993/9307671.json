 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with research on motives and motivic             cohomology.  The principal investigator will continue his research              in the various properties of his new definitions of motives and                 notivic cohomology.  Given any quasiprojective scheme X over an                 algebraically closed field k, the Suslin complex of X should give               the mixed motive of X as an object in the derived category of                   abelian groups.  The principal investigator has already shown that              this is a very natural definition for X an arbitrary curve over k,              and he will investigate the case of surfaces.  In addition, he will             investigate the extent to which his generalized definition of the               Suslin complex can be shown to satisfy the desired axioms.                           This research is concerned with algebraic K-theory.  In a                  broad sense algebraic K-theory concerns th evolution of concepts                from linear algebra such as basis and vector space.  This work has              significant implications for number theory and algebraic geometry,              and promises to make exciting connections between a number of                   different areas in mathematics.",
