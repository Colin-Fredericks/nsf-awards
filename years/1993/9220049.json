 "awd_abstract_narration": "Having confirmed the eclectic nature and presence of                       eolian additions in a classical lateritic regolith  in                          Australia, we request renewal of this funding for continued                     study off continental weathering systems.  We seek to make                      more new applications of unique microbeam capabilities of                       the SHRIMP (sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe) to                        surface process studies centering on the provenance,                            surficial transport and in situ weathering behavior of                          zircon, a chemically resistant and datable pathfinder                           mineral of unparalleled utility.  We wish to define ancient                     eolian dispersal patterns and mineralogical gradients of                        dust-size weathering product and insoluble detrital                             accessory minerals across the tectonically-stable Yilgarn                       craton of  Western Australia.  Our study will focus on                          sampling a sequence of uneroded laterites in an easterly                        transect leading away from the principal source region which                    we infer to have contributed foreign zircon to the                              Jarrahdale bauxite near Perth Australia by paleo-eolian                         processes.  In the 700 Ma Leeuwin Block of the Pinjarra                         Orogen source region, we wish to study the accessory mineral                    suite (zircon, rutile, monazite and ilmenite) in bedrock                        granite, granulite and anorthosite exposures and date the                       zircons.  Also, by dating eolian zircons in contemporary                        dust samples collected from rain gauge arrays, we can                           ascertain if source regions have shifted significantly.                         Finally, we wish to study the mineralogical and isotopic                        processes of in situ weathering of parent material zircon                       and to pursue direct SHRIMP dating of authigenic anatase.                       We wish to test their use in characterizing and timing the                      advance of the weathering front and biomechanical admixing                      rate of detritus into the subsurface thereby augmenting the                     array of geochronological methods available for surficial                       process studies.",
