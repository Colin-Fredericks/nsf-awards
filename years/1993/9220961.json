 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corrosion conditions affect a wide range of industries.  In                oil industry, the main cause of pipeline fractures is corrosion.                Generally speaking, it is not economic to separate the oil and gas              and transport them in different pipelines.   In the oil industry,               the oil and gas, together with carbon dioxide and brine which are               used in enhanced oil recovery methods, are flowed together in one               large diameter pipeline.  These multiphase flows have very                      different characteristics than single phase flows.  Planning                    activities at Ohio University and the University of Illinois have               developed an industry based research Center program in                          investigating the corrosion in multiphase systems.                                   The formation of this Center is based on the early work                    supported by some oil/gas and animal farm building industries .                 The proposed Center program is to develop an integration of                     industry, Ohio University, and the University of Illinois based on              the NSF I/UCRC model.                                                                The initial research agenda of Ohio University/University of               Illinois's Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for                  Corrosion in Multiphase System will address the following topics:               1) Corrosion in Oil and Gas Pipelines, 2) Corrosion in Animal and               Plant Confinement Facilities, and 3) Bacterial/Microbial Corrosion.                  Currently, there are fifteen company sponsors for the Center               (ten companies in the research group at Ohio University and five                companies in the research group at the University of Illinois)                  committing approximately $365,000/year.                                              The Principal Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues              at Ohio University and the University of Illinois have the                      knowledge and facilities to run this Center.                                         The Program Manager recommends Ohio University and the                     University of Illinois be awarded $100,000 for the first year of a              five-year continuing award.   The continueing award for the                     University of Illinois will be based on the significant growth of               the industrial support in the end of the first year.                                 Near the end of the first year the Program Director will                   review the progress of the Center on a number of criteria,                      including the following: 1) the extent to which the university-                 industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to which the                  support  base is developing; 3) the extent to which a robust                    research program is developing.  If the review is satisfactory, the             Program Director will recommend support for the next period of this             continuing award.",
