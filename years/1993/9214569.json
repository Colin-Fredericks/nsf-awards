 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doctors Gray and Winkler of CalTech will investigate the                        photochemistry of modified metalloenzymes with support from the                 Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the                      Chemistry Division and the Biophysics Program of the Molecular                  and Biochemical Sciences Division.  These workers will combine                  methods and systems from inorganic chemistry, physical                          chemistry, and molecular biology to custom design light-driven                  multielectron redox enzymes.  They will photoinitiate                           single-electron-transfer reactions that will result in                          formation of oxo-iron (ferryl) species in variants of                           cytochrome c and myoglobin.  These proteins will be tailored                    for ferryl formation by use of semisynthetic and site-directed                  mutagenesis techniques.  Histidine residues for ruthenium                       binding will be introduced at surface sites on the proteins,                    and alterations in the protein heme environments will adapt the                 protein to support ferryl species in the active sites.  Upon                    photolysis, electron transfer between the ruthemium and heme                    moieties will lead to ferryl formation.                                         %%%                                                                             An important intermediate species in many reactions of dioxygen                 that are catalyzed by heme proteins is one that contains the                    iron atom of the heme bound to an oxygen atom.  These \"ferryl\"                  species in the past have proven difficult to characterize                       because of their high reactivity.  A novel and powerful method                  to generate and detect them will be developed that depends                      first on using methods of molecular biology to engineer the                     proteins so as to facilitate electron transfer reactions that                   can be driven by a short flash of laser light.  The ferryl                      species will then be detected by use of their optical                           properties, and information on their reactivity will be                         obtained directly.",
