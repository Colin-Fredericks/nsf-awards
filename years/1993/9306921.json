 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306921  Bloomfield  This research planning grant for women supports studies exploring  the potential role of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) in  mediating the response of bone to changes in mechanical strain.   Previous investigators have developed valuable animal models to  quantify and describe in detail the nature of the bony response to  increases in loading experienced by bone, as well as to the  decreased loading of various immobilization treatments.  Little is  known, however, about cellular or molecular mechanisms for the  subsequent gain or loss in bone volume routinely observed with  these conditions.  Specifically, how do bone cells perceive strain  and then transduce that mechanical signal to a biochemical factor  which then initiates increases in bone formation activity (in the  case of increased loading) or suppresses formation in favor of  resorption (in the case of decreased loading)?    The planning activities of this proposal will provide training in  two primary tools essential to this line of research: bone  histomorphometry and molecular biology techniques to isolate and  quantify mRNA for IGFs from bone tissue.    ***",
