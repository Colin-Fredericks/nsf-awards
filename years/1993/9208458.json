The                      extent to which the laser field can be used as a probe of the                   dynamics of a collinear reaction is being studied with regard                   to variation in the laser intensity, field frequency,                           polarization, collision energy, internal energy, and other                      factors. Complications such as rotating wave breakdown and                      multi-electronic surface effects are being considered.                          %%%                                                                             A major current problem in chemical physics is to obtain                        greater understanding of what actually happens during the                       course of a chemical reaction, i.e., during the short time in                   which reacting molecules approach each other, pass through an                   intermediate transition stage, and separate as products.  This                  project is a theoretical investigation to determine how laser                   probes can be used to provide information during this brief                     period.",
