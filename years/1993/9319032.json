 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319032  Lakowicz  Stationary and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy are  widely used in Biochemistry and Biophysics.  The  information content  of the data is determined by the many  lifetime of  the excited state, which determines the time  available for dynamic processes to affect the emission  spectral parameters.  We propose to evaluate the use of  \"light quenching\" upon illumination of the samples with  long-wavelength non-absorbed light, to alter the decay  times and photoselected orientation of the excited state  population.   In this exploratory project we will evaluate  the prospects for light quenching using modern laser  sources, as applied to steady-state, time-domain and  frequency-domain measurements.  We propose the following  goals:    1. Determine the extent of  light quenching obtainable with  fluorophores commonly present in proteins, membranes and  nucleic acids.    2. Evaluate the use of light quenching and steady-state  fluorescence measurements based on the principle of  \"lifetime-resolved\" emission spectra and anisotropy decays.    3. Evaluate the use of light quenching to modify the  orientation of the photoselected population, with emphasis  on optical geometries which can generate oriented (non-  symmetric) excited state populations.    4. Develop the appropriate theoretical expressions and  software for light quenching for one - and two - beam  populations.    5. Examine light quenching of sensing probes, such as those  used for Ca2+, pH and CI-, to determine the prospect for  lifetime-resolved imaging in fluorescence microscopy, via  light quenching.    Light quenching offers a non-perturbing means of  controlling the excited state population and orientation  without the addition of chemical quenchers.  Also, light  quenching is rapidly reversible.  This phenomena may have  many unforeseen future applications, not only in steady-  state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, but also  in fluorescence microscopy and imaging.",
