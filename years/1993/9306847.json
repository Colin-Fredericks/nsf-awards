 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pattern of expression of two extracellular matrix proteins,                 tenascin and thrombospondin, is being examined during craniofacial              development in mammals.  These proteins are thought to be                       significant in musculosketetal development, in the process of                   ossification, in the establishment of connective tissue patterning,             as well as in a number of other developmental events.  Two model                systems -- mice and the mini-opossum, Monodelphis domestica -- will             be used to test these hypotheses.  Specific studies include: the                use of PCR cloning techniques to contruct a marsupial cDNA probe to             tenascin; the use of these probes to map the spatial and temporal               expression of tenascin in cranial skeletal tissues in the                       developing marsupial neonate; the comparison of the pattern of                  expression in Monodelphis with that in mice; the collection of                  pilot data for a future study involving the experimental                        manipulation of matrix gene expression in vivo by application of                exogenous growth factors; and the mapping of expression of                      thrombospondin in time and space in mic embryos.                                                                                                                This project is significant for a number of reasons.  First, it                 will allow an examination of the processes involved in normal                   craniofacial development and may help illuminate the significance               of two molecules thought to be of general significance in                       development.  Second, it will make use of a new model for mammalian             development, Monodelphis domestica, in which most development                   occurs after birth.  Additionally, these studies will allow                     exploration of the molecular basis of heterochronies observed in                marsupial and placental mammal development.  Finally, in line with              the goals of the Career Advancement Award, this project will                    provide the opportunity to extend previous research into entirely               new directions.",
