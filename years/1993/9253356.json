 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Boulder Valley Project will expand the uses and support                     of the Internet throughout the Boulder Valley School                            District, Boulder, Colorado, over a three year period.                          Through concentrating on horizontal infusion into three                         middle schools and vertical infusion onto one elementary,                       one middle and one senior high school in a feeder pattern,                      the training and development will be maximized.  The                            teachers directly trained will become peer instructors.                         Ultimately, over two-hundred and fifty-eight teacher and                        administrators will be trained and have access to the                           Internet including all building principals.                                                                                                                     The project has three distinct stages.  In the first, a core                    group of teachers who will later become peer instructors is                     trained on the Internet including e-mail and access to                          files.  In the second stage, the network is used as a                           practical way to induce students to internalize a foreign                       language.  In the third stage, connectivity and training are                    spread throughout the district.  Curriculum development of                      lessons which employ the network is done and disseminated.                                                                                                      The university and partners cost share 40% of this project.",
