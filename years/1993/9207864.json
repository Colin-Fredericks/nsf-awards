 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant is to study the solar wind near the sun using a                 variety of radio propagation methods.  The results of this \"radio               probing\" will be compared with other ground-based coronal                       observations and with in-situ observations from space-craft.  The               basic objectives are to understand the mechanism(s) of coronal                  heating and of solar wind acceleration, and the relationship                    between large scale photospheric structures and large scale solar               wind structures.  Ultimately, such understanding is necessary to                understand the coupling between the sun and the earth, enabling us              to understand and even to predict conditions in the space                       environment around the earth.                                                        The radio-remote-sensing observations detect the results of                phase modulation of radio waves passing through the solar wind in               various ways.  This phase modulation is linearly proportional to                the electron density.  Thus one observed the effects of electron                density fluctuations.  The simplest observation is to measure the               solar wind velocity.  However, the velocity is not the only                     information one can derive.  One can also estimate the spatial                  spectrum of these density fluctuations and how they are couples to              velocity fluctuations.  One can see the effects of plasma waves in              these observations and test their consistency with theoretical wave             spectra.  One could use these methods to provide ground-based                   support for the ULYSSES polar-orbiting space-craft.  The ULYSSES                mission will provide perhaps the only opportunity to directly                   observe the solar poles in this generation.                                     #",
