 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307171  Faust       Aqueous-phase reactions of hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) and  hydroxyl radical (OH) in atmospheric water drops play crucial roles  in the chemistry of the troposphere, yet knowledge of the sources  of these oxidants to the water drops is incomplete.   While gas-to-  drop partitioning of HOOH and OH has received much study,  comparatively little attention has been focussed on aqueous-phase  photochemical reactions as sources of these oxidants to atmospheric  water drops.       The objectives of this research are: (a) determination of  quantum yields and sunlight rates of HOOH and OH photo-formation in  authentic cloud and fog waters collected over several years from  several locations, (b) determination of the seasonal dependence of  HOOH and OH photo-formation, (c) comparisons of the relative  importance of aqueous-phase photochemistry versus gas-to-drop  partitioning as sources of HOOH and OH to atmospheric water drops,  (d) to evaluate chemical and Physical parameters of authentic  atmospheric waters as predictors (based on mechanistic  considerations) of the HOOH and OH photo-formation rates and of the  OH lifetime, (e) to determine rates and quantum yields of HOOH  photo-formation from compounds of relevance to cloud and fog  chemistry, and (f) to increase the understanding of mechanisms  responsible for photochemical formation of the oxidants in  authentic atmospheric waters and form the individual compounds.       The project will characterize the photo-formation of HOOH and  OH in authentic cloud and fog waters obtained form several high  elevation sites.  Additionally, survey studies will be carried out  on the HOOH photo-formation form well-defined aqueous solutions of  individual organic compounds.       Overall, the results form this proposal will allow for a more  accurate understanding to the sources of HOOH and OH to cloud and  fog drops.  This will improve our understanding of the atmospheric  chemical cycles of peroxides, sulfur, carbon, iron, and other  elements.   This new knowledge will enhance our predictions of  sulfuric acid and sulfate aerosol formation that affect acid  deposition and the global cooling effect exerted by sulfate  aerosols.",
