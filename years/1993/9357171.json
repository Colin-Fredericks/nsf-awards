 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 9357171  PI: Tolman    Professor Tolman, of the University of Minnesota, will  investigate the transition metal coordination compounds  with the assistance of an NSF Young Investigator Award  from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program.  His research program is focussed on  two subjects, which are linked by their use of pyrazolyl  ligands.  One of the projects will use these ligands to  prepare copper compounds that can interact with  oxonitrogen compounds such as NO; the objective is to use  simple coordination chemistry to enhance our  understanding of the role of copper in enzymatic  denitrification.  The other project will use chiral  versions of these ligands to bind metal ions in a chiral  3-fold environment; it is anticipated that such metal  centers will be able to mediate stereoselective reactions  in ways that differ significantly from the more usual  chiral 2-fold metal centers.  %%%  The presence of metal ions in molecules can endow these  molecules with unusual properties.  A real-world example  is found in certain bacterial enzymes, where copper ions  lead to the conversion of nitrite to gases such as N2;  this particular reaction is a major component of the  global nitrogen cycle.  The underlying chemistry of  copper-nitrogen compounds is presently very poorly  understood.  With this grant, simple molecules containing  copper and various nitrogenous components will be  prepared, and their reactions will be studied.  Another  example of unusual metal ion behavior is the ability of  molecules containing metal ions to have the property of  chirality (i.e., handedness), and thereby to catalyze  important reactions to give only one of a variety of  possible products.  This grant will enable studies of  such systems where the chirality is based on a three-fold  symmetry about the metal ion, rather than the more  unusual two-fold symmetry.  It is expected that this  change of symmetry will lead to substantial differences  in catalytic activity, poten tially of industrial benefit.",
