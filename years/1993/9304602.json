Recently, I have been successful in generating a germline null L-  myc mutant mouse derived from gene targeting and embryonic stem  cell methodology.  The working hypothesis is that since myc-family  gene expression changes at key development transitions in cultured  cells and in the organism, absent L-myc expression will lead to the  aberrant expression of phenotypic markers of differentiation.  In  this proposal, questions concerning the role of L-myc in  differentiation and growth control are addressed in vitro using  cell culture systems and during development in vivo using  homozygous null L-myc mutant embryonic stem cell lines and a null  L-myc mouse mutant.  Changes in L-myc expression at key  developmental transitions would lead to altered morphology in the  developing or adult mouse, or to changes in the expression of genes  regulated by L-myc.  The phenotype of the null L-myc mutant mouse  will be characterized.  Experiments will be performed to test the  hypothesis that L-myc is an essential gene during embryonic  development.  Heterozygous null L-myc mice will be mated to each  other and the offspring will be genotyped.  If no homozygous null  L-myc mutant mice are born, embryos will be harvested at different  gestational stages and be prepared for histological examination.   In this specific aim, the goal is to identify changes in morphology  in developing tissues and organ systems by histological analysis.   In order to characterize further the expression pattern of the c-,  N- and L-myc genes in early embryonic development, the expression  of L-myc will be examined in the earliest differentiation event in  the mouse embryo:  the formation of trophectoderm and inner cell  mass.  Blastocyst and later developmental stages will also be  examined by in situ hybridization.  The earliest time in  development at which myc genes are expressed i n a cell type  specific manner will be identified.  Another important outcome will  be the potential correlation of the phenotype with the expression  pattern of L-myc.  The goal of this section is to identify and  examine changes in L-myc expression in developing tissues in order  to identify changes in the expression of gene products in the  absence of L-myc expression in the null mutant.  The  characterization of L-myc gene expression and phenotype of a null  L-myc mouse will lead to a significant advancement in our  understanding of myc gene biology.  ***",
