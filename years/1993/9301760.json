 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of ecosystem modeling at regional and                         larger scales hinges on both the quality of the science                         underlying model formulation and the quality of the                             information system.  This award will support the development                    of an object-oriented Ecosystem Information System (EIS)                        that addresses four key problems that plague large modeling                     efforts:  (1) separation of the logical attribute of data                       sources from their implementation detail: (2) identification                    of key similarities and differences between different                           sources; (3) maintenance of numerous, large data set                            instances from various sources; and (4) maintenance of                          consistency in data set usage by simulation systems that                        combine inputs from a variety of sources.  EIS development                      will included the active participation of both information                      systems and ecosystem modeling specialists.  EIS will                           include two major components:  a software support system and                    a collection of ecosystem research components implemented in                    (i.e., converted to) the object-oriented paradigm.  The EIS                     software will be a robust distributed system that provides                      users in separate laboratories access to a common                               information resource.  The research components to be                            implemented within EIS include important \"public\" data                          layers (e.g. soils, elevation, remote-sensed imagery),                          unique data layers derived through our research (e.g.,                          climate hydrology, land cover), and locally developed                           simulation components that produce and analyze various data                     layers.  The object-oriented paradigm supported by EIS will                     be readily extensible, allowing users to easily add new data                    sources (object classes), data set design and implementation                    will provide not only an example of how to build information                    systems to facilitate user access, but also permit                              researchers in a variety of biological disciplines to access                    an important collection of ecosystem components.  This award                    is jointly supported by the Database Activities in the                          Biological Sciences and Ecological Studies programs.",
