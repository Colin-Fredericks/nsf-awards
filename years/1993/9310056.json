 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigation focuses on the interrelationship                    between public opinion and policy over time.  While a lot is known              about whether public opinion influences policy, little is known                 about whether the public is itself responsive to policy behavior,               adjusting its preferences for policy activity in response to what               policymakers acutally do.  A responsive public would effectively                behave like a thermostat, where a deaprture from the favored policy             temperature produces a signal to adjust policy accordingly and,                 once sufficiently adjusted, the signal stops.                                                                                                                   This research investigation considers whether the public behaves                thermostatically, and relies primarily on statistical analyses of               budgetary policy and public preferences for spending over time,                 across a range of budget opinion domains.  The research addresses               both the influence of public preferences for more spending on                   budgetary policy and the influence of those decisions, in turn, on              public preferences.  Preliminary analysis suggests that there are               strong reciprocal connections between public inputs into the                    policymaking process and the outputs the process generates.  In its             simplest sense, when the public wants more spending it gets more,               and when it gets more it doesn't want as much more.  This research              produces important insights in the public policy/public opinion                 interrelationship.",
