 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports cooperative work between                                    Charles Dalton, University of Houston, and Zhuang                               Lixian, University of Science and Technology,                                   Hefei, China on wake dynamics around a cylinder                                 in oscillatory flows.  This is an important                                     problem, with potential application to                                          understanding offshore wave loading on pile                                     structures. This collaboration involves the                                     strengths and innovation in computational                                       approaches of the Chinese team, and the US PI's                                 experience and accomplishments in prediction of                                 unsteady wakes.  Both countries will benefit from                               further understanding of such phenomena as                                      boundary layer separation, vortex shedding, flow                                instability, wake turbulence, and wake vortex                                   motions due to both induced-velocity and                                        convective effects.  These results may be applied                               to improved design of offshore structures.                                                                                                                      This award provides eighteen months of graduate                                 student support, which will be used to enable the                               participation of a US student.  The Chinese have                                obtained support from the Chinese National                                      Natural Science Foundation.",
