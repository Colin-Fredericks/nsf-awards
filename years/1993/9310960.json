Krishna Murty                                   and Vijay Kumar of the Department of Aerospace                                  Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science                                  in Bangalore, India, and Dr. J.N. Reddy of the                                  Department of Engineering Mechanics at the                                      Virginia Institute of Technology and State                                      University in Blacksburg.  These scientists                                     plan to continue theoretical, analytical                                        studies on the behavior of laminated composite                                  panels under compressive loads.  Specifically,                                  they are seeking to develop analytical tools to                                 describe the process of delamination in such                                    panels. These studies will be also useful in                                    determining residual strength of these plates.                                  The collaborative work will benefit from                                        experimental work being done independently by                                   the Indian team at the I.I.Sc.                                                                                                                                  Scope:  This project provides support to extend                                 collaborative research currently being carried                                  out by the same scientists under an earlier NSF                                 grant.  The work has already provided better                                    understanding of the problem, and resulted in                                   several joint publications.  The project fits                                   well with the objectives of the U.S.-India                                      Cooperative Science Program.",
