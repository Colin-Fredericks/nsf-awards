 "awd_abstract_narration": "9213823  Glinert         This is the second year funding of a three-year continuing award with the objective of developing a  theoretical basis for multimodal interface design.  The basis for the investigation is the interplay  between visual and auditory interface (graphics and sound) issues, and also the temporal and dynamic  aspects of the abstract objects that are active in the interface.  The simultaneous consideration of these  aspects leads to the definition od an object-oriented construct called a  metawidget  which is an  abstract object with built-in strategies which allow multiple different manners of manifesting  themselves to the user.   Among those modes of manifestation are image, sound or even combinations  and sequences of the two media.  The implementation will consist of suitable microworld  environments for experimentation, used as testbeds for controlled experimentation to validate the  theoretical aspects of the interface design process as they are developed.  Prototypes of such  microworlds include an animated editor for planar graphs and an enhanced multimodal interface for  visually impaired - but  not  blind - users.  These examples have been used as a preliminary approach  to test potentially useful ideas.",
