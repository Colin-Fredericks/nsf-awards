 "awd_abstract_narration": "Why are the two sexes different?  The simple answer is steroid                  hormones.  Steroid hormones stimulate cell growth, sexual                       differentiation, and also trigger the expression of sex-typical                 behaviors.  One of their most important targets is the brain.                   Until recently, it was thought that steroids exerted their                      effects directly on gene expression by binding to receptors in                  the cell nucleus.  It has recently become clear that steroids act               through nongenomic mechanisms as well.  These recent findings may               necessitate a \"paradigm shift\" in the way research into                         reproduction is conducted because it seems that the mechanisms of               steroid action are much more complicated than previously thought.               At large scientific meetings, practitioners of various                          disciplines tend to interact with each other and do not                         necessarily become exposed to fast breaking developments that,                  although relevant to their work, involve unfamiliar methods and                 expertise.  The purpose of this conference is to bring molecular                investigators together with behavioral neuroscientists to promote               collaborations that can capitalize on recent advances in our                    understanding of the mechanism of steroid hormone action.",
