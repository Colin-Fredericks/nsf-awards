 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ventures In education program is built on a successful                      twelve-year experience of establishing academic rigor in                        poorly performing high schools.  It is based on the                             fundamental premise that all children can master a rigorous                     curriculum--one that provides adequate preparation for careers                  in a high technology society.                                                                                                                                   Ventures will work with seventy economically disadvantaged                      senior and junior high schools in five geographic locations,                    to implement school-wide an academically rigorous, science-                     intensive course of study.  (The students enrolled in these                     schools are from minority and economically disadvantaged                        backgrounds.)  A comprehensive approach will be employed                        attending both to the content of the science and mathematics                    courses, and to the development of the academic skills                          underlying successful performance.  An extensive program of                     teacher enhancement will include direct in-the classroom                        guidance and assistance.                                                                                                                                        This intellectually demanding curriculum will be supplemented                   by school-based summer programs for entering 9th- and/or 10th-                  graders and a residential college-based summer program for                      rising 11th- and 12th-graders.                                                                                                                                  The participating seventy senior and junior high schools are                    located in Alabama, Arkansas, New York City, Washington, D.C.,                  and on the Navajo Reservation.  When the programs are fully                     implemented, they will enroll a total of 40,000 students and                    will graduate annually 10,000 youngsters.  Each year, of those                  10,000 graduates, 25 percent--or 2,000-3,000 students--will                     have completed a rigorous college preparatory program,                          designed to enable them to succeed in college courses                           necessary for careers in science, engineering or mathematics.                   Most of these students will be from minority groups that                        currently are under-represented in the scientific labor force.                  Thus, Ventures will significantly advance the NSF objective of                  reducing, or eliminating, the gap in minority science                           participation before the year 2000.                                                                                                                             In addition to providing an excellent education to thousands                    of America's future scientists, the project seeks to seed a                     national model which will move the public schools from the                      current phase of failure and frustration to one of solid                        academic success.  By institutionalizing rigorous science                       curricula in seventy schools in five geographically and                         ethnically diverse sites, Ventures intends to crystalize the                    reform agenda around the issues of academic rigor and                           excellence for all students.",
