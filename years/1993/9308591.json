It is a project                    to  study  gender  differences in small business  ownership.                    The  researcher will conduct qualitative fieldwork among  36                    small  firms  and construct a sampling frame and  pretest  a                    survey  instrument  for  a  planned  future  survey   of   a                    representative sample of 1200-1400 small business owners  in                    the Albany, NY, area.  The focus of the research will be  on                    gender  differences in selection into small business careers                    and in the ways in which family-work conflicts are handled.                           This  award  will initiate research which should  shed                    important  light  on sexual differences  in  small  business                    entrepreneurship.   This is a topic of  considerable  policy                    importance, insofar as it may lead to new information  about                    the  obstacles  to  small business success  for  women.   In                    addition  to  the scientific gains and social importance  of                    this research, this award will materially assist a promising                    young  researcher  to prepare for a larger project,  thereby                    contributing  to the strengthening of the national  base  of                    women scientists and engineers.",
