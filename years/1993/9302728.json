 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research focusing on                      holomorphic dynamical systems in the plane, exploiting the                      interaction between classical function theory and ergodic theory.               Particular emphasis is placed on thermodynamical formalism.  Such               systems are given by holomorphic functions defined in                           neighborhoods of compact sets defined to be the infinite past                   history of the neighborhood.   Of the three objects of this work,               the first is to establish the singularity of harmonic measure on                the compact set with respect to one-dimensional Hausdorff                       measure.  The second objective is finding the description of                    those cases where the harmonic measure is equivalent to the                     measure of maximal entropy.  The third goal is to investigate the               rigidity of harmonic measure in the sense that if two holomophic                dynamical systems are quasiconformally conjugate with equivalent                measures, can one determine if they are actually conformally                    conjugate?                                                                           All of these problems have their roots in potential theory,                combining probabilisitic and ergodic theoretic techniques.                      The research is related to analysis of fractal sets, since the                  most interesting compact sets formed by the infinite past                       of holomorphic functions are often of this type.",
