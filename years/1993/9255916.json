 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Clark Atlanta University program seeks to provide                          intellectually challenging experiences in classroom instruction and             hands-on research experiences in the biological sciences and                    chemistry for 30 students entering grades 8-12.  The six-week                   program is for residential and commuting students in a Young                    Scholars Program designed to increase their interest and knowledge              about career opportunities in the mathematical and natural                      sciences.  The participants will also be made aware of the academic             preparation required to pursue these careers through classroom                  instruction, weekly seminars, and field trips.  Participants in                 grades 10-12 will spend 75% of their work day in research                       laboratories as members of on-going research teams consisting of                research professors, graduate and undergraduate students.                       Participants in grades 8 and 9 will enroll in a laboratory-based,               interdisciplinary science course that emphasizes research                       methodology, problem solving and critical thinking.  Academic year              follow-up activities represent a critical component of the program.",
