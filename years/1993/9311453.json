 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful experimental                  system whose potential for computational neuroscience is largely                untapped.  The simplicity of its nervous system, with exactly 302               neurons in the adult hermaphrodite, and the existence of a complete             anatomical wiring diagram, raise the prospect of a biophysically                accurate model of the entire nervous system.  Although detailed                 genetic analyses and laser ablation studies have delineated the                 circuits necessary for most C. elegans behaviors, it has not been               possible to record from the nervous system.  Thus, how these                    circuits function is not known.  The main objective of this                     project, therefore, is to expand upon pilot studies indicating the              feasibility of making intracellular recordings from C. elegans                  muscles and neurons.                                                                                                                                            One of the main obstacles to recording from C. elegans is the thick             external cuticle that breaks conventional microelectrodes.  Initial             experiments show, however, that the cuticle can be penetrated with              electrodes pulled from quartz glass and that dye-fills can be made              of a variety of muscles.  The fills are long-lasting and reflect                the morphology of anatomically defined muscles in the body wall and             other structures.  This sets the stage for attempts to refine this              technique for making intracellular recordings from muscles.                                                                                                     The small size of C. elegans neurons (2 mm in diameter) make it                 unlikely that sharp electrodes can be used to make intracellular                recordings.  A physiological preparation has been developed,                    therefore, in which neurons are exposed by a microdissection                    technique in which a small slit is made in the cuticle.  Gigaohm                seals (5-20 G) can readily be obtained on the cell bodies of                    exposed neurons and a variety of single channel currents observed               in cell-attached patches.  This study will attempt to make                      intracellular recordings from C. elegans neurons in the whole-cell              patch configuration.  Whole-cell recordings will be established by              mechanical disruption of the membrane patch or by the perforated                patch technique.                                                                                                                                                Data from the recordings will form the basis of detailed                        biophysical models of the circuits underlying locomotion and                    chemotaxis.  Measurement of intrinsic properties such as resting                potential, input resistance, and active currents will be used to                construct biophysically realistic single-neuron models.  Single-                neuron models will be assembled into circuits as defined by                     previous studies and the models tested by comparing the effects of              \"ablating\" neurons in the model and actual circuits.  These models              constitute the initial phase of a long-term effort to understand                the neural basis of behavior of a single organism in its                        entirety.***//",
