 "awd_abstract_narration": "9300134 Turner          The objectives of this research are to develop a sound base  of science and technology for the variational analysis of designs using solid assembly models, and to  contribute to the technology transfer of these ideas into industrial practice.  The major research goals are:  exploitation of solid assembly models so that designer interaction is minimized; accurate computational mathematization of the geometric tolerances described in the ANSI tolerancing standard; development of explicit statistical (process) models as a formal way ofd capturing and utilizing process information; technology transfer into industrial practice through CAD integration.  This research addresses nonlinear statistical tolerance analysis, tolerance synthesis, and tolerance representation.          Advances in design automation technologies for variational analysis can make a major contribution to the competitiveness of American manufacturing industries.  These research efforts will establish a sound modern basis for the development of software technologies that can make an important contribution to the competitiveness of American manufacturing industries.  Product models based on solid modeling technology are rapidly achieving acceptance, and geometric tolerances are now a national standard.  Improved software technologies which incorporate variational analysis capabilities into the product design process, will provide American industry with the ability to develop higher quality products, at lower costs, and with reduced product development time. ***",
