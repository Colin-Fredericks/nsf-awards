The effort invites them  to participate in a program of science research internships, seminars, discussion groups, peer  mentoring with upper division women in science, industrial site visits, and a regular electronic  newsletter that provides project cohesiveness.  The overall goal of the project is to increase the  number of women majoring in the sciences, math, and engineering at Dartmouth.  An  accompanying objective is to effect a general increase in the number of women enrolled in  science and engineering courses, measured by enrollments in classes typically taken by second  and third year students.  This grant will fund a portion of the primary activity of this  comprehensive model project--research internships for first year women.  Research internships  in the natural and physical sciences, math, and engineering offer:  1) an opportunity to work in  scientific research during the first year; 2) one-on-one work with a faculty member, who can  serve as a present and future mentor and role model; 3) \"hands on\" laboratory work and  firsthand experience with scientific inquiry; 4) an important scientific experience complementary  to introductory science classes; 5) an experience which de-mystifies and de-mythologies science;  and 6) stipends to ensure the full participation of economically disadvantaged students.   Objectives for the research internship program during 1993-94 are 1) to maintain the number  of 2-quarter internship opportunities supported per year at approximately 70 and, 2) to evaluate  the internship experience to better articulate and document why and how it operates as an  effective retention strategy within the overall project.      The Women In Science Project represents a very important initiative in hi gher education and  addresses a significant problem, the under-representation of women in the pursuit of science.   The project's research internship offer first-year women an unusual opportunity to experience  the process and methods of scientific inquiry.  The project has been enthusiastically received by  students and faculty, and is readily replicable.  Through careful evaluation and documentation  of the internship process, this strategy can be readied for dissemination.  Research and literature  support the soundness of the project's design.  A comprehensive understanding and  documentation of the value, effectiveness, limitations, and complexity of the internship program  and process, gleaned from the evaluation component, will have three major types of beneficial  outcomes.  First, it will provide information to guide how the internship model might be  improved, revised, and enhanced at Dartmouth.  Second, it will facilitate replication of the  model at other institutions interested in encouraging and sustaining the interest of women in the  sciences.  Third, it will contribute to a knowledge base of what factors and program components  can best support women's participation and retention in the sciences, to assist other research and  implementation efforts in this area.  NSF will support stipends and materials/supplies for 25 of  the 70, 2-quarter research internships that will be offered in academic year 1993-94, an in-depth  evaluation of the internship program, and a portion of the administrative costs of the project  staff.  Internal institutional budgetary support and external support from corporate partners and  foundations will contribute the remaining support for the internship program as well as support  the costs of the other programs within the comprehensive strategy.  ***",
