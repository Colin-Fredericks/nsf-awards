Minority  teachers are especially needed to address the crisis in  educational quality existing in urban communities, particularly  in schools attended by students residing in low-income  public housing.  The Quality Education for Minorities (QEM)  Network will conduct a small Working Conference to:  focus on  the issues, review results of current efforts, and  consider potential designs for a comprehensive and  collaborative strategy to significantly increase the number of  well-prepared minority mathematics and science teachers; and  produce and disseminate a set of written guidelines for  developing a comprehensive strategy.  The 32 participants will  include representatives of two- and four-year colleges and  universities and of middle and junior high schools serving  predominantly minority students bodies; residents of  neighboring low-income public housing served by these  institutions; non-minority institutions with strong teacher  education programs and track records in serving minority  students; and professional educational and scientific  organizations.  ***",
