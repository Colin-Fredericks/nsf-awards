 "awd_abstract_narration": "9398640  Arora  This project addresses the design, implementation and application  of  distributed systems whose input-output relation  is  violated  only  temporarily  when  faults occur. Such  \"nonmasking\"  fault-  tolerance  is often desirable in distributed systems for  reasons  of  efficiency, computability, or application. One  goal  of  the  research  is  to  demonstrate that a  certain  nonmasking  fault-  tolerant  system,  namely a stabilizing reset subsystem,  can  be  implemented  efficiently  and  utilized  effectively  in  a  wide  variety of distributed environments. To this end,         (i) software  will  be  developed that  augments  any  given           distributed system with a stabilizing reset subsystem,              (ii)  tools  will be implemented that measure the efficiency           of nonmasking fault-tolerance, and              (iii)  applications will be demonstrated where the  software           is useful.    Another  goal  of the research is to demonstrate that  nonmasking  fault-tolerant distributed systems can be designed in  a  uniform  and rigorous manner. To this end, methods will be developed for         (i)   system   design   based   on  distributed   constraint          satisfaction,              (ii)  systems  design  based  on stepwise  refinements  that          preserve nonmasking fault-tolerance, and              (iii)  reasoning  about  nonmasking fault-tolerance  in  the          presence of real-time actions and constraints.    The  research will build upon the investigator's prior work on  a  uniform  and  rigorous  framework  for  reasoning  about   fault-  tolerance.  ***",
