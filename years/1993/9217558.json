 "awd_abstract_narration": "The marine geochemistry of rehenium (Re) has attracted interest in              recent years due to its extreme enrichment in reducing relative to              oxygenated sediments and the utility of ReOs geochronometer for                 dating ancient black shales.  Recent work has pointed out the                   essential features of its oceanic behavior, including its long                  residence time and conservative distribution in seawater.  In this              regard, Re is similar to Mo and U in its marine chemistry, all of               which occur as oxo-ions or oxo-ionic complexes in oxic seawater.                All three elements are also enriched in anoxic sediments relative               to oxic sediments, by factors of 500 (for Re) to 5-50 (for Mo and               U).  It appears that Re is not enriched in any other sedimentary                phase.  Recent work has suggested that these elements (as well as               V) may be used as indirect proxies for the redox state of ancient               oceans, or of depositional environments.  These suggestions follow              one of two approaches: the first would utilize the sedimentary                  concentrations of the elements, while the second relies on records              of their seawater concentration contained in foraminiferal calcite.             This research will studt Re in the context of these other elements              to determine whether it may be a useful indicator of                            paleoenvironment using either of the two approaches.  Re                        concentrations will be measured in pore waters and sediments from               a variety of depositional environments, including anoxic basins,                low-oxygen hemipelagic sites, and fully oxygenated hemipelagic                  sites.  The results of this investigation will attempt to answer                basic questions about the mechanism of Re enrichment in anoxic                  sediments and relate Re behavior to environmental parameters.",
