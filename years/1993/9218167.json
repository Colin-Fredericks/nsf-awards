 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in theoretical elementary particle physics will                   extend the understanding of the particles produced at present                   and planned accelerators, including the photon, W and Z                         particles, the electron, \u001a and . and their neutrinos, and                       quarks and gluons.  It will concentrate on the physics                          responsible for the masses of many of these particles.  This                    is the principal unsolved mystery in the standard model of the                  basic forces.  The research will also deepen our understanding                  of quantum field theory, which provides the most useful                         mathematical language for the study of this physics.  This                      language is important in other fields (condensed matter                         physics, for example) as well as in particle physics.  This                     project also will focus on aspects of string theory.  Specific                  areas of inquiry in string theory will include quantum                          gravity, aspects of strings propagating in a space (in                          particular, the study of strings in the context of cosmology                    and black holes), and topological field theories.  String                       theory has been perhaps the most active area of research in                     high energy physics in the past seven years.  Research in                       string theory is very important since string theory is the                      only known fundamental theory which reconciles quantum theory                   with Einstein's theory of gravity.  This project will play an                   important role in the advancement of this subject by studying,                  classifying and unifying various solutions to string theory.                    Finally, the project will investigate the relations of                          elementary particles to objects and processes that cannot be                    directly studied at accelerators, such as the dark matter in                    the universe, black holes produced by gravitational collapse,                   grand unified theories and baryon number production in the                      early history of the universe.",
