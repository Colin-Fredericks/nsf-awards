 "awd_abstract_narration": "From an ecological perspective, some of the most important                 environments in freshwater streams are \"backwaters,\" which                      usually are found at sites where water decelerates, such as at                  the downstream end of a bar or in a partially filled side                       channel.  The character of these backwaters as habitats for fish                and other fauna are strongly influenced by the timing, duration,                and magnitude of flows.  Construction of dams and other flow-                   control devices along streams have serious impacts on flow                      regimes and therefore on sediment transport, rates and forms of                 channel adjustment, and growth of riparian vegetation.  Some                    research has been conducted on how changes in flows affect the                  character of stream channels, but many important questions remain               unanswered.  This doctoral dissertation research project will                   examine a 53-km  reach of the Colorado River in western Colorado                to quantify changes over the last half century in the abundance                 and distribution of backwaters; to correlate these changes with                 changes in water-use, land-use, and precipitation patterns; to                  study flow and sediment transport in backwaters; and to develop a               model of the evolution of backwaters.  The study will consist of                the analysis of information from aerial photographs, public                     records, and field measurements of flow and sediment transport.                      This project will contribute to more general knowledge about               the processes operating within and along streams, thereby                       expanding understanding of how changes in flow affect other                     characteristics of a stream and river dynamics and improving                    capabilities for predicting how proposed changes in flow regimes                will affect habitats downstream.  Because a number of endangered                species occupy backwaters in the study area, this project will                  provide important information to help protect the environments                  occupied by these fish.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement                 award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising               student to establish a strong independent research career.",
