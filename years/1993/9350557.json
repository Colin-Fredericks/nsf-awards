The College has collaborated with four Philadelphia School District Middle Schools for student and staff recruitment.  Each of the four schools will identify a maximum of fifteen students per school.  A four week summer encampment at the Delaware Valley College will provide students with the opportunity to engage in group and individual educational programming.  The program will run during the month of July (students return home on weekends).  Parental participation is an essential component of program activities.  The thematic educational focus will be on environmental issues.  Through the emphasis on the environment, students will learn basic scientific, mathematical and communication skills.  In addition, an on going sub theme will be career development/ exposure.  This component will be carried out in follow up activities as well.  Follow up activities will include mentoring visits to the four schools and evaluative activities.",
