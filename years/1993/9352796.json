 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352796  Makedon  Parallelism is the future of computing and computer science and  should therefore be at the heart of the CS curriculum. Instead  of continuing along the evolutionary path by introducing  parallel computation \"top down\" (first in special junior-senior  level courses), this radical approach will introduce  parallelism at the earliest possible stages of instruction.  Specifically, a completely new freshman-level course on data  structures that integrates parallel computation naturally, and  retains the emphasis on laboratory instruction will be  developed. This will help to steer the curriculum as  expeditiously as possible toward parallel computing, and  provide a national model for other schools to do the same. It  will also serve to meet as directly as possible the national  need identified in the HPCC initiative to transfer knowledge of  high performance computing as quickly as possible into  education. This approach is novel in three distinct and  essential ways. First, parallel computing will be taught to  freshmen in a course designed from beginning to end to do so.  Second, the course will be motivating with examples from  scientific computation. Third, multimedia and visualization  will be used as instructional aids to produce a seamless,  exploratory environment. The three primary objectives are: 1)  to begin a reform of the undergraduate curriculum with an  innovative, laboratory-based, freshman course on parallel  computation, 2) to provide a model for national use, and 3) to  produce tools and methodologies that improve student  understanding of the basic principles of parallel computing  that can be disseminated to other schools.  ***",
