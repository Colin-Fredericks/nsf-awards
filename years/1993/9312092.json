 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312092  Kirby  This proposal presents a new  analytic tool for extracting a  reduced description of general  dynamical systems.  It details how  systems with dynamics which lie on  low-dimensional invariant manifolds  or attractors can be reformulated  into systems of low dimensionality.   In the study of such systems one is  typically confronted with complex  models wither in the form of  partial differential equations, or  large systems of ordinary  differential or difference  equations.  This \"high-  dimensionality\" contradicts the  conjectured idea that the model of  the system should be governable by  a small number of equations.  This  project addresses the issue of how  to objectively proceed from an  overly detailed and redundant  description based on modeling  considerations to a reduced model  which accurately reflects the true  dimensionality of the system.  A  technique is presented which allows  the reformulation of the model to  its optimally reduced form and it  is shown how this can be used to  facilitate the study of dynamical  systems with chaotic or turbulent  solutions.  The basis of the  approach is the reduction of the  model, wither a partial  differential equation or system of  ordinary differential equations, to  the simplest possible form.  This  is carried out using a neural  network architecture which  resembles and bottleneck.  The  neural network constructs a  nonlinear vector function  approximation in several variables.   The values of the nodes in the  bottleneck correspond to the  dynamical information optimally  compressed onto a manifold of  lowest possible dimension.   Consequently, the model equations  can be formulated in terms of the  variables on the bottleneck  manifold.  This can be viewed as a  nonlinear compression of the phase  space of the bottleneck manifold.   This can be viewed as a nonlinear  compression of the phase space of  the dynamical system and is  mathematically equivalent to a  projection of the flow onto a non-  orthogonal basis.  ***",
