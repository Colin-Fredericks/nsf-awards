The equipment (hardware/software combination) proposed                 here would enable the college faculty to develop tutorials on                   disk accompanied by manuals for CADD/CAM instruction; to                        enhance efforts to train trainers...that is, to provide                         training for instructors at the secondary and collegiate level                  who in turn teach computer assisted drafting in a program of                    applied math and science;                                                       to improve access to the handicapped and other special                          populations who have the ability to compete successfully in                     drafting occupations but need special equipment in order to                     keep pace with other students.  To enable the Drafting and                      Design department to be designated as a national beta test site                 for CADD/CAM hardware and software manufacturers, which would                   not only enhance learning opportunities for students, but also                  their employability.                                                            to provide enrolled undergraduate students more efficient                       educational opportunities that reflect the technological                        advances in industrial engineering technologies.",
