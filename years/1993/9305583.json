 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is very little doubt that one of the most meaningful events               in the life span of an individual is the acquisition of puberty.                Over the years, extensive efforts have been devoted to unravel                  the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying this stage of                          development.  Because the neuroendocrine mechanisms involved in                 the control of puberty are exceedingly complex, progress, to                    date, has been slow.  It is clear, however, that the                            hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is the anatomical and                       functional core of the process.  Moreover, puberty does not                     result from an isolated event, but is rather the consequence of a               cascade of interdependent processes initiated very early in                     development.  Within this framework, the initiating events are                  thought to occur in the brain, where they result in the                         synchronous activation of neurons that secrete luteinizing                      hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH).  Although the onset and                       progression of puberty depends upon the increased production and                secretion of LHRH, little is known about the molecular and                      cellular events that activate this event.  Dr. Ojeda is one of                  the few scientists attempting to tackle this intricate and                      perplexing problem.  With this Small Grant for Exploratory                      Research (SGER), he will define the gene hierarchy controlling                  within the brain the events underlying the initiation of puberty.               Dr. Ojeda will examine whether the POU-domain family of homeobox                genes are \"upstream\" components of the hierarchy of genes                       controlling neuronal functions relevant to the pubertal                         activation of the LHRH neuronal network.  The genes are likely                  candidates because they are abundantly expressed in the embryonic               hypothalamus, the brain region where LHRH neurons are primarily                 localized.  Moreover, the expression of some of the genes persist               in this LHRH region during post-natal development and even in                   adulthood.  Dr. Ojeda will use an experimental model in which                   hypothalamic lesions are used to accelerate puberty in immature                 females.  The results will not only impact greatly on our                       understanding of mammalian puberty but would open new avenues for               exploring the fundamental role that regulatory genes play in the                nervous system.",
