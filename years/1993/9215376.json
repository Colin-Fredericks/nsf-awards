 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is an empirical study of trade and                         telecommunications traffic between China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and                Macao.  It addresses theoretical issues raised by recent work on                trade in producer services and the role of knowledge spillover in               economic growth.                                                                                                                                                The study is designed to find out whether the volume and balance                of international telecommunications traffic can be explained by                 assuming that trade in producer services constitutes a                          significant portion of that traffic.  If this assumption is                     valid, then the balance of incoming nd outgoing traffic should be               related in a definite way to the commodities trade balance and to               factor endowments.                                                                                                                                              This project involves collaboration between researchers in China,               the US, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.  Results of this study should                    contribute to trade theory, theories of economic growth, and                    understanding of the optimal framework for regulation of                        international telecommunications services.",
