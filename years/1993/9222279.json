This project will                implement density-estimation algorithms to draw differential-                   frequency boundaries for language data, using the extensive                     computer files of the Linguistic Atlas of the Middle and South                  Atlantic States (LAMSAS); these boundaries will then be compared to             dialect feature boundaries generated with pre-statistical                       qualitative methods and to boundaries of selected topographical and             cultural areas. Prior NSF support assisted the development of                   efficient small-computer methods to encode LAMSAS data and to                   develop preliminary methods for its statistical analysis. This                  project will process files from the existing data-bases with                    statistical algorithms and with GIS (Geographical Information                   System) software for displays; a Sun work station will provide fast             processing for computer-intensive statistics and graphics. Specific             programs will be written by a consultant to implement density-                  estimation for LAMSAS data and to enable comparison with digitized              maps of older boundaries under GIS. Approximately 50 items will                 receive comprehensive analysis and comparison, leading to several               articles on the nature of areal variation  when it is conceived as              the differential frequency of linguistic features, and on the                   relation of this quantitative method to earlier qualitative                     methods.",
