 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program aims at developing the geometric                     foundations that underlie practically relevant properties of                    highly nonlinear control systems (that is, systems whose dynamics               are inadequately, or not at all, described by linear                            approximations). Highly oscillatory control variations will be                  examined with the goal of obtaining better criteria for                         controllability and optimality than presently exist, and to                     obtain new algorithms for stabilizing feedback laws. Methods from               algebraic combinatorics will be used to characterize the                        computational complexity of deciding controllability,                           stabilizability and other relevant control objectives and to                    develop new path planning algorithms.                                                This project will develop the geometric foundations that                   underlie the dynamics of high-performance automatic control                     systems. It focuses primarily on systems that have very highly                  nonlinear dynamics and that have many interconnected components                 influencing each other. The engineering demands for ever higher                 performance, or even optimality, often require completely new                   control designs since classical linearization techniques for                    control design is often inadequate in such situations. By                       bringing together techniques from various areas of pure                         mathematics, such as differential geometry and algebraic                        combinatorics, new algorithms for finding optimal solutions to                  path planning problems (e.g., for robot arms or largely                         autonomously operating intelligent vehicles) will be developed.",
