 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305202     Atkins  The long-term goal of the proposed research is to develop  strategies and methods for the production of patterned arrays of  proteins in one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices.  Specific   aims include: (1) To determine the molecular mechanisms of metal  ion-induced assembly of \"protein tubes\" from bacterial gluatmine  synthetase (GS) dodecamers.  (2) To manipulate the exterior  \"stacking\" surface of GS and construct mutant proteins that  preferentially \"stack\" with other mutants rather than with  identical dodecamers.  (3) To alter the metal ion specificity of  the \"stacking\" reaction.  (4) To determine which subunit interfaces  are disrupted and reformed during the pressure-induced dissociation  and reassociation of GS and pyruvate dehydrogenase.  %%%  Development of patterned structures on a nanometer size-scale is  widely believed to hold promise for new developments in materials  research and manufacturing (nanofabrication).  One approach to  creating such structures involves utilization and modification of  naturally occurring processes, such as protein self-association.   By introducing modifications into the surface charge and structure  of several target proteins, the investigator intends to determine  the \"rules of the game\" which specify the types of two and three  dimensional aggregates which form.  ***",
