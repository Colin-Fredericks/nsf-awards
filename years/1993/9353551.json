 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project will involve eight Tennessee universities,                the Center of Excellence for Science and Mathematics Education,                 public schools, and state agencies in the development of a                      comprehensive systematic state-wide program of improvement in                   elementary science and associated mathematics for schools                       throughout the state.  The project developed will prepare teachers              to implement exemplary science education experiences which are                  congruent with the emerging NSTA standards and which employ                     contemporary educational technology.                                                                                                                            The nature of the cooperative activities among the eight                        universities and the participating schools and agencies will ensure             that the best talent in the state will be available to plan,                    provide, and evaluate professional development activities for                   teachers.  A variety of innovative delivery techniques including                compressed video and satellite will integral features of this                   project.                                                                                                                                                        Planning activities, leading to the submission of a teacher                     enhancement proposal, will be conducted over a one year period.                 These planning activities will involve all shareholders in                      elementary science education in Tennessee.  This project partially              fulfills one of the major goals of the Tennessee Systemic                       Initiative.//",
