 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303448  Sardar    Research on this grant aims to investigate the optical properties  of rare earth ions doped in crystalline host materials using the  techniques of laser spectroscopy.  Two important neodymium-based  single crystals: YVO4:Nd3+ (1 %) and CaMgZnY2Ge3012:Nd3+ (2%)  will be studied initially.  There have been some studies on the  first material, but none on the second.  In the final phase of  the project,  a more complex, triply-doped material: YAG: Cr3+  (1%), Tm3+ (5%), Ho3+ (1%) will be investigated.  A complete and  systematic spectroscopic investigation of these materials will be  performed, their optical and laser properties will be compared  with those of existing laser materials, and  the potential of  these materials as lasers will be evaluated.  The measurements  will include absorption, emission, and excitation spectra and  fluorescence lifetimes at different temperatures.  %%%  These materials have received much attention in recent years  since their emission wavelength falls in the 2um range, which has  proven to be very attractive for a number of medical applications  because of the strong water absorption at this wavelength. The  2.1um 5I7 - 5I8 laser transition in Ho3+ is attractive because of  its long upper laser level lifetime, of the order of 5 ms,  permitting larger energy storage than Nd:YAG, and its eye-safe  wavelength.  Study of the important mechanism of energy transfer  from Cr3+ to Tm3+ and finally to Ho3+ in this crystal will  provide an excellent educational experience for undergraduates  involved in the project; this grant is part of NSF's Research in  Undergraduate Institutions(RUI) activity.  The proposed work is  in an area of current scientific interest in the field of  photonics, is technologically relevant, and has excellent  potential to provide a rewarding educational opportunity for the  participating undergraduates who will be exposed to modern  spectroscopic equipment, techniques, and theories.  ***",
