High-  level algebraic or logical query languages have been shown to be  extremely useful in modern database systems, and there is a need to  extend their scope.  These sorts of languages allow database  programs to be written clearly, quickly, and accurately.  However,  they make it harder for the database system to find an efficient  method to answer queries or to implement constraints.  Logically  expressed constraints are an important feature of distributed  database systems, especially when used for collaboration or  integration of separate databases.  Methods for checking  constraints as the connected databases change is especially  important; goals are to check for constraint violations as locally  and efficiently as possible.  Logical languages frequently involve  negation in rules, or nonmonotonic reasoning, where providing more  information at one level allows one to infer less at another level.   Efficient and general ways to find intuitively correct  interpretations of logic with negation are being sought.  Finally,  the use of algebra or logic as a query language requires the  optimization of expressions involving the join of many relations.   Efficient ways to find good orders of joining are being studied.   If successful, large-scale database systems will become easier to  use and will be capable of performing operations such as  distributed constraint maintenance that they are not able to do  with adequate efficiency today.  ***",
