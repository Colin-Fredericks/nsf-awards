 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year for two years, a faculty enhancement program is being                 offered to 25 faculty members from a groups of universities and                 two-year colleges in Puerto Rico.  As a short term goal, the                    program aims to introduce mathematics faculty members to the                    use of technology in the undergraduate mathematics classroom as                 a way of enhancing their teaching as well as the learning                       experiences of their students.  Because the program is                          targeting academic institutions and students of modest economic                 means, there is a focus on technology which is relatively                       inexpensive.  This will allow participating colleges and                        universities to implement what they learn on a large scale. The                 workshop will focus on topics in precalculus and calculus.                      Follow-up activities are establishing a base for continued                      collaboration among participating institutions on issues                        concerning the use of technology and other curriculum matters                   in undergraduate mathematics education.  The program consists                   of three main activities:  software workshops, graphic                          calculator workshops, and a conference cycle.***//",
