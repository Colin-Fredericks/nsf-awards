 "awd_abstract_narration": "ONE, TWO, THREE...INFINITY:  The World of Mathematics is                   a series of eight one-hour films about math in the real world.                  It will be produced by WQED/Pittsburgh for prime-time                           broadcast on the 340 PBS stations and in many foreign                           countries.  The goal of the series is not to \"teach\" math but                   to show, in an entertaining fashion, the importance of math in                  many walks of life--music, art, engineering and                                 communications, to name a few.  Math affects our lives                          everyday in ways many of us have never imagined.  Yet few of                    us ever stop to think about it, perhaps because of \"Math                        anxiety.\" This series will be the first to reveal math's                        importance not only as a tool for discovery, but also as a                      major cultural force.  Drawing on WQED's proven skill in                        creating special visual effects, and making liberal use of                      magic and mystery, puzzles, and paradoxes, the series will                      break down the public's fears and misconceptions about math.                    We hope viewers--children as well as adults--will come away                     with a new appreciation of mathematics and, most important, a                   more open attitude toward learning about it--the first step                     toward a higher level of math literacy.  WQED's Producers and                   cinematographers bring many years of experience on such award-                  -winning programs as PLANET EARTH, THE INFINITE VOYAGE and the                  NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS. A diverse and distinguished                       advisory committee will help shape the series and ensure its                    accuracy.  And a companion book, together with a program of                     educational materials and activities, will extend its reach                     beyond the television audience, making the series a potent                      catalyst for learning.",
