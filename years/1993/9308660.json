 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308660  Keeney  Regulations intended to reduce health and safety risks and  thereby reduce fatalities cost billions of dollars.  A crucial  question is whether the costs of some of these regulations induce  more fatalities than the regulations themselves avoid.  Several  aspects of this critical issue are addressed by the methodology  developed in this research.  Existing evidence indicates that  lower incomes are associated with higher mortality risks.   Previous work quantified the relationship between lower incomes  and higher mortality risks.  A model was developed for estimating  the number of fatalities induced by economic expenditures.  This  model indicated that, depending on the distribution of costs of  regulations throughout society, one fatality may be induced for  each $3 to $7.5 million cost of regulation.  This research will  extend the existing model.  Analyses will be performed to examine  the implications of using average census tract income data in  analyses using the model and to indicate whether the relationship  between lower incomes and increased fatalities has been changing  over the last forty years.  Because of the important role that  such results might play in policy decisions affecting the  allocation of billions of dollars to address public risks, the  proposed research will also address questions of how to  appropriately interpret and use the results of the research.  ***",
