Two graphics                    workstations with ancillary data storage and output equipment                   and commercially available molecular graphics/scientific                        software will be networked together to create a computational                   chemistry facility for studies in macromolecular science.  The                  projects to be undertaken include:                                                                                                                              1)  Examination of the intermolecular forces responsible for                    chiral recognition of optical isomers binding to polymers such                  as cellulose, polymethacrylates and DNA.                                        2)  Computer-assisted molecular design and testing of                           bis-intercalating agents for sequence-specific binding sites on                 DNA.                                                                            3)  An assessment of the unique micro environments made by                      polysiloxanes with pendant 4-aminopyridyl groups that fold into                 highly efficient catalysts.                                                     4)  An investigation of the number, size, spatial distribution                  and electrostatic features of charge patches on proteins and                    why and how proteins interact with polyelectrolytes to form                     complex coacervates.                                                            5)  Designed catalysts as mimics of biological hydrolases and                   acyl-transferases.                                                                                                                                              %%%                                                                             The computer hardware and software in the macromolecular                        modeling system allows one to simulate interactions that take                   place in molecules in a real laboratory environment.  The                       insights and information one obtains from such calculations                     make it possible to design more efficient and more effective                    laboratory experiments.",
