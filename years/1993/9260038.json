 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the synthesis and characterization               of ferrocene based surfactants.  Ferrocene is a chemical group                  which consists of an iron atom in the +2 oxidation state sharing                electrons with two five membered rings so that the rings become                 aromatic.  The ferrocene can be oxidized to a unit positive charge              by the loss of an electron from the iron so that the Fe is in the               +3 oxidation state; addition of the electron regenerates the                    ferrocene as Fe is reduced back to the +2 state.  The uncharged and             +1 charged ferrocene therefore form a reversible (switchable) redox             pair.  The study will attempt to attach hydrocarbon moieties to one             ring of the ferrocene group.  The attachment of the hydrocarbon                 group gives the resulting molecule a switchable surfactant                      character; in the oxidized, uncharged form it is essentially a                  nonpolar molecule while in the oxidized form it is a cationic                   surfactant with a charged headgroup and a hydrocarbon tail.  This               project will explore various synthesis routes for making different              kinds of switchable surfactants, and will characterize the ability              of the surface active form to lower interfacial tension, and to                 form micelles.  The micelle forming ability of the surfactant is                a key feature.  When the surfactant is in the surface active form               and has formed micelles, reduction will deactivate the amphiphillic             character thereby causing the micelles to breakup.  This ability                to break micelles on demand is important in many surfactant based               separations where micelles solubilize targeted products.  In each               of these separations, a final step is to remove the solute from the             micelle; by using switchable surfactants, reduction can affect                  breakup of the micelle and release of the solute.",
