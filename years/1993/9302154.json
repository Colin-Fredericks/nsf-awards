Much of this radioactivity has                 collected in the surface layers of the ocean, where levels have                 been raised by at least a factor of 200 above the pre-nuclear                   activity levels.                                                                                                                                                Iodine is incorporated into organic matter as it forms, so this                 increased 129I activity will accompany freshly formed organics and              distinguish them from pre-nuclear. Except during primary                        production, the great majority of iodine in the biota is derived                through the food chain, and not by direct uptake from seawater.                 Therefore past values of the ongoing build-up should be recorded in             archived biological specimens.  If, in a particular region, we can              document the history of 129I concentration in the surface ocean                 waters, and in surface ocean biota that are the source of carbon                (and iodine) for almost the entire food web below, then we may be               able to identify the year-class of iodine present in all post-bomb              marine  organic matter in that region, and thereby iodine date the              organic matter. This approach could then be extended to any other               region where suitable archives exist.                                                                                                                           This work will establish past and present 129I values within the                waters of the Gulf of Mexico.  These levels are below detection by              all commonly employed measurement techniques but are approximately              100,000 times the sensitivity limits when Accelerator Mass                      Spectrometry (AMS) is employed. The AMS group of the University of              Rochester will make these measurements.",
