 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thousands of small earthquakes rupture the earth's crust every                  hour, but few of these events ever evolve into the large                        earthquakes which threaten the human social structure.  The                     question of what stops most small earthquakes from cascading into               larger, more dangerous earthquakes remains a scientific enigma                  whose solution could provide a key to earthquake hazard mitigation              in many populated regions of the world.  Two possibilities have                 been presented for determining what stop earthquakes.  The first is             that earthquakes are stopped by barriers of stronger material.  The             second is that earthquakes stop simply because they run out of                  energy and cannot continue propagating.  This project will use 3-D              finite difference computer modeling of spontaneous rupture                      propagation to assess the contrasting models of earthquake rupture              arrest.                                                                                                                                                         Interactive activities at the host institution include:  leading                seminars on static and dynamic fault interaction and presenting at              least one guest lecture per quarter.  Dr. Harris's visibility as an             active researcher in the field of earthquake seismology will both               encourage more women students to apply their expertise to                       scientific endeavors and encourage the existing majority of male                scientists to promote more women into the upper echelons of                     research and teaching.                                                                                                                                          This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
