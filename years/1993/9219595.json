 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219595  Zeitler         The 40Ar/39Ar dating of feldspar has enormous potential for  helping geologists determine quantitative temperature-time paths  over the range of 150oC to 350oC.  Such  time-temperature  information over such a range of low temperatures is of great  importance to scientists evaluating such issues as the architecture  and evolution of the crust or the origin and evolution of  sedimentary basins and their attendant water and hydrocarbon  resources.  However, to this point the technique has only been  tested in short-term laboratory heating experiments and in  presumably well-characterized geological contexts.  Now that  sophisticated interpretative models have been developed for use in  quantitative thermochronometry, it is important that the 40Ar/39Ar  dating of feldspar be evaluated in a slow-cooling geological  environment.  The KTB deep drill hole in Germany offers an ideal  natural laboratory with which to examine the closure of feldspar  to diffusive Ar loss during slow cooling, as this hole already has  reached temperatures which overlap the closure interval for  feldspars and is projected to reach ~300oC.  In this project, a  suite of samples from deep in the KTB hole will be examined which  will permit the principal investigator to view the process of Ar  closure as it is happening, and would be an invaluable benchmark  for virtually all applied studies which use feldspar  thermochronometry.         At the same time, the understanding of 40Ar/39Ar systematics  in feldspar is sufficiently good that study of shallow samples from  the KTB hole will permit the principal investigator to monitor in  detail the post-orogenic cooling of the local crust; he will assess  the relative roles that thermal relaxation and denudation have  played, and will look for evidence of even a very mild Tertiary  thermal event that might be responsible for the high gradients seen  in the KTB hole.  Such information will be highly useful for models  of thermal evolution of the lithosphere du ring and after mountain  building.   ***",
