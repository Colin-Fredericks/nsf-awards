 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focussed on two projects.  The first part involves             continued studies on magnetites and zinc-ferrites.  The main thrust             of this research is directed to the investigation of nickel                     sulphide-selenide systems.  This material exhibits properties of a              good insulator, a good metal, or a metal-insulator for x values of              0, 2, and 0.5, respectively.  This property presumably is driven by             electron correlation effects.  The systems can be studied by                    varying the sulphide/selenide ratio while leaving the cation                    sublattice intact.  The following studies are planned:  growth of               single crystals, followed by adjustments of stoichiometry,                      electrical measurements, magnetization investigations, specific                 heat studies, structural research, and optical measurements.  The               data acquisition is not just of intrinsic interest but is to be                 used to identify the changeover from the insulating state, through              a narrow band correlated state, to the metal-insulated transition               regime, and into the region of good metallic behavior, during which             the lattice remains basically unaltered.  The data thus serve as a              test for current theories of electron transport in the various                  regimes.",
