 "awd_abstract_narration": "To be adaptive, an animal's behavior must change depending                 on the organism's physiological or developmental state.  Dr.                    Truman's research is directed towards understanding both external               (e.g. circadian rhythms) factors and internal (e.g. steroid and                 peptide hormones) factors that influence the central nervous                    system to regulate behavior.  Using a relatively simple                         invertebrate model system, he is unraveling the mechanisms by                   which ecdysteroids, a class of steroid hormones, affect the                     release of eclosion hormone, a neuropeptide, to orchestrate                     changes in behavior.  Dr. Truman has identified four neurons that               are responsible for all of the eclosion hormone found in the                    central nervous system.  He will now focus on the cellular                      properties of these neurons.  Using state of the art                            electrophysiological and anatomical techniques, Dr Truman will                  define the mechanisms that control the release of this peptide,                 and then determine how it acts on the central nervous system to                 evoke the stereotyped behavior changes.  In addition, he will                   employ a different invertebrate model system to examine the                     importance of circadian control in controlling behavior.  The                   results from this research will provide novel insights into the                 relationship between the neuroendocrine system and behavior.                    These data serve as the foundation for the development and                      application of practical procedures in controlling agricultural                 and medical insect pests.",
