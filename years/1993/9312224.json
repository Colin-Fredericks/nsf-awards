 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312224  Braun    In prior work, we have studied concurrent visual task situations in  which the observer directs visual attention at one part of a visual  scene, thus leaving other parts unattended, but attempts to judge  attributes of both the attended and unattended parts of the scene.   These experiments have demonstrated that a significant amount of  information, especially about salient objects, can be discriminated  in unattended regions of the field of view.  Here, we formulate a  hypothesis which could explain these observations, and propose to  test it psychophysically.  This hypothesis is based on our earlier  proposal that a \"saliency map\" guides visual attention.  Our new  hypothesis it states that the saliency map provides a rudimentary  but functional alternative to visual attention, and that it can  sometimes mediate nonattentive stimulus selection, nonattentive  figure-ground segregation, and nonattentive access to awareness.   To test this hypothesis, we propose to conduct experiments on  unattended but salient objects, investigating feature  discrimination, as well as feature conjunctions and other \"binding\"  phenomena.    Ongoing research in our laboratory, supported by the NSF grant \"An  integrated, neurally based model of selective, visual attention,\"  (BIR 92-14238), aims to build a model of visual attention and the  saliency map at the systems level, on the basis of neurally  plausible elements.  The psychophysical experiments proposed here  will help to guide this effort and will help decide what perceptual  phenomena (grouping, feature conjoining, apparent motion, tracking)  should be our benchmarks in evaluating the model.***",
