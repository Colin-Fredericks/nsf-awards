In solving these problems  numerically, it is very convenient to use a uniform Cartesian  grid in spite of the fact that the interface may cut between grid  points.  The investigator and his colleagues develop finite  difference methods that aim to give highly accurate solutions at  all grid points while maintaining the efficiency and ease of  implementation of uniform grid methods.  Several specific  problems are studied in depth.  One goal is to develop improved  versions of Peskin's \"immersed boundary method\" for  incompressible fluid dynamics in regions with complicated moving  boundaries, such as blood flow in a beating heart.  Hyperbolic  wave equations with discontinuous coefficients arise in modeling  the structure of the earth in seismic oil exploration.  Other  applications include porous media equations arising in oil  reservoir simulation and groundwater transport, and multi-phase  solidification problems.  In modeling fluid motion near rigid  boundaries, an additional problem arises in solving an  ill-conditioned system of equations for the strength of  discontinuities at the boundary.  Iterative methods for solving  such problems are studied.       Simulating the behavior of complicated structures in the  real world typically involves solving large systems of equations  that cannot be solved exactly.  Instead the solution must  be approximated by numerical methods on high performance  computers. The investigators study problems in which there is a  boundary or interface that has a complicated shape and may be  moving in time. Examples include the surface of a body of water  or a bubble surrounded by fluid, the surface of a beating heart,  or the boundary between oil and some fluid that is injected into  the earth to force oil out of an oil field.  In these examples  the equations being solved model the flow o f some fluid.   Another problem is to study the motion of the boundary between  melting ice and the surrounding water, or between different  phases of a substance more generally.  In this case the equations  model the conduction of heat.  In oil exploration it is necessary  to model the motion of seismic waves in the earth and the manner  in which they reflect off interfaces between different kinds of  rock deep within the earth.  The goal of the project is to  develop relatively simple methods that can be used to solve a  wide variety of such problems with complicated boundaries or  interfaces.  ***",
