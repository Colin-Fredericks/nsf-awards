It is expected that in the near future, millions of                   people in the U.S. alone will carry a lightweight, inexpensive                  terminal (such as the personal communicator recently announced by               AT&T and EO or Apple's Newton) with wireless connection to the                  worldwide information network. Mobile computing poses new                       challenges to the data management community. How will the mobility              of users affect data placement, query and transaction processing?               What is the role of wireless medium in distribution of information?             How can one query data broadcast over the wireless? What is the                 influence of limited battery life on data access from a mobile                  palmtop terminal? How should prolonged periods of disconnection of              the mobile machines be handled? The primary objective of this                   exploratory research is to provide preliminary solutions to the                 above problems and identify which of them are technically the most              challenging and for which of them solutions can be provided by                  minor extensions of current technology. In particular, the                      following problems are being investigated: (1) locating users;  (2)             querying location dependent data;  (3) handling frequent                        disconnection; and (4) replicating information and services to                  provide information from anywhere and at anytime. Further, a                    possible prototype of a system for wireless broadcasting of                     information to a large number of users is also being developed.",
