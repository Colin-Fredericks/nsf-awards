 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303550  Goresky       The Lefschetz trace formula of Arthur is an expression for  the alternating sum of traces of the map induced on the L2  cohomology of a locally symmetric space Y by a Hecke  Correspondence.  This expression is given in terms of orbital  integrals, volumes of stabilizer groups, and characters of  discrete series representations.  Arthur's formula will be  rederived (in this joint project with R. MacPherson of M.I.T.) by  interpreting it as the Lefschetz fixed point formula for the  action of the Hecke correspondence on the weighted cohomology of  the reductive Borel-Serre compactification of Y.  This  interpretation will be used (a) to extend Arthur's formula to  include the case of the ordinary cohomology, (b) to derive a  similar expression for the alternating sum of traces on the Hodge  components of the cohomology, and (c) to conjecture a related  expression which should be valid for Shimura varieties defined  over fields of characteristic p > 0.       During the 1970's, R. Langlands (of the Institute for  Advanced Study in Princeton) outlined a series of conjectures and  ideas of enormous scope and depth which, when fully explored and  verified, will result in a \"grand unification\" of several  branches of mathematics, including number theory, representation  theory of Lie groups, and harmonic analysis.  During the last  twenty years enormous progress has been made on this program and  very difficult obstacles have been overcome.  Nevertheless, it is  commonly believed that it may take another fifty years (or more)  before Langlands' ideas are fully explored.  The present project  concerns a newly discovered geometric and topological  interpretation and proof of the \"trace formula,\" one of the basic  tools in the subject.  Using this interpretation, the trace  formula has been generalized and refined to the point where it  may be applied to the central objects of interest (namely, Hecke  correspondences on Shimura varieties).  Although these geometric  techniques have b een developed primarily to carry out this step  in Langlands' program, they have already been applied to problems  in other areas of mathematics.  ***",
