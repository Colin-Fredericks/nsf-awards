 "awd_abstract_narration": "9254431  Soileau    The East Baton Rouge School Parish has planned a five-year  district-wide teacher enhancement effort for physical science in  grades K-3.  This project builds on a state-funded pilot project in  five elementary schools.  Two teachers in each of the district's 63  elementary schools will receive training in the use of hands on  kits, background science content, inquiry teaching methods,  performance assessment of students, and integration of science with  other subjects.  Design of the workshops and instruction of the  teachers will be the responsibility of Gayle Kirwan (American  Institute of Pysics).  Teachers will attend several three-week  graduate workshops at LSU, during which they will learn content and  instructional methods tied to hands-on kits.  These teachers will  provide inservice training to the other teachers in their schools.   Principals will receive two days of training when their school  enters the program.  Student enrollment in the Parish is nearly 60%  African-American, Hispanic, or other underrepresented groups.  The  Parish has been undergoing the transition to site-based decision  making, and standardized testing is being replaced by portfolio or  other performance-based assessment tools in many schools.  The  Parish has sent a team to the NSTA/Monsanto Institute and to the  NSRC Leadership Institute.  Partnerships have been formed with  Panasonic, Monsanto, and Dow Chemical.    This reform effort has the potential to create exemplary science  instruction for tens of thousands of minority school children, and  to provide a model for systemic reform in rural districts.    Cost sharing on this project represents 79% of the NSF  contribution.",
