 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in two areas.  First the                      principal investigator will study permutation representations.                  He will classify all monodromy groups of primitive branched                     coverings of Riemann surfaces which are sufficiently large in                   terms of the genus.  He will also consider similar problems over                finite fields and their algebraic closures, and over number                     fields.  In addition, he will consider problems involving                       nonconjugate subgroups which induce the same permutation                        representation.  The second major area of investigation is matrix               theory.  In particular, the principal investigator will determine               what can be said about the minimal polynomial of a symmetric                    matrix over the integers.  He also intends to investigate the                   structure of the variety of commuting r-tuples of matrices.                          A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.                 It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and                chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are                finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of               the past decade is the classification of the finite simple                      groups,  the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000                      journal pages.  This research is aimed at using this                            classification in the study of arbitrary finite groups and other                algebraic structures.",
