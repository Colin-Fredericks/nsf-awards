 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides continuing support for a Research                           Experiences for Undergraduates Site in the Department of                        Bacteriology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The                       program will provide an intensive summer research experience                    for ten undergraduate                                                           students in microbiology, molecular biology and related                         fields.  Extra effort will be made to recruit qualified                         students who are women, minority or disabled, and/or who                        otherwise have limited research opportunities at their own                      institution.  The main goal of the program is to attract and                    stimulate motivated students  to pursue careers in research,                    while providing them with hands-on experience.  The                             Department of Bacteriology has an internationally recognized                    research faculty, committed to both undergraduate and                           graduate education, who will direct individual laboratory                       research projects.  Participating students will work as part                    of a dynamic research team  investigating basic problems in                     cellular or molecular biology.  Students will become                            familiar with the research techniques of microbiology,                          biochemistry, genetics and molecular biology  using modern                      equipment and facilities in the Department of Bacteriology.                     Students will attend professional seminars and make written                     and oral presentations of their own research findings  The                      Department has an established record of providing research                      opportunities for its own undergraduate students and has                        successfully managed a summer research program for sixty-one                    students since 1988.",
