The conference is  designed to address the current status and future possibilities  of nano- and microfabrication technologies and biology.  Scientists from such disparate disciplines as material science  and engineering, and various subdisciplines of biological  sciences will participate.    The objective of the conference is to explore contemporary and  emerging approaches of nano- and microfabrication as they apply  to biology.  The intent of the conference is to bring together  engineers/physical scientists and biologists including  biophysicists, cell biologists, neuroscientists, and plant  biologists.  The conference will address the materials science  and engineering aspects of nano- and microfabrication, how  biologists have implemented such fabricated devices in their  research endeavors, and where the opportunities are for fruitful  collaboration between biologists and engineers.  An important  aspect of this objective will be to inform young scientists.  The  proceedings of the conference will be published by the  Engineering Foundation.    European and Japanese scientists will participate in this  conference, making it an international meeting.  ***",
