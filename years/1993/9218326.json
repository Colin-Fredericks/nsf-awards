 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor James McGuire of Tulane University and Professor              Michio Matsuzawa, The University of Electro-Communications, Tokyo.              Also involved in the project are Professor C.D. Lin of Kansas State             University and Dr. Mineo Kimura of Argonne National Laboratory in               the United States and several scientists from the University of                 Tsukuba and Kyoto University in Japan.  The goal is to continue                 research underway in atomic and molecular collisions.  The results              of the studies will be tested at several experimental facilities in             the United States, Japan, and Europe.                                                                                                                           The groups at Tulane and the University of Tsukuba will continue                calculations of double ionization of helium by photons to further               understanding of the dynamics of few electron atomic processes.                 The groups at Kansas State and the University of Electro-                       Communications as well as the University of Tsukuba and Kyoto                   University will work on the structures and the dynamics of few                  electron atoms.  The groups at Argonne and the University of                    Electro-Communications will study the formation of doubly excited               states.  The results are expected to resolve some conflict and                  clarify understanding of the nature of few-electron effects in                  atomic and molecular dynamics and produce new computer codes useful             for evaluating properties of few and many electron systems.",
