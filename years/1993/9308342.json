 "awd_abstract_narration": "Statistical analysis is an essential component of scientific  and technical research and development. These analyses have broad  mathematical links in common, although many problems also require  specific techniques adapted to the particular application. This  research proposal involves investigations into aspects of this  common mathematical structure. One focus of the research is  nonparametric function estimation, which encompasses varied  applications in image processing and in electronic signal  processing and analysis.  The current research will establish  desirable general properties for such procedures. It will then  examine to what extent the procedures in common use have these  properties and, where they do not, how they should be modified.  Another goal of the research is a general theory which explains  how to construct the smallest possible confidence sets of given  confidence. The implications for specific cases will also be  investigated. A third focus is on general methods for evaluating  probabilistic forecasts, such as the predicted chance of rain.  Considerable theory has been developed for the case of a single  forecaster predicting a binomial (=\"yes\" or \"no\") event.  Extensions will be proposed for the case of multinomial events  and for forecasts produced by group consensus rather than by one  individual.",
