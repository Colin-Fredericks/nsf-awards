 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed correlator chip is intended for the two main                       application areas in radio astronomy:  cross-correlation                        spectroscopy in aperture synthesis arrays and autocorrelation                   spectroscopy at cm and mm wavelengths.                                                                                                                          The objectives of Phase I are to design, simulate, and layout a                 CMOS digital correlator chip with the following characteristics:                a) 1 GHz sample rate, b) 10 channels, c) 2-bit (four-level)                     quantization, and d) 32-bit counter/accumulator.  It has already                been demonstrated experimentally that the 1 GHz sampling rate can               be achieved with a combination of systolic architecture, novel                  pipeline differential logic circuits, and a 1.0 um CMOS fabrication             process.  The objectives of Phase II are to increase the number of              channels per chip to 100 while maintaining the 1 GHz clock                      frequency and the 4-level quantization scheme.  Provision will also             be made for a number of features such as 1-bit correlation for                  solar burst observation, blanking of correlation coefficients for               pulsar observations, and phase switch mode.                                                                                                                     The commercial market for correlator chips is estimated at two to               five million dollars in 1992 and it will grow 15% to 20% annually.              Presently, most digital correlator chips are designed by each radio             astronomy laboratory for their own internal use.  The performance-              to-cost ratio of the proposed correlator chip will be up to 10                  times higher than that of existing correlators.",
