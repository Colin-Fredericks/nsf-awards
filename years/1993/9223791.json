 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                  Chemistry Program, addresses the development of an                              understanding of the processes which occur when molecular ions                  of tens of eV energy impact upon surfaces.  Surface induced                     dissociation (SID) and ion/surface reactions occur upon                         collision.  The overall goal of this work is to develop the                     understanding which is needed to use ion/surface collisions as                  a structural analysis tool in analytical mass spectrometry.                     Self-assembled monolayer surfaces, as well as molecular                         adsorbates on  characterizable gold and silver substrates will                  be investigated as useful surfaces for these SID applications.                  The range of ion/surface collision phenomena  to be explored                    will include low energy sputtering of ionized adsorbates,                       partial neutralization of doubly charged ions, and molecular                    beam collisions with surfaces.                                                  %%%                                                                             The structural characterization of large molecules by mass                      spectrometry is facilitated by the use of ion collision methods                 which introduce significant internal energy into the analyte.                   A very promising approach for introducing this internal energy                  is the process of ion/surface collision.  Ion/surface                           collisions result in surface induced dissociation and reactions                 with the surface which can be used to obtain structural                         information about the molecules involved.  This research                        project addresses the fundamental ion/surface interaction                       chemistry which forms the basis for this analytical approach.",
