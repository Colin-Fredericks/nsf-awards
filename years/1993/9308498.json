 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308498  Ramani       Thermoplastic matrix fiber components are predominantly  manufactured using intermediate material forms such as prepregs,  tapes or towpregs, which reduces manufacturing and design  flexibility, and increases the product costs.  Even resins that  are synthesized in powder form are converted to pellets and melt  impregnated on glass fibers to manufacture short fiber composites.   Several processing steps for the manufacture of the final component  are wasteful from both manufacturing time, processing and design  flexibility, and energy considerations.  The primary objective of  this research is to develop a single continuous process for   impregnating and consolidating polymeric powders in continuous  fibers to manufacture components to net shape.  This process is  extended to encapsulate ceramic powder with polymeric powder on  continuous fibers.  The impregnation is accomplished by  electrostatic spray deposition and adhesion to the fiber tow, rapid  heating, and consolidation in a filament winding or pultrusion  process.  Process models are developed for each sub-process and  integrated during the process development cycle.       Development and demonstration of this process will directly  lead to minimizing the processing steps and reducing the associated  costs.  This process can be used for direct manufacture of filament  wound, pultruded components and resin encapsulated glass fibers for  injection molding and extrusion processes.  Ceramic powder  encapsulated tows can be used for the manufacture of continuous  fiber ceramic composites and composites with ceramic particles as  a filler in tribological situations.",
