What are the functions of target genes of  homeoproteins? What are the specific control elements through which  homeoproteins exert their identity functions? What are the  molecular bases for the phenomena of phenotypic suppression? By  addressing these questions, this work will provide insight into how  homeotic selector genes control morphogenesis. decapentaplegic  (dpp) is under homeotic control. dpp expression in parasegment 7 of  the embryonic visceral mesoderm (vm) requires normal function of  Ultrabithorax (Ubx); in addition, ectopic expression of Ubx leads  to ectopic expression of dpp. Ubx protein (UBX) binds to the dpp  site in polytene chromosomes. A 600 base pare dpp enhancer (vm-en),  identified by immunoprecipitation with purified UBX, confers  regulation by Ubx in the vm. Two adjacent UBX binding sites in vm-  en have been defined by DNAse I footprinting. Sequences in vm-en  required for enhancer function will be defined by deletion  analysis. Site directed mutagenesis will be carried out to  determine: 1) the function of UBX binding sites in vivo and 2)  whether UBX regulates dpp directly. Lack of function mutations in  either Ubx or dpp disrupt midgut morphogenesis by causing the lack  of the second midgut constriction. A vm-en dpp transgene able to  rescue this mutant dpp phenotype has been constructed. This  transgene will be used to investigate directly the role of specific  vm-en sequences, including the UBX binding sites, in midgut  morphogenesis. abdominal-A (abd-A) completely represses dpp in  parasegment 8 of the vm. This repression is also conferred by vm-en  but is not a consequence of abd-A repressing Ubx. Hence, the vm-en  is an ideal tool to investigate a general phenomena of epistasis  among homeotic proteins known as phenotypic suppression.  A 450-  base pair dpp embryonic ectoderm enhancer (ee-en)  has also been  identified by immunoprecipitation with UBX and the possible  function of dpp in PNS development and the roles of ee-en and its  homeodomain binding sites will be studied. The investigation of the  control of segment-specific morphogenesis by Drosophila  homeoproteins is likely to be of general interest because of the  evolutionary conservation of homeotic/Hox genes from Drosophila to  humans. The control of segment specific functions of dpp by  homeotic genes is particularly relevant because many proteins of  the TGF-beta family have been implicated in a variety of essential  developmental functions in vertebrates.  ***",
