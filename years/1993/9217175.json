 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vocal learning has evolved independently and is widespread in two               distinct groups of birds, songbirds and parrots.  Thus, parrots                 and songbirds have both independently solved similar neurological               and developmental problems related to vocal learning.  Contrast                 and comparison of vocal learning in songbirds and parrots can                   then provide insight into the underlying biological processes of                this complex learned behavior.  To best understand these                        processes, many different researchers simultaneously study                      behavior, development, perception, hearing, and neuroanatomy of a               few key species.  The parrot species that is receiving the most                 study in the laboratory setting is the domesticated Australian                  parakeet, the budgerigar; however, little field work has been                   done.  Further, it is unknown if the domesticated form, which has               received so much study, has diverged from the wild form.                                                                                                        Dr. Farabaugh will describe the vocal behavior and repertoires of               wild budgerigars and will bring back 20 wild budgerigars to the                 University of Maryland in order to test their hearing and                       perception of sound.  From these data, she will be able to                      address the function of vocal learning in budgerigars as well as                determine to what degree domesticated budgerigars are different                 from the wild form.  A lack of difference would support the                     studies already conducted on captive domesticated budgerigars.                  Alternatively, the discovery of differences would open new                      avenues of profitable comparative research investigating the                    neurological underpinnings of the observed differences.                                                                                                         This research is important because it will provide basic                        behavioral data on the key parrot species for intensive study of                vocal learning.  This data base will allow comparison and                       contrast not only of wild and domestic budgerigars but also of                  parrots and songbirds.  Such comparative studies increase our                   understanding of the basic biological processes that underlie                   complex learned behavior in all species, including humans.",
