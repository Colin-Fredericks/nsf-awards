 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                 Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                     incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is               necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                 that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress               has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                   progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                  reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                                                                                                    The goal of this project is to determine the atmosphere to snow                 transfer function for chemical species whose deposition is                      reversible, i.e. ones that can move from the snow back into the                 atmosphere to be removed or redeposited elsewhere.  The two species             to be investigated are hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde.  Based               on measurements of their concentration in the free atmosphere, in               the air within the snow, as well as in snow, and ice, a transfer                model will be developed.  Concurrent laboratory studies will be                 done to determine and constrain model parameters such as chemical               equilibrium coefficients and mass transfer coefficients.  The model             will be generalized to other reactive species, such as nitric acid,             and organic acids.",
