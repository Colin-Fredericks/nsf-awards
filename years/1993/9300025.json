 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a program of research, development and technology                  transfer of a multimedia conceptual design aid, the Concept                     Database.  The Concept Database provides design teams with easy                 access to information with regard to life cycle design issues for               competing design concepts and access to relevant past designs and               other information databases of the engineering enterprise.  The                 Concept Database methodology provides \"smart navigation\" through                a hypermedia database of linked design concepts.  Such a system                 expands the amount of information available to the designer and                 other members of the product development team in a manner that is               selective, using search techniques that are based on heuristic,                 deterministic, and decision-analytic methods.  Normative design                 methodologies are used to develop the structure of the search in                order to guarantee that the full range of life cycle issues are                 considered and provides a framework for making design decisions                 that take account of multiple and often conflicting life cycle                  objectives.                                                                          Mechatronic design is the domain of the first prototype                    system.  Mechatronic design is an area of key strategic                         importance, playing an important role in the design of consumer                 products, computer peripherals, automation systems, and aerospace               and defense systems.  It is also an area where off-the-shelf                    component selection is essential, and one in which the expertise                crosses departmental boundaries; electronic design, mechanical                  design, interface design, supplier coordination, packaging,                     logistics and support are all involved in the realization of a good             mechatronic system design.",
