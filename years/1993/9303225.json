 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves three research projects in                           mathematical analysis.  The first concerns the change in spectrum               of the Laplace operator defined on automorphic functions in the                 upper half plane modulo a confinite subgroup of SL(2,R).  The                   goal is to show that for the generic case, the asymptotic                       distribution of eigenvalues is less than the Weyl distribution                  calls for.  The second area focuses on the circle problem in                    hyperbolic space which, in its simplest form, compares the number               of lattice points in a plane contained in a circle with the area                of the circle.  Asymptotic values for the relationship have                     been steadily improved although comparisons with the Euclidean                  case are of no value. Work is proceeding on estimates of the                    error term in the cocompact case.  Finally, work is continuing on               scattering theory for symmetric spaces of noncompact type.                      Although this was developed in the 1970's, some of the published                work contains gaps (in addition to being quite                                  complicated). Efforts will be made to find a simpler and more                   coherent treatment - and to fill the gaps.                                           Scattering theory arises in many contexts where one is able                to measure the outcome of an event in which hidden obstacles                    are present.  The theory seeks to extract information about                     the obstacles in terms of the initial and final data.",
