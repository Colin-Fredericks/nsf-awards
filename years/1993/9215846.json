 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is the manufacture of net shapes of                 high performance composites at high rates via high production rate              plasma spray technology.  If such shapes can be quickly produced                from a variety of materials, product design and even manufacture                can be greatly expedited.  The spray forming of net shapes is                   currently limited by a lack of understanding of the materials                   science and process science bases of the technology.  The  project              will address the key issues related to this technology in order to              optimize water-stabilized plasma (WSP) and electromagnetically                  coalesced plasma (EMCP) processing.  An interdisciplinary program               will be developed for process diagnostics/modelling and                         microstructural and mechanical characterization of the deposit.                 Industrial collaborators are an integral part of the research team              that has been formed to address plasma-based manufacture of net                 shapes.                                                                              The high powered water-stabilized DC plasma torch and                      electromagnetically coalesced torch may enable production of free-              standing structural forms, comprised of ceramics, metal alloys and              composite materials.  WSP spray processing of materials can be                  carried out at considerably higher temperatures than is possible                for gas-stabilized plasmas (viz. 30,000K versus 15,000K).  The EMCP             route enables the spray-forming of ceramics or composites from feed             materials that are in the liquid or slurry forms.  These processes              permit the use of both larger particulate-sized feedstock powders               and an increase in spray processing through-put by at least an                  order of magnitude; i.e., from 5 to 50 kg of alumina (for                       example) per hour.",
