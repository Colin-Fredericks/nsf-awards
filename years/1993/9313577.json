 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313577  Marshall    Under the direction of Dr. Fiona Marshall, Mr. Kennedy Mutundu will  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will interview  Mukogodo peoples who live in northern Kenya and will also excavate  two rock shelters which were inhabited by them in historic times.  The Mukogodo are, from an anthropological perspective, extremely  important because they are one of the few African groups which  followed a hunting and gathering way of life until recent times.  Within the lifetime of living tribal members, they obtained  livestock from herding neighbors and became pastoralists. In the  course of their yearly rounds this group also occupied a number of  known rock shelters or overhangs and preliminary information  indicates that these contain stratified material remains which both  document the earlier way of life and the transition to pastoralism.  Mr. Mutundu will excavate two of these and collect faunal as well  as other cultural remains. Given excellent historical data as well  as detailed information from the final occupants of these sites he  will be able to relate subsistence pattern with archaeological  signature.    This research is important because it provides an insight into a  process which took place over almost all of Africa and much of the  rest of the world in prehistoric times. In many regions peoples who  lived by hunting and gathering gradually changed their way of  subsistence after contact with pastoral populations. This  transition is extremely interesting to archaeologists because it  provides a context to study culture change. When confronted by a  new subsistence source, what are the processes involved in the  rejection or the acceptance and incorporation of it? Preliminary  data indicates that this process differed in varying regions. The  problem that archaeologists face is that it is difficult to  determine what constitutes a pastoral \"signature\" in the  archaeological record since domestic animals per se may also be  obtained through trade or theft.  The Mukogodo situation, because of  the excellent historical and ethnographic control, provides a  controlled case in which to examine this question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will yield  archaeological tools which may be useful in many parts of the  world. It will capture data which otherwise soon would be  irretrievably lost and finally it will contribute to the training  of a promising young scientist.  ***",
