 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Paul Renee and his                 collaborators will establish a paleomagnetic dating laboratory at               the Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley California. They will                obtain both cryogenic and spinner magnetometers and house them in               a magnetically shielded space. The cryogenic magnetometer will                  have automated alternating field demagnetization and measurement                capability. The laboratory also will feature a conventional                     tumbling AF demagnetizer and a thermal demagnetization oven,                    magnetic susceptibility bridge and extensive computational and                  graphics capabilities. The facility will conduct a number of                    research projects, many of which relate to paleoanthropological                 investigations. These include refinement of the paleomagnetic                   time scale and the dating of samples from sites which have                      yielded archaeological and fossil hominid remains.                                                                                                              Scientists have made use of the fact that the earth's magnetic                  field periodically reverses. Research over many years has                       produced a sequence of these reversals and determined the                       approximate age of each. Because iron particles in sediments                    align with the earth's magnetic field at time of deposition, they               in essence provide a compass and scientists can sample geological               sections and determine the position of the earth's magnetic pole                at particular moments in time. Through reference to a dated                     master sequence, approximate age can then be determined. This                   procedure has proven invaluable to geologists,                                  paleoanthropologists and other researchers who wish to date                     specific events in the past. Currently sufficient laboratory                    capacity does not exist in the United States to meet demand and                 the establishment of a facility at the Institute for Human                      Origins will help to remedy the situation.                                                                                                                      This project is important for several reasons. Research conducted               at the laboratory will help to refine paleomagnetic dating by                   providing more accurate dates for individual reversals. Samples                 dated by the laboratory will help to answer a number of pressing                scientific questions.",
