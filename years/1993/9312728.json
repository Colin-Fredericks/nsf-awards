The PI  and a graduate student from the Department of  Geology and Geophysics at the University of  Missouri-Rolla will collaborate with Dr.  Gabriele I.C. Schneider, chief geologist at the  Geological Survey of Namibia, in studying the  deposits and collecting specimens for  subsequent laboratory study at UMR and in  Namibia.  The Namibian partner will travel to  Rolla during the third year to participate in  the development of conclusions from  the field and laboratory research.    This research will document several fundamental  aspects of the mineral deposit at Okorusu which  have not been studied to date, including:  mineralogy, paragenetic sequence, fluid  inclusion geothermometry and salinities, rare  earth element geochemistry, trace element  geochemistry, and the character of  apatite-fluorite intergrowths.  This study  could improve understanding of the  origin of fluorite deposits, explaining why a  few carbonatites contain economic  concentrations of fluorite, whereas most do  not.  The project also promises practical  applications of interest to the Okorusu mining  operation - improving separation of apatite and  fluorite in order to produce superior fluorite  concentrate.  Since somewhat similar deposits  occur in parts of the U.S., the economic as  well as the scientific implications of the  research could be mutually beneficial.     In addition to the benefits outlined above,  this project advances the Division of  International Programs' objective of  strengthening human resources:  it offers a US  graduate student an opportunity for field  experience in a collaborative research project  with a distinguished scientist in Africa, who  also happens to be female.   ***",
