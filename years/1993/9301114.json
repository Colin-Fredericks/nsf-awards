 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the study of equations (both differential              and difference) on affine Hecke algebras introduced by the                      principal investigator which leads to a new approach to the theory              of special functions and combinatorics via the representation                   theory of Hecke algebras.  These equations are a generalization of              the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation from conformal field theory and             its difference counterpart.                                                          Conformal field theory is an important physical theory                     describing both two-dimensional critical phenomena in condensed                 matter physics and classical motions of strings in string theory.               Besides its importance in physics, the beautiful and rich                       mathematical structure of conformal field theory also has                       interested many mathematicians.  New relations between different                branches of mathematics, such as representations of                             infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and groups, Riemann surfaces and              algebraic curves, the Monster sporadic group, modular functions and             modular forms, elliptic genera, and knot theory, is revealed in the             study of conformal field theory.  It is believed that the study of              the mathematics involved in conformal field theory will lead to new             mathematical structures which will be important both in mathematics             and theoretical physics.",
