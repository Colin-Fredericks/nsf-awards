 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Drs. Stephen Plog and Malcolm Bell III, Mr.              Stephen Thompson will collect data for his doctoral dissertation.               He will conduct two seasons of survey work and analysis in a 150                square kilometer area around the site of Morgantina, a large                    hilltop settlement in east-central Sicily initially inhabited by                non-Greek peoples during the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age (ca. 1000 -              550 B.C.) and subsequently transformed during the second half of               the first millennium B.C. into a prominent Greek city state.                    Although extensive work has been done at the site itself, no formal             archaeological investigation has been conducted beyond the city                 walls. Consequently, only a rudimentary knowledge exists of the                 site's local and regional setting and of its immediate rural                    territory. Through his survey, Mr. Thompson will explore basic                  parameters of environment, settlement, demography and land use.                                                                                                 Through his work, Mr. Thompson wishes to address two basic issues.              First he wishes to reconstruct the social and economic organization             of this early Mediterranean state. It is extremely unclear how                  entities of this type integrate rural areas with urban centers and              how political and economic systems function. Secondly, he will                  address questions of assimilation and change. During the early part             of its history Morgantina appears to be an independent, indigenous              Sicilian development. Later however it seems to either come under               Greek influence or be dominated completely by Greece. How, over                 this interval, did relations between the center and the hinterland              change?  How was a new set of circumstances adapted to a                        traditional system?                                                                                                                                             This research is important for several reasons. It will set an                  major archaeological site into a broader context. It will shed new              light on development and change within state level societies and                finally will assist in the training of a promising young scientist.",
