 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beam dynamics problems relevant to the understanding of the                     coherent beam instabilities and the nonlinearity in the Cooler                  Ring will be investigated.  These research topics are                           indispensable to the effort of increasing luminosity at the IUCP                Cooler Ring and are also important to modern high brightness                    storage rings.  The proposed research is also important in                      training the accelerator physics graduate and undergraduate                     students.  The task A studies \"Impedances and Instabilities                     measurement of the Cooler\".  Topics of interest are coherent                    instabilities and preservation of small emittance beam in high                  energy (and high brightness) accelerators.  Using the measured                  beam transfer function, the impedance can be deduced.  Model                    simulation and analytic evaluation of the Vlasov equation will be               compared with experimental data.  These experiments will help to                understand better the current limitation of the Cooler Ring.  It                will also provide information for the design of damper system.                  Through this series of experiments, we will be able to understand               the dynamics of coherent instability and multidimensional Landau                damping on the coherent growth.  These experiment can also be                   important to Plasma physics.  The task B studies \"Phase and                     Amplitude Modulations in Parametric Resonances\".  The experiment                is to measure beam responses to the phase or amplitude                          modulations in the rf system.  These response functions are                     solutions of parametric resonant equations.  These experiments                  are important to understand the diffusion process in the                        longitudinal phase space.  Using the phase feedback loop, highly                damped parametric resonant system can be studied as well.                       Phenomena such as chaos, strange attractors, and bifurcations can               be measured.  With these experimental tools, we can set up an                   excellent laboratory for nonlinear dynamics.",
