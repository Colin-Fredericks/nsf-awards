 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks to carry out basic studies to determine the                  siting of U, Be, Sr and other cations in recent and old corals.  A              specific aim of the work is to determine whether these elements                 exist partly or primarily as adsorbed onto organic matter, or are               exclusively sited within the lattice.  This knowledge is an                     essential prerequisite for using corals as paleorecorders of wide-              ranging geophysical and geochemical information, e.g., oceanic                  234U/238U and 10Be/9Be ratios, seawater metal concentrations and                atmospheric 14C/12C ratios.  Our studies will attempt to assess                 whether coral compositions can be used for examining variability in             the geophysical parameter(s) of interest, and should help determine             the reliability of coral 14C/12C ratios, and also suggest suitable              methods to extract such information in a reliable manner, free of               effects due to diagenesis.  For example, if our studies show that               certain cations in corals are primarily adsorbed on organic matter,             the concentrations of those cations would be subject to exchange                with the environment.  To use such elements for paleoenvironment                studies, it would be necessary to extract cations from the                      aragonite lattice only.  We also propose to examine the suitability             of corals for determining surface oceanic 10Be/9Be ratios in the                past.  10Be is produced by cosmic ray nuclear interactions in the               atmosphere.  The 10Be half-life of 1.5 my promises to allow dating              corals of several millions of years' age from analyses of samples               of <50 gm weight.  The proposal is clearly exploratory in                       character, aiming at enhancing the potential of corals as recorders             of global paleoclimatic and paleo-oceanographic parameters.",
