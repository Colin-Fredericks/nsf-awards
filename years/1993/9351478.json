 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing the number of students, particularly the under-                      represented groups of non-white and female students, who major                  in mathematics and science is essential to the economic well-                   being of our country; and success in calculus is essential to                   majoring in mathematics and science. Engaging students in                       calculus courses when they work in small groups, explore                        mathematics with the use of technology, and produce a final                     product of which they can be proud is attracting many students                  who have not previously been attracted to mathematics or                        science. DeKalb College has a student population that is 29%                    non-white, and female students outnumber male students in a                     ratio of three to two. To provide calculus courses which open                   the door to the year 2000 and beyond for these and other two-                   year college students, this project is incorporating                            technology-based laboratories in DeKalb's calculus courses.                     These laboratories are actively engaging students in doing                      mathematics, and constructing coherent written arguments to                     support their laboratory findings is help these students form                   and understand important underlying mathematical concepts.                      Another advantage to two-year college students of technology-                   based laboratories is that it forces them to become members of                  laboratory groups, to meet outside of class, and to become                      familiar with available technology. Most students who attend                    residential colleges have these experiences, while students                     commuting to college and working part-time usually study alone                  and away from the campus. To accomplish the goal of providing                   technology-based laboratories in calculus courses, the project                  is providing four computer laboratories. DeKalb College is                      supporting workshops for faculty to select and modify                           laboratory materials and to train the faculty in the use of                     Mathematica. Local high school teachers of AP calculus and an                   advisory team of faculty from sister senior institutions is                     involved in the workshops. This provides valuable bridges for                   our college and its students as they progress from high school,                 to two-year college, to other colleges and universities.",
