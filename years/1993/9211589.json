 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a two year long-term visit by                      Professor John G. McHaffie, Department of Physiology, Medical                   College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University to Japan                  for a cooperative research project with Professor Masao Nortia,                 Department of Anatomy, School of Medicine, Niigata University.                  The researchers plan to undertake a study of direct and indirect                corticotectal relationships.  Study of interactions between                     cerebral cortex and superior colliculus are extremely important                 because this is the circuitory which controls visual orienting                  movements and foveation eye movements.  Indirect pathways act in                a permissive manner, while the direct pathway acts in an active                 manner.  There is little understanding of the anatomical and                    physiological details of these two systems.  The researchers will               study the functional significance of the indirect pathway from                  the cortex via the basal ganglia to the substantia nigra of the                 tegmentum and thence to the superior colliculus.                                     Results of the research will provide valuable insights into                commonalities among the different sensory systems, with added                   information regarding the interface between sensory and motor                   (striato-nigral) systems.  The results may have major                           implications for understanding the disorder of Parkinsonism.                    Professor McHaffie is an experienced electrophysiologist who has                participated in several neuroanatomical studies.  Professor                     Norita is a well-established neuroanatomist with a distinguished                laboratory and the appropriate institutional resources available                for the research.  The researchers' previous record of successful               collaboration and their common interests should provide a                       mutually beneficial interaction.",
