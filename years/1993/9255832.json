 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan State University's Physics-Astronomy Department will host              the seventh National Conference of Black Physics Students (NCBPS)               in February 1993.  NCBPS'93 will be the continuation of a sequence              of such annual conferences that began in 1987.  The motivation for              the NCBPS is to assist and encourage those African-American                     students who have shown interest and ability in physics to enter                and complete Ph.D. programs, and to initiate research careers in                Physics.  The idea for this conference series came from African-                American physics graduate students, and the conferences have been               organized and executed by students, with faculty and staff                      assistance at the host institutions (Howard, MIT, Hampton, Southern             University and Stanford hosted the conference in the                            past).  The following data illustrates the level of participation               by students from 1987 through 1992.                                                                                                                             1987      MIT                 34                                                1988      MIT                 68                                                1989      Howard Univ.        124                                               1990      Southern Univ.      140                                               1991      Hampton Univ.       150                                               1992      Stanford Univ.      150*                                              *(50 additional applicants were turned away due to lack of funds)                                                                                               The format of the conference includes lectures by distinguished                 physicists, research papers by current Black graduate and                       undergraduate students, and workshops on applying to and                        successfully completing a graduate program in physics.  The primary             audience for the conference are undergraduate students who are                  majoring in physics, or who have expressed an interest in physics.              A principal goal of the conference is to permit these students, who             are in the process of making career decisions that will shape the               course of their working lives, to meet and interact with Black                  graduate students, and Black scientists who can serve as role                   models and mentors.  The conference will be financed by grants from             MSU, corporate gifts solicited by MSU's College of Natural Science              Development Office, and grants which are being requested from                   NSF,NASA, DOE, and ONR.                                                                                                                                         The organization and program of the conference will be arranged by              the faculty, staff and graduate students, African-American and non-             African-American, of the Department of Physics and Astronomy of                 Michigan State University with assistance from the National                     Executive Committee of Minorities in the Physical Sciences (MIPS).",
