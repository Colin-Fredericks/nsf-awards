 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project introduces a framework for inference using                         qualitative and quantitative information.  It is designed for                   applications where the researcher is faced with the problem of                  drawing inferences of an unobservable state variable in a time                  series context.  Quantitative information is taken to be                        observable time series variables.  Qualitative information is                   taken to be an indicator (dummy) variable that is coded by the                  researcher and that reflects the researcher's distillation of                   literary materials that is believed to contain information about                the true unobserved state variable.  The framework is based on an               iterative algorithm that produces an inference oaf the                          unobservable for each sample period using the two types of                      information and presents a probabilistic assessment of how useful               an indicator of the true unobserved state is the indicator                      variable proposed by the researcher.                                                                                                                            The framework's output fills a gap in the applied                               macroeconometric literature that was created by the recent                      revival of interest in the use of qualitative information in                    macroeconomic analysis.  It also complements classical regression               analysis in cases where qualitative events are important by                     providing a novel way of assessing dummy variables.  Finally,                   theoretical applications of the approach to inference suggest                   that the algorithm could be used by policymakers when policy                    depends in part on an inference of an unobservable.",
