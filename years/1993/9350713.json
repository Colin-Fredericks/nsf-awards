 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Biology Through Computer-aided Instruction                             This project involves a new course in Mathematical Biology                  that is designed to teach students to think mathematically and                  be able to solve problems within the context of the biological                  sciences. A key point in realizing this goal is that                            mathematical understanding and problem solving ability are                      different from the skills of mathematical computation.                          Mathematical Biology also teaches students to formulate the                     description of quantitative problems in terms of mathematical                   operations. Accordingly, an interactive program is being                        implemented by use of the computer program Mathematica running                  on a network of workstation computers. The course emphasizes                    four important themes. During laboratory sessions data are                      simulated on the computer and flow into a computer aided                        analysis system. Experiments, the laboratory notebook, the                      calculator and worksheets, and final reports are integrated                     into one system. Mathematical Biology is taught as a sophomore                  course, and is expected to build on  biological principles                      learned in general biology and prepare students for the use of                  mathematics in upper division biology courses.",
