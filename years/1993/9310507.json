 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigation explores the relevant attitudes and                 campaign activities of delegates to the 1992 Republican and                     Democratic party presidential nominating conventions.  The                      delegates are important because they are not only involved in the               process of selecting the presidential nominees, they also mobilize              and provide the resources that sustain presidential election                    campaigns.  They not only help elect the president, they provide                the context within which a new president shapes his administration.             They also help define the political parties and structure the                   political images and the institutional bases of partisan activities             for the party's rank and file as well as for the larger electorate.                                                                                             The activity of these partisans is usually not limited to                       attendance at the national nominating conventions.  They are also               occupied with local, county or state political affairs.  The                    delegates include elected public officials and party officers at                every level, as well as many who have no aspiration for a political             career.  They by no means include all of the active participants in             presidential electoral politics, but they do represent virtually                all types and categories of presidential campaign activists.                                                                                                    The study employs a mail questionnaire sent to all delegates from               both parties attending the nominating conventions in 1992.  It  is              a multi-purpose study organized around three sets of objectives.                The first objective is an analysis of the level of agreement                    between the goals of the political elite and those of the mass                  electorate.  Second, the investigators expand previous studies of               the communication networks among the individuals located at all                 levels of presidential political activity.  Finally, they place                 these two objectives within the context of the transitions taking               place in and around both parties.  The Democrats have opted for a               new generation of leadership, while the GOP is facing turnover in               its leadership.  The comparisons of the 1992 elites with their                  counterparts in the post-Carter and post-Reagan eras will be an                 invaluable documentation of change in contemporary politics.  The               data collection will be timely because the immediate baseline for               monitoring changes within the parties has been established with                 comparable data collections in 1980, 1984 and 1988.",
