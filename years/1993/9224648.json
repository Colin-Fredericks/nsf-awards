 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze three broad issues:                   machine replacement and aggregate business fluctuations, team                   dynamics, and business cycle behavior.  The first topic involves                the aggregate implication of machine replacement which entails                  the replacement of old machines with new, more productive ones.                 Previous work has focused on seasonal fluctuations induced by                   retooling in the automobile industry during the both interwar and               post WW II periods.  The extensions will involve looking more                   broadly over other industries to focus on the connection between                machine replacement and the business cycle and to evaluate                      competing theoretical models of seasonal productivity                           fluctuations.  The second topic concerns the relationship between               complementarities in the production process and the distribution                of income.  Here the assignment of individuals to teams (e.g.                   firms) is analyzed focusing on the induced dynamics of the income               distribution, paying particular attention to persistent income                  inequality.  The third topic continues previous work on net                     business formation, bank runs, and the importance of                            technological non-convexities for aggregate fluctuations.  This                 research is important because it will provide a better                          understanding of factors influencing economic fluctuations and                  the distribution of income.",
