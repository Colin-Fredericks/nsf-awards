 "awd_abstract_narration": "The South Pole Air Shower Experiment (SPASE) is a large                         (approximately 100 meter square) array of scintillation detectors               which measures very energetic particles produced by interactions of             cosmic ray with the Earth's atmosphere.  Spase was first installed              at South Pole in late 1987 and has operated almost continuously                 since then with several improvements.  The experiment is intended               to search for sources of gamma rays with the expectation that such              sources would also be the long sought sources of charged cosmic                 rays.  In the first 5 years of operation SPASE has not found an                 unambiguous constant source, though there is a candidate.  There                are also candidate pulsed sources which may have been detected.                 These results are consistent with all similar experiment in the                 Southern Hemisphere.  It is planned to operate SPASE in conjunction             with the new detectors which are being installed as part of the                 AMANDA (Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array).  These new                 detectors will provide additional information on the muon content               of the air showers and therefore reduce the charged cosmic ray                  background and increase the likelihood of detection of gamma rays.",
