 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leaf growth responses to light are important for a plant to                     maximize its photosynthetic capacity while conserving available                 nutrients and water.  Leaf growth is stimulated photo-                          morphogenically by red and blue light acting by separate                        mechanisms, and is enhanced by photosynthesis occurring in the                  growing cells.  The growth response to light is associated with                 proton efflux, and other ion fluxes across the plasma membrane.                 The objectives of this study are to ask:  1. How is the plasma                  membrane proton pump regulated by light in epidermal and mesophyll              cells?  2. Are light-induced ion fluxes in leaf cells carried in                part by ion channels, and if so, does light regulate channel                    activity?  3. Will mutants defective in growth responses to light               exhibit altered electrical responses to light?  These questions                 will be approached by electrophysiological (microelectrode and                  patch clamp) techniques taking advantage of mutants of Arabidopsis              showing altered growth responses to light.                                      %%%                                                                             Leaf growth responses to light are important for a plant to                     maximize its ability to carry out photosynthesis while conserving               available nutrients and water.  Leaf growth is stimulated by red                and blue light and is enhanced by photosynthesis occurring in the               growing cells.  The growth response to light is associated with ion             fluxes across the cell membrane.  This project will use electrical              techniques to study the mechanisms by which ions move across the                membranes of leaf cells in response to light.  The results of this              research will clarify the initial events occurring in light                     responses of growing leaf cells.",
