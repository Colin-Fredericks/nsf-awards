It is a follow-up, extension, and improvement of a               pilot survey completed earlier.  The National Association of                    Manufacturers is cooperating and partially supporting this study.               Both \"hard and soft\" technologies are included.  The sample of                  plants is about 5,000 requests to complete the survey form and                  include firms or all sizes.                                                                                                                                     Respondents are asked to indicate their skill level with regard                 to each technology, reasons for adoption or non-adoption, changes               over the recent past, and plans for the near future.  Measures of               output will be related to individual production technology used                 by industry.  Aggregate results to be reported in a report,                     professional journals, trade press and the data and information                 collected (without firm/plant identifiers) to be made available                 to others",
