 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305308  Brown  The H1 histones are a multigene family of chromosomal proteins that are critically involved in  organizing chromatin structure.  H1s are major substrates for growth-related protein kinases and  phosphorylation of H1 proteins has been suggested to be particularly important in regulated changes in  chromatin condensation during cell cycle progression.  The objective of this proposal is to identify and  investigate some of the structural features of the different H1 variants that are important to their  function in chromatin organization.  Over the past several years we have developed a system in which  genes for different H1 variants have been cloned into inducible overexpression vectors and transfected  into homologous mouse fibroblasts.  These transformants can be induced to overexpress the different H1  genes such that the product of the exogenous gene is the predominant H1 in chromatin.  We have  recently demonstrated that a transient inhibition of DNA replication can be induced in some of the H1  variant overproducing-cell lines.  This inhibition is associated with a high H1/nucleosome ratio.   Interestingly, different H1 variants exhibit a different ability to maintain a high H1/nucleosome ratio.   For these proposed studies the cloned mouse histone genes will be systematically mutagenized in vitro  prior to transformation.  We will apply a number of  in vivo and in vitro assays to these transformed  cells to determine the effects of these mutations on replication and chromatin conformation.  Particular  emphasis will be placed on modification of the putative sites of phosphorylation of the histone H1 that  are believed to be important  in cell cycle-regulated alterations in chromatin conformation.  We will  also attempt to identifying the domains that lead to H1 variant specific effects on the cellular capacity to  replicate by constructing hybrid genes in which the coding portions of the major structural domains of  H1 and H1c have been systematically exchanged.  The result s obtained will be the basis of further  studies that will define the role of H1, H1 variants, and specific structural features  of H1s, in  chromatin.  %%%  The H1 histones are a family of proteins involved in packaging the genetic material.  Correlative data  has associated changes in histone content with alterations in cellular division.  The object of these  studies is to identify structural features of various key members of this protein family that affect a cells  capacity to replicate.  We have clones of the genes for various H1proteins.  We will systematically alter  sequences in these cloned genes and introduce them into cultured mouse cells in such a manner that  they are overexpressed and replace most of the cells preexisting H1 histones.  We will then determine  the effects these alterations have on the cells capacity to divide,  We already know that the H1 product  of one gene inhibits replication and the H1 product of another gene has no apparent effect on  replication.  Our studies will focus on the structural features of these two genes that set them  functionally apart.  The results will provide a basis for further studies that will specifically define the  role various members of the H1 protein family and their various structural features play in cell growth.   Such an understanding will extend our understanding of the mechanism of cell division and how it  relates to differentiation and unregulated cell growth characteristic of oncogenesis.  ***",
