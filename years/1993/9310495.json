 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310495  Becker    The usual assumption in most discussions over time is that choices  today are not directly dependent on choices in the past.  The  assumption of independence is not \"nonsense,\" for it usefully  simplifies many problems that are not crucially affected by  dependencies over time.  But the assumption has discouraged  economists from grappling with other issues of considerable  significance -- including addictions, work habits, preference  formation, why children support their elderly parents, preference  solutions to the problem of future commitments, and the evolution  and stability of institutions.    This project considers how a person's current preferences depend on  past experiences, and on the behavior of others.  The influence of  the past is illustrated by habitual behavior, defined as behavior  that displays a positive relation between the past and current  consumptions of a good, such as drugs.  The influence of others is  illustrated by peer pressure, which may induce a teenager to start  smoking.  In essence, therefore, the project will consider the  rational formation of preferences.  The process is \"rational\" in  the sense that a person is assumed to try to anticipate the  consequences for his future preferences of what he does now,  including groups with which he associates.  The assumption of  forward-looking and consistent behavior provides rules and  implications that determine how preferences evolve over time, and  in which groups.  This work tries to contribute to our knowledge of  these processes.    ***",
