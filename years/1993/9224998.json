Tradeoffs between production and distribution times are modeled and analyzed based on the investigators, experiences with production distribution problems in the newspaper industry.  Newspapers are produced and distributed in the period of time from the start of the press run to the time the last paper is delivered to a subscriber's home.  Since several geographically zoned editions or products are produced and distributed, sequencing is important.  Newspapers are tracked from the production facilities to regional distribution centers where they are completed, rebundled and tracked to drop off points to be picked up by home delivery carriers.  Given the daily requirement, location, and edition of each home delivery route, the location of the printing facility(ies), and the total time available for production and distribution, the problem is to determine the cost minimizing combination of production and distribution system inputs including the number of presses and inserting machines; the number of vehicles serving distribution centers and drop off points; the number, location, and capacity of distribution centers and drop off points; and the routes taken by each vehicle.",
