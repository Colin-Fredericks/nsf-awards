 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318884  Denevan    Under the direction of Dr. William Denevan, Ms. Sarah Brooks will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will conduct  archaeological research in the Colca Valley of Peru and attempt to  date and determine the construction sequence of different kinds of  agricultural terraces located on the valley slopes. She will also  collect data which will permit reconstruction of climate change. To  answer the first question she will conduct a through survey of a 4  square km region with two terrace types and carry out partial or  complete excavations of 25 terraces and features physically  associated with them. She will also partially uncover several house  structures and canals. Analyses will be conducted on recovered  lithics, ceramics and faunal remains. Dates will be obtained  through comparative ceramic analyses, carbon 14 analyses of organic  materials and hydration of obsidian artifacts. To determine climate  change, analyses will be conducted both on pollen and macro faunal  materials collected during excavation.    Data resulting from the analysis of the Quelccaya ice cap near the  Colca Valley have indicated wet and dry periods from AD 500 to the  present. Limited studies of the region's prehistory indicate that  in the early sixth century AD farming practices changed and people  abandoned rainfed sloping field terraces and began to construct  counterparts which could be watered by irrigation. Ms. Brooks  wishes to examine the relationship between climate change and  postulated human response. She wishes to determine how rainfall and  vegetation changed in the region and whether the new farming  practices were in fact related to this shift.    This research is important for several reasons. Many areas in the  Andes which are unused today at one time supported intensive  agriculture. Reconstruction of past farming practices and discovery  the relationship between them and environmental variables may  provide insights of direct use for regional development today. In  t he course of her work Ms. Brooks will also produce a chronological  sequence of value to many archaeologists who work in highland Peru.  The project will assist in the training of a promising young  scientist.  ***",
