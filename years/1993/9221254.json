 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research focusses on an important evolutionary                problem - how closely related populations of recently diversified               species begin to diverge in their niche utilization patterns.  The              primary question is, when such groups live in the same area, do                 competitive forces drive them to begin to utilize different                     resources, or are they able to continue to subsist on the same                  sorts of regimens as other populations of their species, living                 separately.  Alternatively, are such groups driven to live in the               same area because of competition of each with other members of                  their species living in other areas.                                                 The principal investigator is very experienced and well                    regarded in the field, and has the necessary contacts in northeast              Zaire to carry out the work over the course of a year.  Besides the             evolutionary questions, this is the first long term study of                    primates in such a species rich area of Africa, and should be                   relevant to conservation interests.",
