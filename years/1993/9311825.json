 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the ultimate aims of \"nanostructure engineering\" has been                to develop structures containing as few as one electron.                        Recently, the key difficulties in the last few years in studying                the physics of nanostructures have not been in tailoring small                  structures; instead they have been in the measurement of the                    minuscule signals emanating from a system containing only a few                 electrons.  In this regard, new technique has been developed for                the detection of minute amounts of electrical charge.  This has                 allowed for a new high resolution spectroscopic tool known as                   \"Single-Electron Capacitance Spectroscopy\" (SECS).  The results                 so far indicate that this technique should become widely                        applicable to the study of few electron systems in                              nanostructures, single defects, and single impurity atoms.  The                 central theme of the work to be conducted here is the development               and extension of the SECS method to study a variety of basic                    physics and materials problems.                                                                                                                                 A top-loading dilution refrigerator and high field magnet system                will be of central utility in these measurements.  The                          refrigerator proposed here will allow rapid cooling of samples                  and can accommodate a variety of different experiments through                  the use of separate measurement probes.",
