 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S.-U.K. cooperative research in cell                      biology.  The investigators are Dominick and Margaret Basile of                 Lehman College, City University of New York, and Keith                          Roberts of the John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom.                   The research focuses on Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), which                  are cell-surface glycoproteins, and their role in cell proliferation.           AGPs are associated with numerous functions in the plasma                       membranes and extracellular matrix in plants.  Through the                      development of monoclonal antibodies, the investigators propose                 to identify AGPs associated with the suppression and                            desupression of cell proliferation in plants.  Once the AGPs                    associated with cell proliferation are isolated, they can be                    characterized and their genetic regulation and mechanism can be                 better investigated.                                                                                                                                            The U.S. investigators bring to this collaboration their work on                morphoregulation in liverworts and their recent findings on the                 involvement of AGPs in plant development.  This is                              complemented by the British investigator's expertise in producing               monoclonal antibodies and his skill in immunocytochemical                       localization of AGPs. Their combined efforts will advance our                   understanding of the growth processes in the development of                     multicellular organisms and in the function of AGPs in regulating               cell proliferation.",
