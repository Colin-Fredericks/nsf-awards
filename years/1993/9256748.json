This program provides training at the interface                   between the physical and engineering sciences, and the                          bimolecular sciences.  Trainees will be uniquely able to                        contribute to: a) to apply engineering principles to the                        development of new methods for the study of bimolecular systems                 including the human genome; and b) to create new engineering                    technologies based on bimolecules, molecular assemblies, and                    bimolecular processes.                                                                                                                                               Support from the University and the Whitaker Foundation have               been combined with pre-existing faculty strength to launch this                 program in the Center for Bioengineering.  Four new faculty with                expertise in areas of molecular science have been recruited.  In                addition, a new department of Molecular Biotechnology, with a                   core group of investigators from Cal Tech, is being established.                The Molecular Bioengineering faculty has thus grown from 5 to 13.               It is proposed that the current Molecular Bioengineering student                population of 15 be expanded to 40, using traineeships to support               21.  Given the importance of this emerging area, and Molecular                  Bioengineering's demonstrated ability to attract highly qualified               students (35% of whom are women), it is expected that graduates                 of the Molecular Bioengineering Program will become leaders in                  both academic and industry.",
