 "awd_abstract_narration": "If there is risk aversion relative to current period prices or                  interest rates, the tracking properties of all statistical index                numbers, including the Divisia and superlative index numbers, are               unknown.  Under the previous NSF grant, the investigator                        demonstrated that the tracking ability of the discrete time                     Divisia index is not seriously compromised by risk aversion.                    However, that study used data produced by the economy.  The use                 of data from the economy leaves many problems unanswered.  For                  example, it is possible that specification errors might be large                and might coincidentally offset the tracking error in the Divisia               index.  If that were true, the conclusion that the Divisia index                is robust to risk aversion might be wrong.  This project uses a                 Monte Carlo approach to generate simulated data in which only one               possible source of tracking error remains: the degree of risk                   aversion.  The results of this project are important for monetary               policy because monetary aggregates are used by monetary                         authorities to track the performance of the economy.  The                       research is also methodologically significant because it requires               computationally demanding replications of state of the art                      nonlinear rational expectations models.",
