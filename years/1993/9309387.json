 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309387  Iglesias  Research is proposed on investigating a minimum entropy H-inf  control problem for discrete-time, time-varying systems.  For  linear time-invariant systems, these controllers have shown to be  a very useful tool for designing practical controllers because they  provide a simple way of integrating the robustness of H-inf  controllers with the performance of linear quadratic Gaussian  optimal controllers.    The main theme of the proposed research is to use some very recent  developments in the representation of time-varying discrete-time  systems in order to develop a complete theory for several problems  in H-inf control for time-varying systems.  Part of the analysis  will include the recently introduced W-transform which is a  generalization of the usual Z- transform.  In addition to the  minimum entropy control problem, we will consider H-inf control for   time-varying systems defined over an infinite time interval, as  well as a modification of the H-inf control problem in which the  future time variations of the plant are not known.    The proposed research is expected to result in a new design  methodology for linear time-varying systems that has improved  performance as compared to the standard H-inf design, and improved  robustness as compared to the standard LQG design.  An additional  benefit of the proposed research is that the theory will strengthen  the interconnections between operator theory and H-inf control.  ***",
