 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313535  Bustos  Since its establishment in 1966, the Department of Biological  Sciences at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC),  has been committed to excellence in plant research.  The focus of  plant research projects has ranged from the physiology and  biochemistry of photosynthesis to plant development and molecular  biology.  Recent developments in plant biotechnology,  particularly transgenic plant research, require specialized  facilities that provide better environmental control capabilities  and containment of transgenic plant material.  Many of the  experimental techniques required for this research are impossible  to achieve with the existing conditions at UMBC's greenhouse  facility.    This ARI award will provide funding for the modernization of the  greenhouse facility.  New HVAC units, supplemental lighting and  an automatic drip-feed watering system will be provided, within  the facility, to sustain near optimal growth conditions annually.  The renovations will make more efficient use of available space,  furnish a wider range of growth habitants,  provide separate  areas for preparation and sterilization of growth media, and the  inspection and treatment of plant specimens.  Improving the  facility will allow the university to be in compliance with  federal regulations regarding the growth and harvest conditions  of genetically engineered plants.  Researchers and students will  be able to work on ten different species of plants, including  Arabidopsis.  The renovated facility will enhance the  university's ability to continue to attract students and faculty  with diverse backgrounds into this important field of science and  provide state-of-the-art training.  ***",
