 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is directed toward 1) identifying patterns                of landscape properties including soil texture; vegetation and                  micro- and macro-topography and 2) determining the way in which                 these patterns influence hydrologic behavior of a semi-arid                     catchment in eastern Washington state.  Because variations in these             landscape properties occur at various scales, observations of the               distributions will be made at scales ranging from field mapping to              low-and high-altitude aerial photography.  Spatial analysis                     techniques will be applied to mathematically characterize patterns              in the distributions of the hydrology-affecting properties.                     Patterns at successive scales will then be superimposed in an                   effort to determine how the interacting processes and their scale               dependencies reflect the basin hydrologic response.  The                        distributions of the hydrology-affecting properties on the                      landscape will be correlated to measured  hydrologic performance,               emphasizing infiltration and soil moisture because runoff is rare               in the region.  It is expected that these combinations of patterns              at various scales will be reflected in the dynamics of the                      hydrologic processes; including infiltration, evapotranspiration,               runoff, and recharge.  Description of landscape patterns and their              properties at different scales, along with their relationship to                hydrologic processes, should provide insight into the mechanisms                by which landscape features and hydrologic processes interact.",
