This is an extremely important line of research    because these methods permit empirical research to concentrate on   drawing economic inferences from data without risking potentially   large specification errors.  The basic idea is to replace the       structural model with an approximation that sequentially improves   as more information becomes available.  The methods developed by    this project permit reliable inference at each intermediate stage   of model evolution.  The procedures are general enough to           encompass most econometric inference procedures.  Under a           previous grant the investigator succeeded in developing             statistical methods that have certain advantages particularly       relevant to econometric applications: simplicity, ease of           implementation, and ease of extension to nonlinear, multivariate,   and time series applications.  Under this grant these methods       will be extended to a dynamic setting and used to analyze           financial markets.  As in the past, algorithms implementing the     theoretical and empirical work will be coded and documented to      current standards for professionally written, scientific software   and put in the public domain.                                                                                                           The methods developed under this project are termed                 seminonparametric (SNP) methods because they are parametric yet     have nonparametric properties.  The procedures replace the          structure models with a truncated series expansion, the error       density with a truncated expansion, or both.  By letting the        truncation grow adaptively with sample size, the approximation is   accurate enough at each intermediate stage to permit reliable       inference and ultimate convergence to th e underlying data          generating mechcanism.  Applications are made to conditionally      heterogeneous time series such as occur in finance and              macroeconomics.  Bayesian methods are also studied.  ***",
