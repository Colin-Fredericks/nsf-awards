The research program has abandoned the traditional areas of analytical, inorganic, organic and physical chemistry to pursue the field of materials, environmental, and biomedical chemistry.  These focus areas are strengths not only of the department, but of the university as well.  A resurgence in research and funding activities, and the recruitment of new faculty, has made it necessary to renovate and upgrade the department's two research and training buildings, Pearson and Michael laboratories, constructed in 1923 and 1968 respectively.  Although adequate space exits within the Pearson-Michael complex to meet the needs of anticipated faculty and students, the space is presently underutilized due to antiquated conditions.  Original laboratories are unusable because they are contain asbestos, have inadequate electrical and plumbing systems, and no operable fume hoods.  ARI funds have been requested to renovate laboratory space and the general infrastructure, specifically, the electrical and plumbing systems, HVAC and fire safety systems.  These renovations will allow faculty to consolidate their research activities that are currently dispersed over several locations in the two buildings.  Modernization of the facilities will provide a safe, well equipped environment for faculty and student to conduct research.                                                                                                                                                                                                               9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Fincode Text Only!
