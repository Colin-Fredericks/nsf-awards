 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to establish a Research Experience                    for Undergraduates SITE at the Center for the Study of                          Early Events in Photosynthesis at Arizona State University.                     Life on this planet is ultimately dependent on                                  photosynthesis for its energy requirements.  The Center,                        comprised of faculty in the departments of Botany and                           Chemistry and Biochemistry, takes an interdisciplinary                          approach to understanding the energy storage process carried                    out by photosynthetic organisms and mimicking photosynthesis                    using artificial systems.  Undergraduate students will                          participate in the individual research programs of the                          Center faculty. Projects will include organic synthesis and                     spectroscopic studies of photosynthetic model compounds,                        spectroscopic studies of bacterial and plant photosynthetic                     reaction centers, biochemical and molecular characterization                    of mutant reaction centers, and molecular biology and                           genetics of photosynthetic systems.  Structured interaction                     between faculty and student participants, including the                         weekly photosynthesis seminar series, research group                            meetings, instrumentation workshops and a concluding                            undergraduate symposium, will help educate the students in                      the extremely diverse modern approach to the study of                           photosynthesis. Student participants will be recruited from                     targeted colleges and universities in the Southwest United                      States with the help of local department chairs and                             individual faculty.",
