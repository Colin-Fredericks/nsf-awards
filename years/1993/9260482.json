 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electric and electronic properties of insulators are difficult              to measure by conventional methods which apply metal contacts to                the insulator surfaces.  A new technique has shown great potential.             It enables determination of contact-free, previously unmeasurable               fundamental properties of materials, especially of materials with               very low charge carrier concentrations and of semiconductors.  The              technique consists of measuring the dielectric polarization in an               electric field gradient.  By deconvoluting the various components               of the dielectric polarization, bulk and surface contributions can              be separated.  Thus, unique information is obtained about surface               charges, their sign and density as well as their associated                     internal field.  The method is also highly sensitive to changes in              the bulk polarization such as may be caused by the dissociation of              defects and generation of mobile charges.  By applying a static                 electric field gradient and measuring the response as a function of             time, processes with long relaxation times, of the order of seconds             to hours, can be evaluated.  Such processes may be due to charge                carriers with very low drift mobilities which, however, may play an             important part in determining the long-term stability of electronic             devices or ferroelectrics.  The objective of the research is to                 develop a Charge Distribution Probe which allows one to perform                 measurements with high spatial resolution and determine the                     electronic properties of thin insulator layers.",
