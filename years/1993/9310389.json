 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310389  Shreeve  Professors Shreeve and Kirchmeier of the University of Idaho  will investigate the synthesis of fluorophosphazenes with  support from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program.  Although synthetic phosphazene chemistry  has been a fertile area of research for many years, the  fluorophosphazenes have been relatively untouched.  Shreeve and  Kirchmeier will prepare cyclophosphazenes as well as  polyphosphazenes with fluorine atoms attached both to the  skeletal atoms as well as to substituent groups such as  fluoroalkoxides, fluorophenoxides, and fluoroalkyls.  Many of  the syntheses will take advantage of fluoro-organosilanes as  reagents to introduce the fluoro-groups into the phosphazenes.  It is anticipated that the phosphazenes, already a promising  class of compounds, will display improved properties in their  fluorinated forms.  %%%  There is a class of inorganic compounds, called the  phosphazenes, which are similar to organic compounds in the  sense that they are constructed around a skeleton of linked  atoms; however, instead of carbon atoms the skeleton is made  of alternating phosphorus and nitrogen atoms.  Phosphazenes can  be prepared both as discrete molecules and as polymers, and  they are finding certain commercial applications.  Just as  Teflon is related to simple organic compounds through the  replacement of hydrogen with fluorine atoms, in the present  research project a series of fluorine-substituted phosphazenes  will be prepared.  The basic chemistry of these compounds will  be explored, but it is anticipated that they will display  improved properties relative to their unfluorinated relatives.  ***",
