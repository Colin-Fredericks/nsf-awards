 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Winifred Creamer will             analyze a large series of ceramic materials collected through                   archaeological excavation in the U.S. Southwest. She will also take             a series of computer, statistical and mathematics courses, mostly               at the University of Northern Illinois, to improve her analytic                 skill. This will permit her to approach her study using the most                appropriate techniques.                                                                                                                                         Anthropologists generally believe that Native American population               size decreased dramatically around the time of European contact.                However the exact nature, timing and cause of this decline probably             varied from area to area. It is also possible that in some regions              population was not affected. The Southwest is a particularly                    interesting both because of the high level of social complexity                 achieved before European contact and because decline seems to date              well before Spanish influence was felt. The largest ruins in the                Anasazi region were abandoned before Columbus arrived in the New                World. Dr. Creamer wishes to reconstruct Anasazi population size                both pre and post contact and learn how it changed over time. On                this basis she will try to understand the causal mechanisms                     involved. To do this however a fine-scale chronological control is              necessary and at the present time it is not possible to date sites              with sufficient accuracy. Dr. Creamer will study ceramic remains                which have been recovered in secure stratigraphic contexts, examine             how this body of material culture changes over time and then use                the ceramic sequence to date individual sites.                                                                                                                  In this Career Advancement Award, Dr. Creamer will also expand her              own skills. Research of this kind requires computer, statistical                and mathematic expertise which Dr. Creamer does not possess.                    Through a series of university courses and hands on learning she                will acquire the necessary expertise.                                                                                                                           This research is important for several reasons. It will provide                 information of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase                our understanding of the processes of culture change and contact                and finally it will assist in the training of an accomplished                   scientist.",
