 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will focus on how genetic variation is                                 distributed in natural populations of a filamentous                             mold, Aspergillus nidulans, and how it propagates                               itself in nature.  Molds like A. nidulans can produce                           clonal propagules called spores that are genetically                            exactly identical to their single parent.  Or, they can                         produce spores that are a genetic mixture of the two                            parents.  This research distinguish will between these                          two events by surveying genetic variation in natural                            populations.  Genetic markers have been identified that                         are variable between individuals in nature.  If only                            distinct combinations of markers are observed in any                            given individual, then reproduction is clonal.                                  However, if some individuals have markers that are                              combinations of those seen in others, then sexual                               reproduction occurs.                                                                                                                                            The Aspergilli are an important group of organisms.                             Many Aspergilli and their relatives are used to produce                         a variety of useful substances, such as antibiotics.                            Aspergillus flavus commonly grows on stored grain                               products, producing a powerful carcinogen called                                aflatoxin, a threat to livestock and humans.                                    Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus parasiticus can                           be human pathogens, commonly lethally infecting immune-                         compromised individuals.  While Aspergillus nidulans                            isn't a pathogen, it is a well-developed research                               organism, with tools for genetic analysis available                             that are not developed in other species.  Information                           about its population structure and how it propagates in                         nature should provide useful clues about the life                               histories of other molds.",
