Yuen, University of Minnesota, is to                                            investigate outstanding questions in solid                                      earth geophysics from theoretical and numerical                                 approaches.  They will study the problem of the                                 interaction between mantle convection and                                       movements of the Earth's rotational axis.  Of                                   special focus will be the quantitative                                          evaluation of large-scale mean-flow in the                                      Earth's mantle.  Additionally they will conduct                                 a detailed inversion study of the transport                                     properties inside the Earth from satellite                                      observations of the gravity field and internal                                  density fields inferred from seismology.  This                                  will be done using the latest experimental                                      constraints on the relationship between seismic                                 velocity variations and density changes.  Based                                 on their results , the researchers hope to                                      develop numerical algorithms suitable for                                       solving three-dimensional mantle convection                                     problems on supercomputers and for rapid                                        interpolation of large datasets needed for                                      graphics and visualization.                                                                                                                                     This research in geophysics fulfills the                                        program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    U.S. and Czech Republic to combine                                              complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.  Funds for the project are                                      awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund,                                        Prague, in accordance with established                                          guidelines.",
