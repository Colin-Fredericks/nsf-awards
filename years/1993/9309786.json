 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309786  Weigend  The progress in the last decade in  predicting and understanding time  series has been remarkable.  Where  once time series analysis was  shaped by linear systems theory, it  is now possible to recognize when  an apparently complicated time  series has been produced by a low-  dimensional nonlinear system,  characterize its essential  properties, and build a model that  can be used for prediction.  At the  opposite extreme, there is now a  much richer framework for designing  algorithms such as neural networks  that can learn and adapt to the  structure in time series that do  not have a simple origin.  This  research addresses the following  three questions:  How to estimate  the accuracy in time series  prediction, how to deal with data  sets that are noisy and chaotic,   and how to characterize the system  that temporal sequence by analyzing  the predictive model.  The tools to  be developed in response to these  questions combine recent advances  from connectionism and dynamical  systems theory.  They will be  evaluated on real-world data,  submitted by various groups for  consideration at the Time Series  Prediction and Analysis Competition  that was held under the auspices of  the Santa Fe Institute.  ***",
