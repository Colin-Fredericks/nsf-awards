 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adelie penguin colonies have an internal structure consisting of a              variety of distinct subcolonies. These subcolonies increase or                  decrease in size relatively independent from variations in the                  colony as a whole. The purpose of this project is to investigate                the dynamics of subcolony size at several large breeding colonies               of Adelie penguins in the Ross Sea, and evaluate the factors that               cause such variation. It is important to understand what causes                 these sometimes-contradictory patterns in order to understand the               dynamics of penguin populations as a whole. Observations at the                 northern colony at Cape Bird indicate that ice conditions and                   disturbance by visitors are significant factors that affect                     subcolony size. These factors will be addressed specifically. In                addition, methods of digital image analysis will be used to ease                the process of counting penguins from aerial photos. This research              will raise the sophistication of  our understanding of penguin                  population dynamics and also introduce more automated methods for               evaluating populations. Both these goals are of considerable                    importance to current major interests in Antarctic biology.",
