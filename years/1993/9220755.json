 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization between different species is an accident of                 nature that may in some instances have a very important outcome:                the origin of new species.  Hybrids are typically unable to                     reproduce through ordinary sexual means because they contain                    incompatible chromosomes that do not pair during meiosis, the                   reduction division that produces the haploid cells that ultimately              produce eggs and sperms.  However, a second accident, chromosome                doubling (polyploidy) may restore fertility by providing each                   chromosome with an exact duplicate with which it can pair. These                two processes, hybridization and polyploidy, have combined in this              way to produce a vast number of new plant species, termed                       allopolyploids.  Allopolyploids include some of our most important              crops, among them wheat, cotton, coffee, peanut, and tobacco.                   Nonetheless, surprisingly little is known about the precise                     cellular mechanisms that operate to produce allopolyploids, or                  about the circumstances that prevail in nature when successful                  allopolyploids become established.                                                    The present proposal is designed to bolster our knowledge of              the origin of allopolyploids through detailed studies of natural                hybrids between species of Dryopteris, a genus of ferns common in               eastern North America.  Dryopteris is an ideal model system for the             following reasons: (1) as a fern, the products of meiosis in                    Dryopteris are spores that can be grown directly into plants rather             than the pollen grains or embryo sacs of flowering plants which are             much less amenable to further study; (2) Dryopteris plants are large            and produce numerous spores, offering an enhanced opportunity to                observe relatively rare events; (3) numerous hybrids are produce in             nature, some of them very frequently, allowing for the variation                between processes that pertain to individual kinds of hybrids to be             evaluated.                                                                            This study will consist of two phases, a laboratory phase and             a field phase.  In the laboratory, the production of spores with                doubled chromosomes will be followed.  Such spores are believed to              be distinguishable as large spherical (\"giant\") spores that stand               out from the remainder of the shriveled spores ordinarily produced              by the hybrid.  The genetic constitution and growth potential of                these \"giant\" spores will be evaluated by growing them into                     juvenile ferns (gametophytes) and examining these using molecular               and microscopic techniques.  Attempts will also be made to produce              adult ferns (sporophytes) from the gametophytes by both sexual and              asexual means.  In the field, clusters of hybrids will be studied               to determine whether they are actually reproducing through                      polyploid spores, i.e. whether the hybrids are all first                        generation, or include some later generations.  Molecular                       fingerprinting techniques will be used that can distinguish between             these two possibilities.  The results from these combined field and             laboratory studies will provide important new information on the                means by which hybrids can give rise to allopolyploid species.",
