This project investigates a hypothesis related to the use of hand  tools, with particular emphasis on the application of any  discovered design principles to bilateral micromanipulators such as  those used in microsurgery, with the hope that these principles  would accelerate the evolutionary design and development of these  and other tools.  The hypothesis to be tested is that the hand tool  which optimizes performance of a given task is that which optimizes  the average power output from the operator, excepting power that is  dissipated in the tool.  Underlying this hypothesis is the notion  that a well-designed hand tool serves to effect an impedance match  between the human and the environment, enabling quick and efficient  energy transfer.  While this hypothesis does not deny the  importance of information processing, it avoids using a measure of  information transmission, which can be difficult to establish in  the unstructured tasks of typical tool use.  The study is performed  with a \"virtual tool system\" consisting of a real time  tool/environment simulation which outputs forces to a graphics  display.  A novel computer architecture for simulation is used to  achieve real time rates.",
