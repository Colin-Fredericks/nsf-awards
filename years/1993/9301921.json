 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award under the Small Grant for Exploratory Research                 program.  The immediate objective of the project is to isolate and              characterize genes encoding two enzymes (ATP sulfurylase and APS                kinase) that are involved in the first step in the sulfur                       assimilation pathway using Arabidopsis thaliana as an experimental              system.  The long-term objective is to understand the biology of                sulfur in higher plants.                                                                                                                                        Sulfur is an essential nutrient required by all organisms.  Plants              and microorganisms reduce inorganic sulfate to a variety of organic             compounds, and they provide animals with a source of organic                    sulfur.  Animals including humans require sulfur, yet do not have               the ability to convert inorganic sulfur to organic compounds.  The              role of sulfur is diverse, including an essential component of                  amino acids, some regulatory molecules and lipids.  In addition,                plants' ability to metabolize sulfur is potentially significant in              ameliorating sulfur toxicity in the environment.                                                                                                                Despite its obvious significance, very little is known about the                sulfur pathway in higher plants, or the mechanisms by which sulfur              mediates important cellular functions.  This research may help open             up a new field of research in biology.",
