 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of plant medicines by contemporary people of Hawaii                     is commonplace, even among urban populations and in a state                     which offers one of the most liberal access to biomedical                       health care in the US.  Especially for Native Hawaiians,                        health care professionals express concern that access to                        these alternative medicines delays seeking attention from                       practitioners of biomedicines, which compromises the                            efficacy of such therapy, and that plant medicines are used                     in conjunction with or to the exclusion of pharmaceuticals,                     thereby setting into motion physiochemical actions that                         might be contrary to the outcome of pharmaceutical therapy                      alone.                                                                                                                                                          The primary objective of this research is to investigate the                    use of plant medicines from a biobehavioral perspective that                    explores the cultural constructions of \"folk\" preventive and                    therapeutic strategies and links that to pharmacologic                          assessments of medicinal plants.  The principal concern is                      how preventive and therapeutic  strategies affect the                           physiological health of Native Hawaiians.  The plants                           isolated for attention will meet two criteria that increase                     the likelihood that they have a significant impact on                           health: 1) plants that enjoy wide currency - used most                          commonly by people and/or for more conditions; 2) plants                        most likely to compete directly with pharmaceuticals and                        other forms of biomedical care or to delay biomedical                           treatment.",
