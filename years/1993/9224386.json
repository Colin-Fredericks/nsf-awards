The   workshop will focus on academic-industry partnerships in   relation to training American engineers to produce goods and   services for the world marketplace, thereby enhancing American    global competitiveness.  The primary goal of the workshop is   to develop a collaborative program between universities and   industry in which German companies as well as American   companies with German subsidiaries accept American engineering    students for summer industrial-academic experiences in   Germany.  The program will involve chemical and mechanical   engineering students.  The workshop will be organized by the   German organization, DECHEMA, in cooperation with the National    Science Foundation and the DAAD (Deutscher Akademmischer   Austauschdienst).  Participants will include US and German   industry and academic representatives as well as government   and foundation representatives - all of whom will be selected   on the basis of interest and experience with such   international engineering programs.  Support is requested for   transportation costs and living expenses for workshop   participants.  Industry representatives will be encouraged to    cover all of their own expenses if possible.   ***",
