 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will examine the development of conceptual thought in             infants and young children and their ability to recall the past.                Until recently, we had little information about the way infants                 conceptualize the world or how long they can recall events that                 have happened to them.  The phenomenon known as infantile amnesia,              in which adults recall little or nothing about their early years,               suggests that infants may not be able to remember their past for                very long.  However, recent work in Mandler's laboratory indicates              that two-year-olds can recall events that occurred at age one. This             research program will use deferred imitation, in which children are             asked to imitate events they observed in the past, to measure                   recall in children too young to talk.                                                                                                                           There has also been little experimental work on concept formation               in infancy.  It has traditionally been thought that infants first               form concepts about concrete objects, such as dogs, chairs, and                 cars, and only later develop broader concepts of animals,                       furniture, and vehicles.  However, research from Mandler's                      laboratory indicates that the broader concepts precede the more                 specific ones.  This research will use several new techniques,                  involving the way that infants handle and explore objects, to test              this hypothesis.  The overall goal of the research is to provide a              systematic body of knowledge about the preverbal foundations of                 thinking and remembering, so that we can better understand what                 young children need to know in order to learn language.",
