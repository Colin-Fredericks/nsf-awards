 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306412  Dieci       Luca Dieci will work in the area  of computational  equations.  The PI and his collaborators will undertake several  projects, centered around the following two:  (1).  Numerical  Solution of Matrix Differential Equations;  (2).  Numerical  Approximation of Invariant Tori.       More in particular, Luca Dieci expects to continue working  on differential Riccati equations (DREs) and on applications  related to these equations.  Algorithmical and theoretical work  is specifically planned for the numerical solution of symmetric  DREs, a common occurrence in Engineering applications.  The main  effort here will be in studying stable indirect solution  strategies for the DREs, rather than direct discretizations.   Luca Dieci intends also to continue studying numerical questions  connected to the integration of matrix equations whose solution  is a unitary matrix.  He plans to devote time and resources to  the approximation of Lyapunov exponents, an issue which provided  the motivation for studying matrix equations with a unitary  solution.  Finally, he intends to continue the work on  approximation of invariant tori dynamical systems.  In  particular, he expects to extend and improve upon the previously  studied PdE approach.  Here, the main directions of research will  involve theoretical and practical study in order to complete the  approximation theory for the nonlinear case, and in order to free  the numerical procedures from the explicit knowledge of a  coordinate system in which to parametrize the tori.  The main  plan consists in using the continuous theory of Fenichel and in  making it into a numerical procedure, and in carefully studying  the associated implementation details.       The above projects have a strong computational component and  aim at developing reliable and rigorously justified algorithms  for important problems in computational ODEs.  ***",
