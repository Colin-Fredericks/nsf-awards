Modern materials                                   science requires that traditional disciplinary                                  boundaries be broached and that researchers from a                              range of core areas join together to focus on                                   modern material problems such as the design and                                 control of nanostructure, and novel processing and                              fabrication strategies.  Although Washington                                    University has an ongoing interdisciplinary                                     materials science effort, critical infrastructural                              deficiencies exist.                                                                  The present conditions in the materials                                    chemistry laboratories are hazardous and unsuitable                             for modern chemistry.  This award will provide                                  funding for the renovation of synthetic laboratory                              space that is used entirely for research and                                    research training activities.  Renovations will                                 include substantial hood space needed for the                                   conduction of synthetic procedures critical to                                  developing new experimental materials with novel                                and important properties.   A single network of                                 continuous ducting with vertical risers will                                    provide the laboratories with proper ventilation                                and a safe environment for studnets and staff.                                  Open modular work spaces will be provided to                                    promote interaction among colleagues.  Modern                                   interdisciplinary material research will become a                               strong and thriving enterprise with revitalized                                 facilities.",
