 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cell division cycle is the periodic repetition of certain                   events--DNA synthesis, mitosis, and cytokinesis--that transform a               single cell into two daughter cells.  Cell division must be                     coordinated to overall cell growth; otherwise, cells could become               arbitrarily large or vanishingly small.  By  observing how cells                respond to perturbations of the division cycle, cell biologists                 discovered that the DNA-to-protein ratio plays an essential role in             determining the timing of mitosis and cell division.  Recently,                 molecular studies have revealed four classes of proteins that                   participate prominently in the division control mechanism.  Two                 proteins, (cdc2 and cyclin) combine to form a heterodimer (\"mitosis             promoting factor,\" or MPF) that, when activated, triggers all the               major events of mitosis and cell division.  The activity of MPF is,             in turn, controlled by protein kinases and protein phosphatases                 that determine the phosphorylation state of MPF.  The long range                goal of this research is to develop mathematical models of the cell             division cycle in order to build secure, reliable connections                   between hard-won molecular details of the control mechanisms and                classical observations of the behavior of the intact regulatory                 system.  The model will describe the regulation of MPF activity by              phosphorylation, and how the phosphorylation state of MPF is                    determined by the DNA-to-protein ratio of the cell.  The                        mathematical approach is a tool to refine our assumptions and guide             our reasoning about the essential events of cell growth and                     division.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The goal of this research is to develop mathematical models of the              cell division cycle.  The mathematical modeling will be based on                recent experimental evidence concerning the biochemical control                 mechanisms involved in this fundamental life process.  The                      mathematical models will be useful in further refining  the                     interpretations of experimental data and as a guide in planning                 future experiments that ultimately should lead to a thorough                    understanding of how the cell division cycle is regulated.",
