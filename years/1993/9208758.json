 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for postdoctoral fellows                 at the National Institute of Statistical Sciences (NISS), to                    engage in cross-disciplinary research with significant                          statistical research components.  Jerome Sacks is Director of                   NISS, located in Research Triangle Park.  NISS is a recently                    formed institute whose inspiration came initially from an NSF                   sponsored workshop on cross-disciplinary research.  Subsequent                  meetings in the statistical community produced a site selection                 procedure and, ultimately, the Research Triangle site.  The                     creation of the Institute responded to the fact that in order to                address major national problems or \"Grand Challenges\",                          substantial progress has to be made in the methods and                          applications of statistical science.  A critical component of a                 continuing effort in this direction is the involvement and                      encouragement of junior researchers.                                                 The present project will support junior fellows to work on                 dedicated projects of high importance.  It will provide                         postdoctoral fellowship support for projects of a cross                         disciplinary nature.  The scope of the project is closest to the                role of the institutes in mathematics (IMA, MSRI, IAS).  However,               the outlook is quite different.  While the mathematics institutes               support postdoctoral fellows, their focus is on active                          collaboration with researcher from different disciplines, to                    solve important \"national problems\" which involve new statistical               research, in a manner fully consistent with recommendations of                  the Commission the Future of the NSF.
