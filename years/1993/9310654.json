 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio-frequency plasma discharges are used in the                               semiconductor industry for plasma deposition and plasma                         etching.  In a typical reactor, a radio-frequency (RF) voltage                  is applied between two parallel electrodes inside a vacuum                      chamber at 0.01 to 10 Torr.  The electric fields created                        accelerate electrons to very high energy levels.  These                         electrons collide with molecules to produce more electrons,                     ions, and highly reactive neutral radical species.  These                       chemical species then react with each other and solid surfaces                  according to the particular application.  Because the                           resultant composition of the gas phase will affect the rates                    and qualities of the etching or deposition, it is useful to                     sample the gas composition through a small orifice to a mass                    analyzer.                                                                                                                                                       Besides the role of neutral reactive species, the bombardment                   of the solid (wafer) surface by ions is also important.                         Because of the electrical interaction of electrons and ions in                  the plasma, a plasma \"sheath\" is formed near any solid                          surface.  This sheath contains an electric field that repels                    electrons and keeps them better contained within the center of                  the plasma.  The same electric field will accelerate positive                   ions towards the solid surface.  Therefore, the ions are                        directed to the surface with substantial energy (mean energies                  of a few eV to several hundred eV).  This directed, high-                       energy ion bombardment at solid surfaces produces directional                   etching in plasma etching applications, and it can alter film                   properties in plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD)                   of thin films.  Because of this important role of ions, the PI                  plans to sample this ion bombardment with subsequent analysis                   of the ion energy distribution and the composition of this ion                  stream.                                                                                                                                                         Mass spectrometry is a technique to determine the composition                   of either of these sampled neutral species or ions.  In the                     case of sampling uncharged molecules, these molecules first                     pass through an ionizing chamber where they are bombarded by                    electrons with sufficient energy to ionize a substantial                        fraction of the molecules.  For sampling the ions directly                      from the plasma, this step is not needed.  Once the ions are                    created or sampled, they pass through a mass filter                             (quadrupole) that allows ions with a narrow range of atomic                     mass to electrical charge ration (m/q) to pass through.  The                    flux of ions that pass through the filter at this m/q are then                  collected and measured with a Faraday cage or electron                          multiplier.  Thus by tuning through a range of m/q, the                         distribution of ions with particular m/q is measured.                                                                                                           This is a Research Equipment Grant (REG) to purchase a                          quadrupole mass spectrometer with ion monitoring capabilities                   which will be used to examine the neutral molecular species                     and ionic species from plasma discharges and a chemical vapor                   deposition reactor.",
