This research addresses two facets which are both important for success in this new research direction.  The first facet is concerned with automated intelligent generation of inspection plans.  This facet, which may be done off line, essentially constructs the inspection strategy.  The second facet deals with the lower level methods for effective execution of the generated inspection plan together with sensors and other resources.  In order to achieve the integrated intelligent inspection goals, the project addresses several interrelated problems.  These problems include: (i) developing hierarchical representation mechanisms to effectively capture the knowledge about geometric entities, their relationships, sensors, and plans (ii) reasoning mechanisms to determine the different attributes of the different features of object to be inspected, and the alternative strategies which can be used for inspection of each attribute, (iii) strategies for placement and viewing angles of cameras, and for determining the visible entities in each configuration, and (iv) optimization of the constructed plan.          An effective solution to this problem is clearly very important not only from the automation point of view, but also in order to effectively gather and use sensor information to overcome the volume and complexity of the needed data pro cessing for adequate performance.  The requested support will be used for investigations to achieve further results, and to develop a limited prototype system.  The ultimate goals are to demonstrate the developed limited prototype to industrial clients to stimulate their interest and involvement, and also to document the research results in professional publications.",
