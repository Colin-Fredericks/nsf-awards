 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dendrochronologists at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research,                    University of Arizona, have established a continuous bristlecone                pine tree-ring chronology from one locality in eastern California               that reaches from the present back to 6700 B.C.  Wood from the                  trees has been used to calibrate the radiocarbon time scale in                  calendrical years back to 6450 B.C.   An attempt will be made to                connect discontinuous segments of the tree-ring chronology that now             reach back to about 9500 B.C., or, through the entire Holocene into             Late Glacial times.  Samples dating earlier than 6450 B.C. will be              used for further radiocarbon calibration at the NSF-University of               Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility.  This is of                     considerable scientific interest because this data set is the only              one that might now, and for some time, provide truly annual                     resolution for independent verification of a similar radiocarbon                calibration based on European oak and pine.  The temporal overlap               between the oak and pine is not however based on tree-ring cross-               dating, but on matching patterns of radiocarbon activity near 8750              B.P.  Several bristlecone pine series now in hand are 14C dated to              the early Holocene.  One appears to have high potential for                     verifying the pattern of radiocarbon activity relied upon in the                European work.  This interdisciplinary work is important because it             permits new levels of accuracy in measurement of the rates of                   change in many global environmental processes.  The wood itself,                through other kinds of analyses, can provide new information on                 the nature and range of variation in climatic and other                         environmental parameters.",
