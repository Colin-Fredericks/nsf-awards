 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major objective of this research is to develop models for              the performance evaluation of manufacturing and communications                  networks.  The focus will be on modeling \"intelligent\" networks                 with dependent nodes, congestion-dependent routing, and concurrent              movements of units.  Such networks typically have routing of units              to avoid congestion, routing constraints due to physical capacities             or workload balancing, dynamically increasing or decreasing the                 processing rate at a node whenever downstream nodes are starved                 congested, parallel processing among several nodes, splitting and               merging of units, concurrent movement or batch processing of units,             and sharing of resources (tools, computer files) to do processing.                   The researchers intend to develop a large class of \"partially              balanced\" network processes that incorporate the dependencies,                  which cannot be handled by the existing theory of Jackson and                   quasi-reversible processes, as they deal only with independent                  nodes and routings.  The work involves characterizing the                       equilibrium behavior of partially balanced network processes and                developing subclasses of these processes with specific network                  topologies, node dependencies and flow controls that arise in                   manufacturing and communications.",
