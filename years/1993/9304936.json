Molecular genetic  and biochemical methods will be used to study proteins that control  transcription of homeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster.  The  homeotic genes determine the identities of segments in the fly.   Expression of the homeotic genes, in restricted positions along the  anterior-posterior axis, is needed throughout embryonic, larval and  pupal development.  Segmentation gene products activate the  homeotic genes in restricted positions in 2-hr old embryos, but  they decay by about 4 hrs.  The Polycomb group (PcG) products then  maintain restricted homeotic gene expression throughout subsequent  development.  The PcG products repress transcription of homeotic  genes in positions where they are not normally expressed.  Current  models suggest that the PcG products recognize homeotic genes that  are repressed initially and they maintain this repression by  assembling stable protein-DNA complexes in the chromatin at these  loci.  This research will investigate the individual roles of PcG  repressor proteins.  Much of the work will focus on the extra sex  combs (esc) protein, which may play a short-term role in assembling  or guiding other PcG proteins that act as stable repressors.  A  major objective of this work is to determine the biochemical roles  of esc protein.  This research will test if and how esc protein  interacts with other PcG proteins and when during development these  interactions occur.  Antibody to esc protein will be produced and  the times and places of esc protein accumulation will be determined  by protein blotting and whole mount staining of embryos.  Immune  precipitations will be performed to test for esc association with  other PcG proteins and to check for esc protein binding to DNA.   Site-specific mutagenesis, coupled with germline transformation,  will test a protein domain found in esc, and the yeast repressor  TUP1, fo r a role in protein-protein contact.  An \"interaction-trap\"  screen will be performed, using yeast cells, to identify fly  proteins that associate with esc protein.  Finally, a genetic  screen will be performed in flies to identify novel PcG genes.  The  screen will use P elements as transposon mutagens.  Transposon-  tagged PcG genes will be cloned by PCR methods and their molecular  analysis will be initiated.  Once a program of gene expression is  established in cells of a developing embryo or tissue, it is  important that inappropriate genes are stably repressed.   Repression of homeotic genes by PcG proteins provides a model for  how a determined state of gene expression is maintained during  development.  By investigating how PcG products work, we will learn  how developmental decisions, once made, are stabilized at the  molecular level.  Similar molecular mechanisms may be employed  during development in a variety of organisms.  Indeed, there are  similarities in sequence, organization and function between fly  homeotic genes and similar genes found in organisms as diverse as  worms and mice.  ***",
