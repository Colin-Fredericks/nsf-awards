Research will focus on the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR), which                 stabilizes vision by producing eye rotations that counterbalance                head rotations.  The VOR is mediated by vestibular nuclei neurons               (VNNs).  Recent neural network models suggest that the                          distributed encoding of eye-movement commands VNNs results                      because VNNs operate in parallel.  The underlying assumption is                 that parallelism is critical to VOR function.  The primary aim of               the project is to quantitatively test this assumption by studying               the effects on VOR of lesioning varying numbers of VNNs.                        Experimental subjects will be goldfish because they have a                      suitably well-developed VOR.                                                                                                                                    To generate predictions, varying numbers of VNNs will be removed                from a highly parallel and realistic model of the goldfish VOR.                 The initial prediction is that VNN lesions should degrade VOR                   function by increasing VOR harmonic distortion.  This will be                   tested experimentally by comparing VOR eye-movements before and                 after VNN lesions.  Data will be quantified using eye-velocity                  power spectra.  Lesion size will be quantified histologically.                  Results will be incorporated into larger and more realistic VOR                 neural network models, which will be implemented on massively                   parallel computers.             //",
