Soil nailing is an insitu soil reinforcement  technique that has been tested and implemented during the  past twenty years in a variety of civil engineering  applications.  The fundamental concept consists of placing  in the ground passive inclusions (steel reinforcing bars)  as the excavation proceeds, in order to restrain  displacements, limit decompression during and after the  excavation, and to form a nailed mass that can behave  similarly to a soft retaining wall.    Post-earthquake field investigations and laboratory studies  have shown that soil-nailed structures are highly resistant  to earthquake loading.  However, to date, only limited  studies have been conducted to evaluate their response and  possible failure mechanisms under seismic loading.  Such  research is needed to develop reliable design  methodologies. Given the increasing popularity of soil  nailing, this research project will have considerable  impact on the geotechnical design and construction  industries.    This project involves numerical analyses, laboratory  experiments -- in which a geotechnical centrifuge is used to  subject small-scale models to horizontal shaking -- and post  earthquake observations.  This integrated approach provides  a thorough understanding of the seismic response of soil  nailed systems, and will result in specific engineering  guidelines for their seismic design.    This is a collaborative project involving the University of  California at Los Angeles and the Polytechnic University,  New York, with the experiments being performed on the  geotechnical centrifuge at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.",
