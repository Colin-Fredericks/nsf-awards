 "awd_abstract_narration": "Silicon x-ray energy spectrometers have become very important tools             for elemental analysis in research and industry.  The deep                      sensitive depths required for Si x-ray detectors and some other Si              detectors and some other Si detector applications are usually                   obtained by a Li compensation technique commonly referred to as Li              Drifting.  Unfortunately, the Li compensation, Si(Li), is only                  quasi-stable at room temperature and very unstable at higher                    temperatures.  This temperature stability problem limits the                    performance and general usefulness of these detectors by                        prohibiting modern device processing technologies like oxide                    surface passivation and high temperature contact formation.  The                lack of oxide surface passivation to limit noise from surface                   leakage currents places severe restrictions on the maximum                      operating temperature of Li compensated detectors.  The lack of a               rugged oxide passivation and rugged diffused or implanted contacts              seriously restricts the operating ambient of Si(Li) devices.  We                outline here an alternative approach to compensation of Si which                should allow sensitive depths >3 mm, be compatible with high                    temperature oxide passivations, allow high temperature contact                  formation, and be much cheaper than Li drifting.  This new                      technology should result in cheaper x-ray detectors which will                  operate well at temperatures obtainable with thermoelectric or                  other simple cooling techniques rather than liquid nitrogen.  It                should also make it possible to build very large area, deep                     sensitive depth detectors at reasonable prices.",
