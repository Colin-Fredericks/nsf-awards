The students will have completed their sophomore                  college year and will be supported on their home campus by an on-               campus faculty sponsor.  The students will spend three to four                  weeks in the field and one to two weeks writing and illustrating                a final report covering their field research project.  The results              of their effort will be reported in poster session format at the                annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology and published in the                  Research Symposium Volume.  One research project for 1993-94 will               be located in Quetico Provincial Park, Ontario and will deal with               the Precambrian geology along a terrane boundary.  The second                   project will be in southern Vermont and covers the glacial and                  hydrologic aspects of the Vermont Valley.  The projects 1994-95                 will be located in Quetico Provincial Park and in the region of                 Clark Fork, Wyoming.",
