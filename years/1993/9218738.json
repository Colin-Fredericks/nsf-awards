 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI will conduct sedimentologic, stable isotopic and                        biostratigraphic studies of the Naples Beach exposure of the                    Miocene Monterey Formation, California.  Monterey Formation                     deposition occurred over a significant interval of global                       change, and the preservational quality of the Naples Beach                      section represents an important opportunity for obtaining                       detailed paleoenvironmental records.                                                 The sequestering of great quantities of organic carbon                     in the Monterey Formation and correlative deposits around                       the Pacific Rim has been linked to an early to middle                           Miocene increase in deep-sea  13C, and to global cooling                        through drawdown of pCO2, termed the \"Monterey Hypothesis\".                     The proposed work will test a corollary of the Monterey                         Hypothesis by evaluating the synchroneity between intervals                     of enhanced organic-rich deposition in the Monterey                             Formation and deep-sea  13C maxima, which requires better                       age control than the existing biostratigraphy and                               chemostratigraphy provide.  Stable isotopic stratigraphy has                    the potential for direct comparison of intervals of organic-                    rich deposition with  13C maxima in the Naples Beach record,                    or for correlation to deep-sea  13C maxima.  Central                            questions which the proposed work will address are:  Can                        stable isotopic stratigraphy enhance international                              correlation of the Monterey Formation and aid in testing the                    Monterey Hypothesis?  What is the relationship between                          sedimentary sequences in marginal basins of the Pacific Rim                     to global paleoceanographic changes?                                                 PI will develop a stable isotopic stratigraphy and a                       detailed paleoenvironmental history based on quantitative                       analysis of benthic foraminiferal faunas.  integration of                       the resulting faunal and stable isotopic time series with                       sedimentologic information will greatly enhance correlation                     to Miocene sequences of the Pacific Rim and illuminate the                      relationship between organic-rich deposition and global                         oceanographic events in the early to middle Miocene.",
