 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306919  Baldwin  Stress is a subject of interest shrouded in ambiguity.  Confusion  reigns concerning the concept of stress in general and the effect  of such a phenomenon on the neuroimmunological system in  particular.  The ambiguity may be attributed, in part, to the  limited number of parametric studies which actually test stress  models.  Furthermore, there is evidence to indicate that the  specific characteristics of the stressful event (e.g., type of  stressor, duration of stressor, predictability of the stressor) can  produce immunosuppression or immunoenhancement.  The overall aim of  this Research Planning Grant is to examine one aspect of the  stressful event, stressor type (physical vs psychological), on a  panel of immunological and neuroendocrine parameteres.  The  physical stressor being examined in this study is voluntary  running, and the psychological stressor will be immobilization.   The experiments address the following questions: 1) What are the  similarities and differences between physical and psychological  stress events on immunocompetence?  What are the plausible  biochemical pathways through which stress-induced immunomodulation  occurs?  2) What is the relationship between onset of changes in  neuroendocrine markers (catecholamine, corticosteroid, glucose) and  immunity?  Will the effect differ with respect to stressor type and  gender?     Both physical and psychological stress have been shown to produce  immune effects.  Stressful events may differ with regard to  specific physiological outcomes, while sharing the same underlying  physiological mechanism.  The overall expected results are as  follows:  1) psychological stress alone (immobilization) will  produce the greatest compromise of immune functioning compared to  the physical stress of voluntary running, and 2) immunosuppression  will be associated with a heightened neuroendocrine response to  stress.   ***",
