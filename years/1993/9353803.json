Cranbrook Institute of Science, a science museum north of Detroit, will be the catalyst for this  effort which will bring together more than 75 professionals and associations already recognized  for their focus on science issues.  The museum will initiate this collaborative effort which is  expected to reach more than 800 girls with sustained science programming.    Four specific tasks will be included in the year-long effort: 1) Science Programs for Girls  consisting of direct hands-on science activities, 2) Parent Support Activities comprised of family  centered events, including seminars and a newsletter, 3) a conference for leaders of organizations  interested in science for girls and 4) a Network for science program leaders and teachers.  The  result of this effort is expected to be a dedicated corps of adult leaders and parents who can  knowledgeably encourage girls in science, and more than 800 girls whose positive experiences  and new contacts will sustain their interests in science.  ***",
