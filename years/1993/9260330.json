 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of electrochemistry.  The goal of this research effort is              to establish the feasibility of using electrochemical impedance                 pattern recognition for the detection of microbially influenced                 corrosion (MIC) occurring at metal surfaces.  The approach is                   directed towards development of pattern recognition schemes based               upon the on-line acquisition of electrochemical impedance spectra               using fast Fourier transform electrochemical impedance                          spectroscopy (FFTEIS) instrumentation at the suspect corrosion                  site.  This will be followed by treatment of the electrochemical                impedance spectral data using the principal components analysis                 (PCA) technique.  The resulting PCA transformed data will then be               subjected to analysis by software based pattern recognition                     techniques to classify the MIC corrosion site.  Because all                     aspects of the proposed approach can be handled by portable                     computer driven hardware and software, the ultimate goal of the                 planned multi-Phase SBIR activity is the development of portable                diagnostic instrumentation for the on-line determination of MIC.                %%%                                                                             This Phase I project brings together disparate technologies of                  electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the fast Fourier                      transform implementation, principal components analysis, and                    pattern recognition for the purpose of identifying microbially                  induced corrosion in contrast with abiotic corrosion.  The proof                of concept plan set forth for Phase I should determine the                      feasibility of this approach to diagnosing problems of enormous                 economic importance.",
