A  series of nine experiments will attempt to determine whether  spatial memories are \"orientation specific\" or \"orientation free.\"   In orientation-specific representations, locations are specified in  view-specific reference frames and the representation has a  canonical orientation.  One's memory of a map or of the globe is an  example of an orientation-specific representation because it is  oriented with north at the top.  Orientation-free representations,  on the other hand, are not view dependent and do not have a  canonical orientation.  An example of such a representation is  memory of the interior of one's home; such memories typically do  not have a canonical orientation.  An obvious difference between  these types of memories is the number of perspectives we had on the  spatial layout when it was learned (typically only one for a map,  but several for natural environments).  The experiments will test  this explanation and other explanations of the differences between  memories of small- and large-scale spaces.  Another series of four  experiments will investigate the causes of asymmetries in distance  estimations.  Previous research has shown that when people estimate  distances from memory, estimates from salient landmarks to less  salient locations (e.g., from the Washington Monument to the  Pension Building) are larger than estimates from the less salient  building to the landmark.  The goal of the proposed experiments is  to determine why these asymmetries occur.  These studies of spatial  memory will provide crucial new knowledge about the basic  mechanisms that underlie our ability to recognize scenes and to  navigate in familiar and unfamiliar environments.  This knowledge  will shed light on the causes of individual differences in spatial  ability, and will aid in the development of freely moving robotic  systems.    The second  line of experiments will investigate the causes of  associative priming.  When people retrieve information from memory,  performance is often affected by previous retrieval operations or  by the context in which the retrieval takes place.  In the lexical  decision task, for example, one must decide whether a string of  letters is a word or a nonword (e.g., blit).  It has been widely  documented that lexical decisions on a word are faster and more  accurate when the word is preceded by an associated word (e.g.,  hospital-doctor) than when the word is preceded by an unassociated  word (e.g., library-doctor).  This facilitation is called  \"priming,\" and it occurs in nearly all tasks that require memory  retrieval.  The goal of this line of research is to test various  theories of associative priming.  The ubiquity of priming indicates  that it is caused by a fundamental mechanism of memory retrieval.   Thus, an understanding of the causes of priming will provide  important new insights into basic properties of human memory.    ***",
