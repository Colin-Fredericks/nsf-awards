 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design, analysis, and implementation of highly                         concurrent synchronization mechanisms shall be investigated.  In                the traditional approach to synchronization, conflicting                        operations are implemented as mutually exclusive \"critical                      sections\".  This has the effect of serializing operations, much                 to the detriment of performance.  Such implementations also                     suffer from a lack of resiliency, as they are not immune to                     halting failures.  Highly concurrent synchronization mechanisms                 minimize these shortcomings by either eliminating or reducing the               need for critical sections.  The research is divided into three                 principal components.  The first component involves the                         development of highly concurrent synchronization mechanism and                  the development of tools for automatically incorporating such                   mechanisms in concurrent and distributed programs.  The second                  component is concerned with the analysis of synchronization                     mechanisms by means of discrete-event simulation.  The third and                final component is concerned with implementation, specifically                  the synchronization mechanisms on a variety of real-world                       computing applications.  The tools and algorithms developed will                be of use to system designers and application programmers alike,                providing a sound basis for the development of high-performance,                fault-tolerant distributed computing applications.",
