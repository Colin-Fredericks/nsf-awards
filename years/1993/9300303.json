In addition, NCSU has a specific goal of attracting at                least six women and minorities for this program.  Applicants will               be selected on a competitive basis in a nationwide search with                  particular emphasis being given to those students in the SUCCEED                Coalition and HBCUs including Hampton, Howard, Morgan State,                    Prairie View A&M, Southern, Tennessee State, and Tuskegee.                      Additional applicants from NCSU's Engineering Scholars Program will             be sought to participate in the REU site program.  The objective                of the program is to motivate students to pursue graduate study by              sharing with them the excitement, rewards, and work involved in a               research experience.",
