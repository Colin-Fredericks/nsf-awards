Variables such as completion or noncompletion of the PhD and             time taken to completion will be related to factors such as                     individual and demographic characteristics, academic background,                field of science, and market characteristics for PhD hiring in and              outside of academia.  The effects of receiving and not receiving a              GFP award per se will be estimated.  The analysis of this highly                select group -- those applying to the GFP -- will bring previous                work by other investigators by tracing PhD completion up to the                 mid- to late 1980s.",
