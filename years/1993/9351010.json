The exercise is  enabling students in undergraduate mineralology/geochemistry  courses to directly measure reaction rates at various  temperatures while simultaneously allowing them to observe the  evolution of grain-surface morphology during the reaction.   This is greatly improving student understanding of several  basic principles of chemical kinetics directly relevant to the  geological sciences, including diffusion, the temperature  dependance of reaction rates, and the relationship between  rate-limiting mechanisms and crystal-surface morphology.  The  lab exercise is generating dynamic (real-time) geochemical rate  data which students then are using to augment traditional  quantitative homework exercises. Furthermore, the equipment is  being used to calibrate a technologically much less complicated  version of the exercise.  Any geology department with  microscopes, hot plates, beakers, thermometers, and stopwatches  can perform the same exercise without the necessity of massive  investments in dedicated equipment.  ***y",
