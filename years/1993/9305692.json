 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305692  Berger       This award provides 60% of the cost of improving the  laboratory equipment in the thermoluminescence (TL) dating  laboratory in the Department of Geology at the Western Washington  University. The University is committed to providing the remaining  funds needed for the equipment upgrade.       Thermal luminescence chronology uses the fact that mineral  grains act as dosimeters of natural radiation capable of storing  a portion of the energy from low-level environmental ionizing  radiation (alpha, beta, gamma rays) which they absorb while at or  near the surface. Because daylight empties light-sensitive electron  traps and heating empties all electron traps (i.e., thermally  stable defect sites) the time of last exposure to daylight of  unheated samples or the last heating of volcanically heated  materials can be dated with TL methods. At earth surface  temperatures the storage of radiation energy can be accommodated  for up to about one million years, making the TL method especially  useful for timing events in the Quaternary period. The improved  capabilities of the Western Washington University lab will be used  in research projects which require dating of Quaternary samples.  ***",
