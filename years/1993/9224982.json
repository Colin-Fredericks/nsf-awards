The training model features                            apprenticeship, hands-on teaching for a ten week period where                   students learn by actively participating in all phases of a                     research study including:  problem formulation, data collection and             analysis, presentation at a professional meeting, manuscript                    preparation, and publication.  Eight students, recruited                        nationally, will work with one of 19 faculty associates, whose                  interests collectively address biological, psychological, and                   sociocultural aspects of behavior.  Research projects represent the             full spectrum of scholarship in psychology, from neuroanatomy to                literary analysis, from work with animals to studies of peoples in              foreign cultures.                                                                                                                                               This award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to                attract talented students into careers in science through active                undergraduate research experiences.",
