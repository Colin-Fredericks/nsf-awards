The aim of the  course is to enable students to make more precise measurements,  advance beyond the fundamentals and become familiar with the  latest equipment. The project is part of the planned  development of an optics center at the university.  One central  piece of equipment is a programmable VIS/UV spectrophotometer.   This allows students to measure accurately the oscillator  strength of rhodamine 6G in water for the experiment dealing  with the classical dispersion theory, the absorption spectrum  of CdS in an experiment dealing with band-gap energy, and the  absorption spectrum of leaded glass in an experiment concerning  Faraday rotation.  The light scattering experiment will be  improved with an argon-ion laser and a photon counter system.   Students can measure the intensity of light at different lasing  wavelengths, as well as different scattering angles.  With a  dye laser pumped with a nitrogen laser, students measure the  response time of CdS photodetectors.  It is important that  students have a concept of response time of a detector. For  optical filtering experiments, students use a new optical  imaging system consisting of a CCD camera, a frame grabber and  a personal computer to record the filtered images and analyze  them precisely.  For an electrooptics experiment, students  control the function of a Pockels cell and analyze the state of  light passing through the cell with a computer.  Finally a new  experiment illustrates the powerful technique of optical  modulation and demodulation using a photoelastic modulator and  a phase-sensitive detector.  ***",
