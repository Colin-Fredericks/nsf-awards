An amphibian species, Agalychnis callidryas lay its eggs on plants overhanging ponds, and the tadpoles fall into the water when they hatch.  Tadpoles are able to hatch as early as 5 days old and will do so to escape from egg-eating snakes, if they are attacked.  Undisturbed tadpoles, however, usually delay hatching for several days.  They continue growing, inside the egg, and then they hatch they are less vulnerable to aquatic predators than are the smaller, early-hatching tadpoles.  The proposed research examines the effect on survival of developmental and behavioral flexibility in hatching, in the context of risks facing embryos and tadpoles.  %%%  Many animals live in different environments at different stages in their lives, and most animals hatch.  The problems facing animals making such changes are general, but in many systems only one of the two stages is accessible to study under natural conditions.  This study of the effects of changes in hatching time on both the eggs and larvae of the red-eyed treefrog will add to our understanding of behavior and ecology.  It will also provide detailed information on the ecology of this high profile rainforest species,  particularly its interactions with its predators at a crucial life stage.  ***    Small Format Large Format Large Capacity   Cassette                 Env Manual Feed   Letter Quality Near Letter Quality Memo Draft 9311196  Ryan    This project will investigate why animals hatch when they hatch, and how the timing of hatchi ng affects their s        5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 F                             |             |                                 (    Times New Roman    Symbol  & Arial       z   z         z           \"             h     gz Egz E              t         N    Abstracts Tree-frogs   Elizabeth M.
