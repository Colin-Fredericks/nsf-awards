 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steroid and peptide hormones have a major impact on the behavior                of mammals.  While it is believed that many of the behavioral                   effects of hormones result from their action on the central                     nervous system, how hormones change brain function to influence                 behavior is not well understand.  Dr. Albers, who has previously                received support from the National Science Foundation, will                     continue his work on steroid-peptide-transmitter interactions, a                general problem of substantial interest in neurobiology.                        Sophisticated anatomical and biochemical techniques are used to                 examine a sexually dimorphic communicative behavior which has                   proven to be an excellent model system.  Specifically, Dr. Albers               will focus on three different brain sites where it is believed                  that vasopressin, a neuropeptide, interacts with the gonadal                    steroid hormones testosterone and estradiol to regulate                         communicative behavior.  He will determine whether the gonadal                  steroids influence the behavior by changing the amount of                       vasopressin that can be released at these brain sites or by                     changing its sensitivity at a particular brain site.  Moreover,                 Dr. Albers will explore the interconnections of the three brain                 regions implicated in the control of this behavior and thus,                    provide new information about their neural circuitry.  He will                  also investigate whether social factors that influence the                      expression of this communicative behavior do so by altering the                 activity of vasopressin in the brain.   Finally, a carefully                    designed set of pharmacological studies will be carried out to                  determine how the noradrenergic transmitter system is involved in               coordinating the expression of this communicative and other                     behaviors.  The results from these studies will make an important               contribution to our understanding of the basic mechanisms                       underlying the relationship between the nervous and endocrine                   systems in the regulation of behavior.",
