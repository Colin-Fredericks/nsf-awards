The processing of large collections of heterogeneous text is  addressed where both the text lengths and the subject matter vary  widely.   In such circumstances, the integrity of full documents  cannot be maintained, but access needs to be provided to individual  text excerpts in accordance with specific user requirements.   This  project is concerned with three main aspects relating to the design  and operations of a flexible full-text environment: the content  analysis and text indexing for heterogeneous data in unrestricted  subject areas; the generation of linked text structures of many  kinds where similar text excerpts are jointly accessible by  following the text links; and the implementation of sophisticated  text utilization methods in such a structured text environment.    Corpus-based text analysis methods are under development based on  sophisticated text matching algorithms that account both for  existing global vocabulary coincidences between different texts,  and for similarities in the local environment in which the  vocabulary is used.   When similar words are used in similar local  contexts, the meanings are normally congruent.   Hypertext  structures of relatable text excerpts must then be generated at  various levels of detail, and these linked text structures must be  utilized for flexible text traversal, and the recognition of text  themes, and the automatic construction of text abstracts and  summaries.   The availability of large structured text environments  will vastly improve the manipulation of collections of full text,  and open up many areas of application in text transformation and  text use.     ***",
