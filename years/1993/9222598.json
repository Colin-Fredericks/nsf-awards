 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general goals of this project are to understand individual                  recognition by scent in animals and, eventually, to use this as a               way to understand the functional organization of the olfactory                  system in the brain as well as aspects of social memory.  In this               project, Dr. Johnston will investigate how animals communicate by               scent.  In particular, he will study a phenomenon known as scent                over-marking, in which one animal deposits its scent in the same                places as another.  Preliminary results suggest that, by doing                  so, one animal can mask the information in scent deposited                      previously by another individual, suggesting that over-marking                  has competitive functions.  Using golden hamsters in a variety of               behavioral tests, Dr. Johnston will attempt to (1) document such                competitive functions of over-marking in the social lives of                    animals, (2) characterize the special perceptual mechanisms that                allow animals to decipher information from places that have been                marked by several individuals, and (3) investigate how animals                  use information about individuals in such marks to guide their                  social behavior.                                                                                                                                                These experiments have importance for at least three domains of                 science, and may have some practical implications as well.                      First, olfactory communication and scent-marking are important in               the lives of most mammals, a few birds, most reptiles, some                     amphibians, and a huge number of invertebrates, yet we still                    understand little about it.  This research promises entirely new                insights into how animals use scent to communicate with one                     another and thus to regulate their social interactions.  This new               knowledge would help us to understand such aspects of behavior as               territoriality, dominant-subordinate interactions, mate choice                  and competition for mates, and social recognition.  Thus, it                    could eventually have practical implications for how to better                  house animals in captivity in labs and zoos, or to manage their                 behavior in households, and could even be helpful in wildlife                   management.  Second, these experiments should give us new                       insights into the sense of smell by characterizing heretofore                   unsuspected sensory-perceptual abilities by which animals can                   extract information about one individual from complex mixtures of               scent from two or more individuals.  Third, the experiments will                provide new knowledge and new behavioral paradigms that can be                  used as models for investigating the brain mechanisms underlying                both the sense of smell and more general processes such as                      individual recognition and memory.",
