 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study of the heat and volume transport from the Arctic Ocean               through the Canadian Archipelago to Baffin Bay and the North                    Atlantic Ocean will be based at Resolute, NWT, Canada, and will                 examine the diapycnal exchange of energy, salt, and momentum among              the various regional water masses.  The observational phase will                include measurements of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic               energy, of the vertical temperature and salinity microstructure,                and of the high resolution current structure.                                                                                                                   Barrow Strait is bathymetrically complex, consisting of several                 interconnecting narrow deep passages, partially isolated by                     relatively shallow sills.  It is however the pathway for a                      significant fraction of the outflow from the Arctic Ocean.                                                                                                      This work will be the first detailed investigation of the principal             mechanisms responsible for the vertical diffusion of heat, salt,                and momentum in this region.  These not only affect the seasonal                growth and melting of sea ice, but also modify the advective                    exchange rates by affecting the upwelling of deep warm water which              is otherwise blocked by the shallow sills in the strait.",
