 "awd_abstract_narration": "Materials are being developed for an innovative course in                       mathematical applications as a modern replacement for existing                  precalculus and related courses.  The course is an introduction                 to mathematical models at the precalculus level and provides                    students with the skills and knowledge needed for calculus.                     The models developed in the course are primarily based on                       discrete mathematical topics such as difference equations, data                 analysis, probability, and matrix algebra.  The course involves                 computer and/or graphing calculator work to investigate most of                 the mathematical models.  It also involves a variety of live                    classroom experiments to investigate how well the mathematical                  models reflect actual processes or to help develop mathematical                 models based on observed experimental data.  The course                         features a series of student investigations to provide a real-                  life dimension.  It is designed to provide students with the                    motivation and impetus to continue on in mathematically related                 fields by exposing them to the wide applicability of                            mathematics.",
