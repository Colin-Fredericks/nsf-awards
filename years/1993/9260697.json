 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freshwater aquaculture systems have requirements for improved                   instrumentation to monitor water quality.  Closed loop control of               water quality will provide additional advantages to this growing                worldwide industry.  The objective of the proposed program is to                develop systems to monitor and control water quality in                         freshwater aquaculture.  These systems will be based on the use                 of novel fiber optic chemical sensors or optrodes.  This type of                sensor is especially well suited to the requirements of                         continuous in-situ monitoring of aqueous solutions.  The systems                that will be developed under this program promise to increase                   aquaculture growth rates, productivity and efficiencies in                      environmentally safe facilities.                                                                                                                                In the Phase I program, the requirements for chemical sensors in                freshwater aquaculture will be assessed.  An ammonia optrode will               be designed, fabricated, and calibrated in the laboratory.  This                sensor will then be evaluated in a recirculating aquasystem.                    Concepts for chemical sensors to detect other chemical species or               water parameters identified in the requirements assessments will                be developed.  Additionally, a concept for a system that will                   both monitor and control water quality in freshwater aquaculture                systems will be developed.",
