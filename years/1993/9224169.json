 "awd_abstract_narration": "Few events are as traumatic, in both personal and corporate terms,              as layoffs.  This project explores how workers view the causes of               their job loss and how they decide whether they have suffered                   wrongful or discriminatory treatment.  The project expands the                  study of decisions about suing by looking at claiming decisions                 with respect to past employers.  The study will test a number of                theories of litigation behavior, focusing particularly on how                   feelings of fair or unfair treatment by the former employer affects             the decision to make a wrongful termination claim.  By helping us               to understand the psychological and social processes involved in                claiming decisions, the study will contribute to our understanding              of how everyday notions of fair treatment affect the movement of                cases into the legal system.                                                                                                                                    This collaborative study will include interviews of 1075 recently               fired or laid-off workers recruited at state unemployment offices.              The interviews will explore a variety of factors thought to                     contribute to the decision to sue, including pre-termination                    treatment, financial burdens of unemployment, awareness of claiming             options, and feelings of discrimination.  Follow-up interviews with             some of the workers will be used to determine who actually                      initiated wrongful termination claims.",
