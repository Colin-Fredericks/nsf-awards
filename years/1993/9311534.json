A  direct connection to SURAnet will provide researchers, faculty,  staff and students at VTC member institutions with improved  access to national and international networks such as NSFNET,  ESnet, NSI, and a whole host of other information resources  available via the Internet.       For some VTC member institutions, particularly the community  colleges, this connection represents the only method of accessing  the Internet.  By linking VTC LINK to SURAnet, the VTC and WHRO-  TV propose to set an example for other higher education consortia  of individual community colleges interested in working with their  local public television stations to establish similar  connections.       The connection, once in place, will greatly facilitate  collaborative research efforts involving community colleges, four  year institutions of their education and research organizations  such as CEBAF (the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility)  and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.       In addition to VTC LINK, WHRO-TV operates two other  telecomputing systems, VA.PEN and Learning Link, serving the  kindergarten through 12th grade educational community.  A side  benefit of the SURAnet connection will be the inclusion of K-12  teacher and student, when appropriate, in the above mentioned  projects.  ***                                                  NSFNET",
