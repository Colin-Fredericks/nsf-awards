The ideal proposal provided not only the opportunity to  achieve significant progress on (1) a fundamental problem in science or  engineering whose solution could be advanced by applying high performance  computing techniques and resources, (2) enabling technologies which facilitate  those advances, but also significant interactions between scientific and  computational activities, usually involving mathematical, computer or  computational scientist, that would have impact in high performance computational  activities beyond the specific scientific or engineering problem areas(s) or  discipline being studied.  This multi-disciplinary project will investigate and  develop strategies for efficient implementation of I/O intensive applications in  computational science and engineering.  Scalable parallel I/O approaches will be  pursued by a team of computer scientist and applications scientists who will work  together to:          * Characterize the I/O behavior of specific application programs running          on large massively parallel computers        * Abstract and define I/O models (templates)        * Implement and test application-level I/O tools on large-scale          computations                The Pablo performance analysis environment will provide the foundation for  the performance instrumentation and analysis.  The application programs are  already fully operational on advanced architecture systems and their authors are  all co-investigators in this project.  The principal computers used will be the  Intel Touchstone Delta and Paragon systems at Caltech, each with over 500  computational nodes.  Five application areas will be included:  fluid dynamics,  chemistry, astronomy, neuroscience, and modelling of m aterials-processing  plasmas.  The parallel programs for these applications cover a range of I/O  patterns and volume, and the techniques that will be developed in this project  will be of relevance to a broad spectrum of engineering and science applications.   In addition, by overcoming their current I/O limitations, the specific  applications targeted in this award will achieve significant new science and  engineering results.  By the end of the project, sustained teraFlops computers  will become available.  The project will devise and implement general methods for  scalable I/O using today's advanced computers, immediately apply those methods  to carry out unprecedented applications in several fields, and use the methods  and experience gained in the first half of the project to tackle the I/O issues  in future sustained teraFlops computers.  This project will be carried out by a  team of researchers who have many years of experience in using parallel computers  for large-scale applications, in measuring and characterizing the behavior of  applications on such computers, and in creating methods and tools that facilitate  the use of such systems.  Building on this considerable experience, the project  will concentrate initially on exploring the I/O behavior of existing applications  and on devising ways to get adequate and scalable I/O performance.  The five  application areas included in this award cover a wide range of I/O needs and  behavior, including the use of out-of-core methods, reading data from high-speed  instruments, interactive and irregular data flows in modelling, and pipelining  of data from distributed computing resources on high-speed networks.  A key part  of the approach is an integration effort that will concentrate on ensuring close  communication and synergy among the components of the project and on integrating  the results.  The primary objective of the project is to develop methods and  insights that are as generally applicable as possible.  This award is being  suppo rted by the Advanced Projects Research Agency as well as NSF programs in  engineering and computer science.",
