Specific equipment is used for field and  laboratory exercises focusing on Texas coastal barrier island  environments and the organisms that inhabit them. Field  exercises include profiles of coastal waters and lagoons,  analysis of bottom sediments and organisms, and studies of  benthic communities. Laboratory studies also physiological  adaptations and behavioral interactions of cold- water  organisms, and marine plants and invertebrate animals collected  in the field. It is expected that an increased appreciation of  the marine environment will result from these studies.  Moreover, the project will provide meaningful field and  laboratory experiences in marine biology for undergraduate  students.  ***",
