This is being accomplished by incorporating a series of new  investigations using contemporary computer technology into the  curriculum.  Microcomputers are used to perform data collection  and graphing in the areas of force, motion, temperature, and  radiation. The microcomputers are used to provide immediate  feedback for student analysis of data, which stimulates them to  experiment on their own with a larger number and variety of  trials, to discover relations in the physical world.  Six  networked Microcomputer Based Labs (MBLs) have been obtained,  all of which are equipped with a Universal Lab Interface (ULl),  appropriate sensors and software.  A master MBL station  equipped with a high resolution Monitor, SuperDrive, modem and  power source has also been obtained. This equipment is  revitalizing the physics and Integrated Technologies programs  at CCC, and is providing the necessary technology to further  the college's stated mission to prepare physics students to  meet the challenges of science in the next century.  This  project is encouraging students to continue to study and  support science by improving their experiences with physics.  ***y",
