 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304092  Weiss  The soxRS (superoxide response) regulon of Escherichia coli an  adaptation to oxidative stress.  It includes the genes for a  superoxide dismutase, endonuclease IV (a DNA repair enzyme), and  glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase.  Induction occurs in two stages.   SoxR is first altered by an oxidative signal to become a  transcriptional activator of SoxS.  The overexpressed SoxS then  activates the target genes of the regulon.  The first question to  be answered is whether or not the two-stage mechanism provides a  temporally programmed response; i.e., are there genes other than  soxS that are turned on directly by the activated SoxR and that are  therefore expressed before those genes targeted by SoxS? To answer  this question, 2-D gel protein patterns are being examined in  regulon-constitutive (soxR) mutants that have a soxS deletion.  The  major part of this research deals with purification of SoxS and  SoxR proteins from overproducing strains and a study of their  interactions with their DNA binding sites and with RNA polymerase.   Because the Sox S protein is a member of the large AraC family, so  many analogs of which are being separately studied, investigations  is limited to examining only its unique properties; thus, its  specific recognition sequence will be delineated via DNA  footprinting and mutational analysis of the for promoter region.  SoxR, which is activated directly and/or indirectly by superoxide,  will be studied more extensively.  An attempt will be made to  reconstruct SoxR-mediated soxS induction in vitro an to use it to  identify the possible effector (s).  The physical traits of the  native SoxR protein will be compared with both mutationally  activated and chemically activated forms to provide an insight into  the mechanism of induction.  The physical traits to be examined  will include evidence of phosphorylation or proteolysis and changes  in metal content, DNA footprint, titratable thiols, absorption  spectrum, fluorescence, and multimer formation.    %%%  Because bacterial regulons are controlled in diverse ways, they  provide many useful models for the coordinate regulation of  dispersed genes in all organisms.  Ultimate goals of the studies on  the soxRS regulon are (a) the understanding of an additional system  of multigene regulation and (b) the elaboration of the mechanism  whereby organisms that grow in the presence of oxygen can deal with  toxic by products of oxidative growth.  ***",
