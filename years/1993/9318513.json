 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318513  Moccia  The National League for Nursing (NLN) is in the process of  establishing an electronic communication network which will 1)  support active exchange among its national membership of nurses,,  educators, researchers, students, and consumers and other members  of the nursing community and 2) allow these same groups to access  a nation-wide database.  The connection of choice is Internet.   This proposed project will provide the start-up fees for the  network.  The National League for Nursing is the repository of data on over  1500 graduate and undergraduate educational programs throughout the  United States.  This data includes information on curriculum,  facilities and health care issues.  Information is also available  on practitioners, practice settings and research projects.  The League currently disseminates the information through meetings,  publications, printed reports and computer disks.  The Internet  connection would allow for electronic on-line access to and  exchange of information within the nursing community.  The dynamic  exchange of data would promote collegial discussion on education,  research and health care issues, thus expanding and enriching the  information for the users.",
