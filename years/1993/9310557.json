 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310557  LEICHT  One of the most important developments in the workplace over the  past twenty years has been the movement of large numbers of women  into professional work.  This has occurred in a context of growing  dissatisfaction with differences in professional opportunities  available to men and women in bureaucratic organizations.  In spite  of the public recognition this problem has received, there has been  little systematic study of careers among male and female  professionals and little understanding of when and how the careers  of male and female professionals diverge.  This project will  provide answers to fundamental questions regarding gender  stratification among professionals, such as the processes that lead  male and female professionals to change jobs and the labor market  forces that lead them to accept positions in corporations with  different characteristics.  This information will be of vital  importance for understanding workplace discrimination in a context  of expanding opportunities for women in the professions.    The study examines the growth and divergence of opportunities for  professional men and women by studying career development within  corporate legal departments in large U.S. corporations.  The  project will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase will  attempt to determine what characteristics of corporations and legal  departments lead to high concentrations of women within certain  departments and job titles.  The second phase of the project will  look at factors affecting job changes among individual department  members, focusing on the effects of early career events on the  movements of male and female professionals.  The data for this  project will be taken from successive waves of the Law and Business  Directory of Corporate Counsel (1980-1992) and be supplemented with  corporation level information provided by other published sources.  ***",
