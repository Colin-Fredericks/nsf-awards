The issue of abortion will be used to develop and  test a broader theory of public discourse and the conditions under  which social movements are likely to influence it.  The abortion  issue provides significant variation between countries and over  time on two major variables of interest: (a) the degree of  polarization reflected in mass media discourse and (b) the relative  influence of social movement actors compared to political parties  and other institutional actors in shaping it.  The primary methods  employed are content analysis of newspapers and other mass media  sources over time and a combination of content analysis and  informant interviews with spokespersons who have promoted a  particular interpretation or way of framing the abortion issue.   The research design will employ common research instruments and  cross-national teams in data collection.    This project will contribute significantly to scientific  understanding of how the mass media and social movements interact  to shape public perceptions of major social issues.  Because it  focuses on an important controversy that has developed quite  differently in Germany and the United States, it will contribute to  knowledge about the differences between these societies and provide  insights that will be valuable to policy-makers confronting future  disputes.    ***",
