 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Pearson is comparing the relative status of African-                  American and White doctoral chemists in the American scientific                 community.  Previous studies of the career patterns of American                 chemists have not included racial status.  This research seeks to               contribute to this literature by examining the participation of                 African-Americans in chemistry.                                                                                                                                 Professor Pearson is examining the career patterns of all African-              Americans known to have earned chemistry doctorates.  He and his                student assistants are collecting data by means of a mailed                     questionnaire and personal interviews.  The control group is                    comprised of White chemists matched on four criteria:  (1)  Ph.D.-              granting department, (2) sex, (3) thesis advisor (where possible),              and (4) research specialty.                                                                                                                                     Professor Pearson is analyzing the data by means of bivariate and               multivariate statistics.  Because much of the existing knowledge of             the role of race in science in general and chemistry in particular              is unsystematic and anecdotal, the results of the study will                    advance our knowledge of the career patterns of African-American                doctoral scientists.  The results should provide data that permit               scholars to revise our understanding the experiences of African-                American chemists vis-a-vis their white counterparts.  While this               history cannot correct past wrongs, it can point the way to                     avoiding those mistakes in the future.  And to the extent that                  recent policy has ameliorated past wrongs, the study should help to             assess what works and does not work in the effort to create true                equal opportunity within science.",
