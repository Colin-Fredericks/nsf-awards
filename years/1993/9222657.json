 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although plasticity of the nervous systems has been viewed as the               property of the development central nervous system, increasing                  evidence indicate that the adult brain has great potential for                  modulation of functional organization and at least part of this                 reflects hormonal effects.  The hypothalamo-neurohypophysial                    system has proved to be a useful model to study environmentally                 induced neural plasticity.  Under conditions of increased                       physiological demand such as lactation, parturition and                         dehydration, neurosecretory cells in the supraoptic nucleus and                 the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus undergo                         morphological changes reflecting an increase in manufacture and                 release of neuropeptide hormones from the pituitary.   Dr.                      Beagley will determine whether non-painful stressors can change                 the ultrastructural features of cells in these specific regions                 of the hypothalamus.  Undergraduates will be involved extensively               in these experiments and will learn state-of-the-art anatomical                 techniques including ultramicrotomy and electron microscopic (EM)               procedures.  This project will not only generate important new                  information about how physiological and psychological stressors                 result in rapid morphological changes in the brain but also                     provides an excellent opportunity for students to become exposed                to exciting and timely research problem.",
