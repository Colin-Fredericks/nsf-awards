The laser lab will be  used to modernize three aspects of the curriculum at Weber  State University: 1) Upper-division Modern Physics Lab  experiments; 2) Applied Optics Lab experiments; and 3)  individual research projects. Typically, 15 students per year  are involved with these courses. The Laser Lab also permits the  future addition to the curriculum of an advanced undergraduate  modern optics course.  The Laser Lab allows students in the Modern Physics Lab to  undertake experiments involving laser induced fluorescence, and  atomic structure, lifetimes and collisional processes.  These  experiments demonstrate many of the fundamental aspects of  quantum mechanics.  The Applied Optics course at Weber State University has a  strong laboratory component.  The Laser Lab gives the students  \"hands-on\" experience in the assembly, alignment, operation,  and use of various laser systems.  Laser spectroscopy is well suited for undergraduate research as  both the basic theory and the experimental apparatus are within  the grasp of juniors and seniors. The Laser Lab is expanding  the undergraduate research options to include atomic,  molecular, and optical physics. Thus, students are being better  prepared for future industrial or graduate school work in this  critical field.  The laboratory has been designed with individual workstations  which which simultaneous operation of several experiments. By  inserting a mirror or two, the laser beam(s) can be directed to  each station as needed.  ***",
