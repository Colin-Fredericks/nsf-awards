 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-diffraction based crystallography is essential to materials               design and process understanding in key industrial applications,                such as micro-electronics, superconductivity, solar energy,                     structural composites and metal forming.  The scanning electron                 microscope (SEM) has the potential for providing high spatial                   resolution crystallographic information, but its applicability is               severely limited by the low sensitivity of existing techniques.                 The current methodology cannot be easily used for dose sensitive                materials, electrical nonconductors and samples with even small                 amounts of surface damage.  The difficulty of obtaining micro-                  diffraction data is a major drawback in the SEM, which otherwise is             very useful in obtaining high resolution topographical and                      compositional information and usually requires minimal specimen                 preparation.                                                                                                                                                    This Phase I program will determine the feasibility of employing an             energy filtering detector with high gain to increase the                        sensitivity of micro-diffraction in the SEM.  The filter will be                applied to backscattered electron patterns that can provide                     crystallographic information at very high spatial resolution.  This             study will require an amplifying element that is sensitive to low               energy electrons, such as a microchannel plate.  The research will              test the overall feasibility of this approach as well as the                    specific issues of dynamic range and noise level.                                                                                                               Exploitation of the proposed research would improve the competitive             position of domestic industries by enhancing their capability to                identify components and define aggregate properties related to                  advanced materials and processes.  In addition it would extend the              functionality of a large existing base of scanning microscopes used             in academic and industrial research.",
