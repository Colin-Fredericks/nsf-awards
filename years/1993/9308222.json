 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is made to the University of California/Davis in                     support of a career planning workshop for underrepresented                      minority undergraduate chemistry majors. The workshop will be                   held August 7-9, 1993 at the Davis campus and will be the first                 of its kind in the western states. The objective is to bring                    minority students together with high-achieving minority mentors                 from industry, academia and government in order to introduce                    the students to the opportunities created by obtaining an                       advanced degree in Chemistry. The workshop will be hosted by                    the University of California Davis Chemistry Department and                     will provide opportunities for the student participants to                      observe graduate research, advanced laboratory instrumentation,                 and to meet with graduate students to discuss areas of mutual                   interest.                                                                       %%%                                                                             This award is viewed as a way of encouraging interested                         minority undergraduates to continue their studies in Chemistry                  by introducing them to successful minority role-models in a                     supportive setting. The longer term objective is to increase                    the participation of minorities in the chemistry enterprise.",
