It asks how far apprenticeship, beyond transferring technical knowledge, also reinforces or redirects social values initially learned at home.  The project will also critically examine the proposition that apprenticeships may allow youths to learn ne w interactional skills and so to widen their social networks beyond those of their parents, thereby managing the transition to an urban economy under conditions of sometimes rapid change.          The research site will be the Cretan coastal town of Rethemnos.  Crete is stereotypically regarded throughout Greece as the locus of both stern traditionalizing and extreme anti authoritarianism.  It is thus idea for exploring tensions between deference and insubordination in social ideology and practice.          The principal types of data to be collected, and the methods of collection and analysis, are both diachronic (biographies and genealogies) and synchronic (interviews), and also include videotaped artisan apprentice interactions.  For comparative purposes, biographies will be broken down into thematic units, yielding a clearer account of the idealized models of interactions.  The resultant data will be correlated with key social variables, including age, gender, origin, political affiliation, professions, and work status.  The genealogies should help to determine the reasons for the apparent avoidance of employing kin on the father's side, as well as the extent to which artisan represent an endogamous social class.  The segment of the project devoted to videotaping aims to identify clearly marked signs of deference and insubordination in the working relationship between artisans and their apprentices.          The research thus explores insubordination within a culture where authority is the object of unrelenting competition, in a way that goes beyond uncritical acceptance of social actors' often formulaic claims about inequality and the abuse of power.  In this way, it should also shed critical light on the processes that have created some of the most familiar stereotypes in the ethnography of southern Europe.  Finally, it will identify the practical rather than merely the ideal meanings actors attributed to social categories by examining the use of cultural markers such as gesture and langua ge.  ***   #    x   \\        P    C      X P#",
