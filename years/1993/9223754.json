The Indian scientist, Dr. S.K. Babu of the                                      Department of Dairy Bacteriology, College of                                    Dairy Science, Udaipur, India, is to study the                                  molecular mechanism of bacteriophage infections                                 of lactic acid bacteria Lactococcus lactis.                                     This species of bacteria is required to make                                    many varieties of cheese, including the most                                    common variety in the U.S.  Dr. Babu will clone                                 and sequence spontaneously-occuring mutants in                                  the gene required for bacteriophage infection.                                  He will make copies of the mutant genes by                                      polymerase chain reaction.  Total chromosomal                                   DNA from each of the spontaneous mutants in                                     this gene will serve as the hybridization                                       template for the polymerase chain reaction.                                                                                                                     Scope:  This project helps a U.S. scientist who                                 is carrying on work of significant relevance to                                 the U.S. industry, through participation of a                                   qualified young Indian scientist.  It also                                      helps the Indian scientist by his involvement                                   in a multifaceted research program and learning                                 new techniques that he can implement later in                                   his home institute.",
