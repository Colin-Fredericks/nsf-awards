 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to develop an integrated introductory course                  in undergraduate science and mathematics by a team of faculty                   and professional staff in science, mathematics and psychology                   representing three of our four major campuses of Florida                        Community College at Jacksonville.  The work is integral to the                 College's long range plan to revitalize the curriculum and make                 learning an exciting and rewarding process.  The goals are to                   increase understanding and retention of complex subject matter,                 while at the same time make these enjoyable experiences,                        leading to the adoption of life-long learning habits by                         students.                                                                       Teaching faculty have teamed with psychologists versed in                       applications of learning and motivation theory to the classroom                 as well as in the application of technology to the learning                     process.  The faculty team will develop an introductory level                   undergraduate course combining the central themes of cycles,                    information, and change common across scientific disciplines                    including botany, microbiology, chemistry, physics, and                         mathematics.  The developers will team teach the course using                   strategies that integrate science and mathematics and focus on                  the interrelationships among the sciences and mathematics.                      The course will be delivered in electronic classrooms that                      allow team teaching via telecommunications systems providing                    graphic, audio and visual interaction between faculty and                       students located on both the North and Downtown Campuses.  The                  course will engage student in learning by discovery exploration                 and collaborative partnerships between students and faculty and                 administrators acting as mentors to student teams.",
