 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hadwin will continue his work on approximate similarity and                on closures of direct sums of classes of operators.  He will also               study invariant operator ranges in a von Neumann algebra, and                   investigate a new version of K-theory based on operator ranges.                 In addition, Hadwin will study operator algebras from a purely                  algebraic point of view.  This is expected to contribute to both                operator theory and abstract algebra.                                                Operator theory is that part of mathematics that studies the               infinite dimensional generalizations of matrices.  In particular,               when restricted to finite dimensional subspaces, an operator has                the usual linear properties, and thus can be represented by a                   matrix.  The central problem in operator theory is to classify                  operators satisfying additional conditions given in terms of                    associated operators (e.g. the adjoint) or in terms of the                      underlying space.  Operator theory underlies much of mathematics,               and many of the applications of mathematics to other sciences.",
