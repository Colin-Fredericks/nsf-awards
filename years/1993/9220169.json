 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of this research is to elucidate the                    molecular mechanisms by which membrane immunoglobulin generates                 proliferative or inhibitory signals to the interior of the B                    lymphocyte in response to antigen binding at the surface.  Since                the membrane immunoglobulin receptor shares many characteristics                with tyrosine kinase dependent growth factor receptors, an                      understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in B lymphocytes             will benefit the greater community of cell biologists by                        contributing to an understanding of proliferative control in a wide             variety of cell types.  In particular, preliminary evidence which               suggests that membrane immunoglobulin heavy chains are linked to a              diverse group of proteins, some of which are src family tyrosine                kinases, while others appear to be cytoskeletal constituents will               be pursued.  Biochemical and immunological methodologies will be                employed to explore the molecular topology of membrane                          immunoglobulin and membrane immunoglobulin-associated proteins.  A              particular focus of the project will be the possibility that the                function of membrane immunoglobulin may be controlled by structural             associations which are dependent upon receptor clustering.                      %%%                                                                             Most types of living cells respond to external signal molecules                 such as hormones or growth factors by undergoing a cascade of                   biochemical changes that result in various physiological changes.               Growth factors, for example, are signals that trigger a chain of                biochemical events leading to cell division.  The steps in such                 cascades of events are generally referred to as \"signal                         transduction\".  This project will study the early events in signal              transduction following binding of a signal molecule to its specific             receptor protein in a cell membrane.  The specific goal is to                   identify and characterize molecules in the cell membrane or in the              cell's interior (for example, protein molecules that constitute the             cell's internal skeleton) that bind to and/or chemically modify the             receptor and each other after the receptor binds its signal                     molecule.  Identifying the cellular components that interact with               this receptor in response to a signal should contribute                         substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms of signal                  transduction in cells.",
