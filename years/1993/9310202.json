Arousal regulation theories in these fields have advanced markedly              over the last three decades reflecting increased theoretical and                methodological sophistication. Yet, these advances have occurred                relatively independently. Because arousal regulation processes are              multiply determined, integration of diverse theories and methods                should advance understanding of arousal regulation processes                    substantially.                                                                                                                                                  This research will examine the viability of the biopsychosocial                 (BPS) arousal regulation model. The BPS model is applicable to a                broad range of arousal-based psychological phenomena and behaviors.             Recent BPS research has demonstrated consistently that cognitive                appraisal of potentially evocative situations mediates                          physiological responses such that challenge appraisals result in                increased myocardial reactivity and threat appraisals in increased              vascular reactivity. These data represent the first demonstration               of the fractionation of cardiovascular responses as a function of               categorically different appraisals of an active coping task. This               research will help disentangle apparently conflicting literatures               linking cardiovascular reactivity to both performance increments                and increased risk for heart disease. The experimental tests of the             BPS model proposed are based on theoretical and empirical  work                 from diverse areas including affect, self-esteem, and mere                      presence. A series of five experiments employing both self-report               and physiological measures will examine intrapersonal and                       interpersonal variable moderating cognitive appraisal and autonomic             reactivity as specified in the BPS model.                                                                                                                       The results of this research will not only have important                       implications for the BPS model but also for theory and research in              the domains of the moderating variables (e.g., affect and self-                 esteem) themselves. In addition, the results of the research will               have direct implications for cardiovascular and mental health.",
