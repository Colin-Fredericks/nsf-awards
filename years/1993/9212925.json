 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Outwork,\" the practice of industries to employ laborers,                       frequently women and even children, work on products at home,                   remains an issue among factory workers today.  Outwork is greatly               affected by changing technology.  At times, technology negatively               affects the ability of workers to practice their craft at home; at              other times it enhances it.  Dr. Mohanty is studying the US textile             industry and the ways in which new machines upset the weaving                   processes, the ways weavers worked, and the things weavers wove.                She has collected data on a large group of two different kinds of               weavers in Rhode Island:  men engaged in the traditional practice               of the craft and women engaged in outwork brought into existence by             changes in spinning technology.  By comparing these two groups, Dr.             Mohanty is providing new insights into the complex ways in which                mechanization alters labor patterns.  Her study also links how                  specific changes in loom technology causes shifts in the different              types of fabrics hand weavers use in order to profit in the                     marketplace.  She finds that, contrary to popular impression, the               first phases of mechanization actually increased opportunities for              outworkers who reacted differently to technical change than did                 traditional craft weavers.  This study promises significant                     contributions to our understanding of the interaction of technology             and the way we work during periods of rapid technological advance.",
