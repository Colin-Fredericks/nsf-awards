 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase I of this study had examined the design characteristics of                machinery enclosures as an application for noise control by                     active cancellation. Reduction of noise transmitted through                     structures is a need that pervades a wide variety of situations.                In this approach, noise reduction at low frequency is achieved                  via active control concepts, and at high frequency--using passive               control. Performance estimates for control demonstrate the need                 for multiple actuators to cancel enclosure transmitted noise                    throughout the active control frequency range over the full                     spectrum of spatial angles. In Phase II of this research project,               the emphasis is on developing analytical and numerical models of                three-dimensional enclosures and assessing the role of                          structural-parameters in achieving the objectives of a low-                     frequency noise filter; evaluating surface observer options;                    developing cost-effective approaches for actuating the surface                  panels; evaluating alternative sensors and design concepts for                  embedding them into a surface panel module; developing a specific               design for a prototype enclosure including primary structure and                surface modules with sensors and actuators; and experimentally                  evaluating the above concepts using the prototype enclosure.***//",
