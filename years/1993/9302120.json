 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302120  Burdige      Previous work has begun to illustrate the important role that  dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes from marine sediments play  in oceanic and sedimentary carbon cycling. At the same time,  benthic fluxes of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) represent a  poorly quantified component of sedimentary nitrogen  remineralization that may be similarly important in oceanic and  sedimentary nitrogen cycling. The goals of this proposal are  therefore to continue studies of benthic DOC fluxes, and to begin  studies examining benthic DON fluxes.  Pore water DOC an DON  studies will also be carried out in conjunction with these flux  studies.  In part, this work will examine the characteristics of  pore water DOC and DON as they relate to the controls on benthic  fluxes of DOC and DON. Our proposed work will be carried out at  sites in the Chesapeake Bay on the California continental margin.  Studies in continental margin sediments are of particular  interest since several lines of evidence suggest that carbon and  nitrogen cycling in margin sediments (and benthic fluxes of DOC  and DON from margin sediments) may play important roles in  oceanic carbon and nitrogen cycling. Given the range of  characteristics among the sites chosen, the data  will provide further insights into the factors controlling  benthic fluxes of DOC and DON.  These results will be used to  improve estimates of the global DOC flux from marine sediments  and to initiate a similar examination of the role of benthic DON  fluxes in oceanic and sedimentary nitrogen cycling. Finally,  these new results will be used to critically examine a model  which may describe the relationship between benthic DOC fluxes  and overall rates of benthic carbon remineralization.",
