 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for an exhibition on Native                      cultures of Alaska and Siberia for travel to Native and non-                    Native communities in rural Alaska.  The exhibition consists                    of 200 small artifacts from Siberian and Alaskan                                archeological and ethnographic museum collections, archival                     photographs, Native craft and traditional arts, 20th century                    graphic arts, and videos.  Curriculum packets and                               educational materials and videos will be prepared for use in                    the exhibition venues.  These instructional materials,                          including an exhibit catalogue, will be designed to serve as                    \"stand-alone\" components as well.                                                                                                                               The Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center has selected                              \"Crossroads of Continents *RFD Alaska\" as a prototype                           project that will lead toward establishing standards for                        museum-based educational outreach programs for use in native                    communities in rural regions where professionally staffed                       museums usually do not exist.  This goal is especially                          challenging in Alaska, where distances are great, population                    centers are small, and there are unique problems of                             transportation, communication, security, and language to be                     overcome.                                                                                                                                                       The project is an ideal one in that much of the basic                           research for the exhibition has already been accomplished.                      What is needed now is to develop a Native education                             component and local initiatives to accompany the core                           exhibit, and to produce the exhibition and the exhibition                       catalogue.  Once developed, the experience of this project                      will serve to guide future programs not only in Alaska, but                     also throughout the Circumpolar North.",
