This is an interinstitutional collaborative research. Design,  implementation and experimentation activities are conducted at both  sites.  Active databases present a novel and promising paradigm for  programming databases.  The Heraclitus project supported by this  grant is focused on the development and application of database  programming language constructs and techniques that can be used to  specify and implement active databases.  A central thesis of the  project is to elevate \"deltas\", i.e., sets of proposed  modifications to the database state, to be first-class citizens in  database programming languages (DBPLs).  While deltas have been  used before in limited contexts and ad hoc ways, the Heraclitus  languages permit programmers and users to freely create, manipulate  and apply deltas.  This offers the potential of developing novel  mechanisms for supporting a variety of applications including  active databases, database interoperation, hypothetical database  access, concurrency control protocols, backup and recovery  protocols, and resolving conflicts between updates.  The research  is centered around the development of a DBPL called  Heraclitus Alg,C , an extension of C that incorporates the  relational algebra and deltas, and persistence for relations and  deltas.  A variety of topics are being studied in connection with  Heraclitus Alg,C , including language design, optimizations,  parallel implementations, theoretical issues, and applications to  active databases and database interoperation.  The research will  yield fundamental insights into active database technology, and  also methodologies for using this technology so that diverse  databases connected by the \"information highway\" can be used in a  coherent manner.   ***",
