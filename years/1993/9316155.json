 "awd_abstract_narration": "9316155  Tsai    The use of composite material in complex engineering structure has  generally been limited to high-cost and handmade traditional  multidirectional laminates substructure.  The design and  manufacturing processes of structured composites have also been  dominated by try-and-error approach.  For civilian applications,  cost estimation and durability of design must be emphasized.    Today, industry is lack of innovative design and construction  methodology for design and manufacturing of composite structure for  low-cost civilian applications.  Nearly all manufacturing methods  used today are by batch rather than continuous process.  An  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Composites  Design at Stanford University could provide a better mechanism to  achieve efficiency and economy in design and manufacturing in terms  of energy consumption, dual-use technologies, and friendliness to  the environment.  The Center will focus on the integrated composite  design and manufacturing technology such as grid structure of  thermoplastic composites and continuous manufacturing processes for  low cost civilian applications.    A planning meeting was funded by NSF to study if industry would  support an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for  Composites Design at Stanford University.  A number of companies  have committed to support this effort.  Currently, there are six  sponsors for the Center committing approximately $360,000.    The Principle Investigator/Center Director and his colleagues are  internationally recognized in this area and have the knowledge and  facilities to run this Center.    The proposed research projects will address:  1) optimization of  grid panel and shell composite design; 2) process modelling of  thermoplastic tape; 3) research in methodology of testing,  inspection, maintenance, and repair of composite material;  4)manufacturing of thermoplastic composites.    This Center has been coordinated with Dr. John Scalzi, Program  Director of L arge Structural & Building System, Division of  Mechanical and Structural Systems at the NSF.    The Program Director recommends Stanford University be awarded  $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.    Near the end of each 12-month period the Program Manager and/or the  Division Director of the engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria, including the following:  1) the extent to which the  university-industry interaction is developing; 2) the extent to  which the support base is developing; and 3) the extent to which a  robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
