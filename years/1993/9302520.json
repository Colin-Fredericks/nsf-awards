 "awd_abstract_narration": "A striking feature of the development of mathematics in the                past decade has been the extent to which the diverse branches of                mathematics have interacted, with methods from one branch being                 used to solve outstanding problems in another.  Culler and                      Shalen's ongoing program for obtaining lower bounds for volumes                 of hyperbolic manifolds is in large measure an application of                   qualitative results from topology to quantitative estimates in                  geometry.  Their program for the Property P conjecture would be                 likely to exploit K-theory and arithmetic geometry in attacking a               problem from the topological theory of 3-manifolds.  Culler's                   project of implementing Manin's program by means of Thurston's                  theory of pleated surfaces is a way of using synthetic hyperbolic               geometry to obtain insight into number theory.  Finally, Shalen's               project involving fundamental groups of 2-complexes lies in the                 domain of geometric and combinatorial group theory but is                       motivated in part by the prospect of applications to the study of               discrete subgroups of algebraic groups and Kac-Moody groups.                         Three-dimensional manifolds are the mathematical models of                 our physical universe.  While the cosmological question of                      whether our universe is finite may be unresolved, it is certain                 that the study of finite-volume 3-manifolds is of fundamental                   importance in understanding the physical universe.  The                         quantitative estimates obtained by Culler and Shalen may be                     regarded as being mathematical analogues of measurements of                     fundamental physical constants, such as the speed of light.  The                geometry, as well as the topology, of the universe is important                 in physics.  While the non-euclidean geometries may have been                   considered curiosities in the nineteenth century, the development               of general relativity shows that negatively curved spaces, such                 as hyperbolic 3-manifolds, are the appropriate models for the                   universe.  Recent mathematical research has shown that they are                 ubiquitous and mathematically rich as well.  The research                       proposed here is aimed at expanding our understanding                           of these important spaces.",
