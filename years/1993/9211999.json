 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal, we plan to continue our theoretical                           investigations on the wave and particle dynamical properties                    associated with ultra-low-frequency magnetic pulsations in the                  Earth's magnetosphere.  Specifically, we propose to study the                   following aspects of the drift-Alfven-ballooning modes: (i)                     numerical investigations of the stability properties in self-                   consistent, anisotropic, high-B magnetospheric plasmas: (ii)                    gyrokinetic analyses of associated particle flux modulations;                   (iii) nonlinear wave-particle interactions between energetic                    ring-current ions and instabilities; and (iv) nonlinear mode-                   coupling effects on the instabilities.  (i) and (ii) thus deal                  with the linear aspect of the wave excitation mechanism and the                 purpose here is, by comparing with satellite observations, to                   identify the mechanisms both qualitatively and quantitatively.                  (iii) and (iv) meanwhile examine the nonlinear consequences of                  the instabilities in terms of both the saturated wave amplitudes,               spectra and induced particle diffusion.  Theoretical results will               be compared with available observations.  This proposal                         constitutes a major portion of a Ph.D dissertation project and,                 hence, a three-year grant is requested.",
