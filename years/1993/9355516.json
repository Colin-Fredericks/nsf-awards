 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355516  Kagan  Dr. V. Kagan is a faculty member at the Department of Environmental  and Occupational Health at the University of Pittsburgh.  He is a  world recognized leader in the field of free radical and  antioxidant research.  His current research program includes  extensive ESR studies of free radical mechanisms involved in the  activation of Ca2+ release channels in sarcoplasmic reticulum  membranes.  Dr. V. Ritov is the Associate Research Professor of  Biochemistry at the Department of Biology, State University of  Moscow.  With his systematic studies of Ca2+ transport and  mechanisms of its regulation, he has gained an outstanding  reputation as a biochemist.    The presence of Dr. Ritov in Dr. Kagan's laboratory at the  University of Pittsburgh on a daily basis will greatly facilitate  the joint studies on the involvement of free radicals and  antioxidants in fundamental physiologic mechanisms of functioning  of Ca2+-release channel in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes.  Dr.  V. Ritov will have access to unique ESR techniques for free radical  studies developed in Dr. Kagan's laboratory which he will be able  to use in his research upon his return to Russia.  Dr. Ritov's  visit to the US will enable him to interact with American  scientists directly and will enhance his international scientific  reputation that he deserves.  The visit of Dr. V. Ritov to Dr.  Kagan's laboratory will significantly strengthen the collaborative  research in their laboratories both in the US and in Russia.  ***",
