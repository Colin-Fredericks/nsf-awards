 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353500  Stanley    This project builds on earlier and concurrent projects to develop  materials for students which incorporate the concepts of randomness  in nature.  Participating teachers, and ultimately students, are  given the opportunity to discover and explore natural phenomena in  much the same way a scientist would.  Using existing units  including random walks, accretion and percolation, many activities  have been and are being developed which relate to each of the  sciences.  Examples include the growth of nerve cells, lightning  strokes, termite tunnels, erosion gullies, tree roots, and forest  growth.  Lessons such as these can be included in existing courses  or be combined to make a complete one year course on  interdisciplinary science.    An important aspect of this project is the reeducation of the  teachers to assume different roles.  Teachers become guides,  mentors and coaches to students.  Instead of the more traditional  mathematics and rule based science, the students build their  understanding of processes and relationships through exploring  natural phenomena.    The project trains 32 (country-wide) teachers the first summer and  two groups of 32 teachers each of the following two summers for a  total of 160 From each group of 32, 10 teacher leaders are selected  to assume additional roles and to help train additional teachers.    The cost sharing is estimated at 43%",
