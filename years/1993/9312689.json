It is important for  social stability in democracies to know how legal institutions  sustain themselves.  Most courts have no access to the powerful  legitimizing process of elections, while at the same time they are  often charged with making decisions contrary to the preferences of  (sometimes impassioned) majorities.  Why do citizens comply with  unpopular decisions of courts?  In the absence of stores of  institutional legitimacy, compliance itself is a problematic  question.  These problems of legitimacy and compliance assume even  broader importance in the context of emerging transnational legal  institutions like the European Court of Justice.  The European  Court of Justice, the high court of the European Community, has  become the most powerful judicial institution in Europe and has  been the single institution most effective at promoting the  integration of Europe.  In light of its increasingly salient and  controversial decisions, it is important to ask how this court is  acquiring political legitimacy and how willing are individual  Europeans to accept its decisions.    This project investigates the connections between legitimacy and  compliance, focusing on the European Court of Justice.  It focuses  in particular on change in mass attitudes toward the Court, on how  these attitudes are formed, evolve and ultimately affect popular  willingness to accept Court decisions.  The data collection will be  by survey of a panel of respondents (300 in each of seven countries  that are members of the European Community).  The projects promises  to make a significant contribution to the scientific understanding  of legitimation processes and how legitimacy affects compliance.  ***",
