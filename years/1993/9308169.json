 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the incidence of racial violence in five                     southern states in the 1980s, exploiting the archives of the Center             for Democratic Renewal (CDR) to construct a data base.  First,                  nonconfidential CDR data on incidents of racial violence and the                public activities of white supremacist organizations will be coded              into machine-readable form.  Next, a county-level machine-readable              file of demographic, economic, and political statistics on each                 county in the five state research region will be created, primarily             using the 1980 and 1990 censuses.  These files will be merged to                permit examination of factors that may predict such violence in the             1980s: local economic conditions, racial and ethnic composition,                activities of white supremacist organizations, rapid social change,             historical patterns of anti-black violence.                                                                                                                     The research will test sociological theories of racial violence,                thus contributing to scientific sociology in the fields of social               movements, race relations, and group conflict.  It will contribute              to the knowledge base for policy decisions concerning racial                    conflict in contemporary American society, and indirectly it will               help decision-makers understand the increasingly difficult problem              of ethnic violence world-wide.",
