It follows on from the                               Site Effects Workshop held at the University of                                 New York at Buffalo in 1991.                                                                                                                                    Financial support for this workshop is provided                                 by the National Science Foundation, the                                         National Center for Earthquake Engineering                                      Research (NCEER), the U.S. Geological Survey                                    (USGS) and the Southern California Earthquake                                   Center (SCEC).                                                                                                                                                  The need to examine the soil categories and site                                factors (S factors) used in building code site                                  response provisions arises from: (a) concerns                                   with the existing definitions of site factors, and                              (b) the fact that current building code provisions                              (that is, soil factors S1 through S3) were                                      developed in the mid-1970's (S4 was added                                       following the 1985 Mexico earthquake).  The                                     need for this workshop is further highlighted by                                the accumulation in recent years of extensive                                   research data and new knowledge on site                                         response effects.  It is strongly supported by                                  committees involved in: (a) the planned 1994                                    revision of the NEHRP (National Earthquake                                      Hazard Reduction Program) Recommended                                           Provisions for The Development of Seismic                                       Regulations for New Buildings; and (b) by the                                   Structural Engineers Association of California's                                (SEAOC) 1993 planned revision of the \"Blue                                      Book\".  The results from this workshop will                                     provide essential input and recommendations to                                  these committees' activities.                                                                                                                                   The workshop involves geotechnical engineers,                                   seismologists and structural engineers.  It is                                  planned to publish the workshop proceedings in                                  March 1993.",
