 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311037  Numbers  Science and religion have had a long and at times contentious  relationship in the United States.  Within the past decade,  advocates of more fundamentalist Christian sects have argued that  many of the theories of contemporary science, especially the theory  of evolution, have been advanced by a \"religion\" known as secular  humanism.  The fundamentalists have offered an alternative  creationist theory and have convinced at least two state  legislatures that the opposing theories should have equal standing  in biology classes.  In his dissertation research, Mr. Sheldon is  examining the development of \"secular humanism\" and its  relationship to science in 20th century America.  His objectives  are to understand the role of science and religion in humanist  thought and the ways in which prominent scientists and popularists  have adopted humanism as a framework for the presentation of the  history, discoveries and methods of science.  The project focuses  on John Dewey, H. J. Muller, Carl Sagan, B. F. Skinner and others.    The project involves a thorough survey of the primary humanist  journals in America as well as published works of the principal  actors and critics.  In addition, Mr. Sheldon is using interviews  and archival research to provide crucial data on the institutional  development of humanism and its relation to scientists and their  ideas.  ***",
