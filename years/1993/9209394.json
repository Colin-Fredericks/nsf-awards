 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to build a theoretical framework for when              to learn.  Machine learning, which studies the automatic                        acquisition of new concepts, has largely focussed on developing                 mechanisms for learning.  Questions such as \"How can an AI computer             system come to form a general concept in response to a relatively               few observed training examples?\"  and \"What prior knowledge is                  required to support such concept acquisition?\"  have dominated the              field.  However, it has become clear that the unbridled acquisition             of concepts (even correct concepts) can degrade the performance of              the AI system that they are intended to help.  In sophisticated                 applications, such as arise in AI planning, a performance penalty               for learning can be the rule rather than the exception.  Thus,                  machine learning mechanisms cannot be successful unless suitably                restrained.  Unfortunately, the judgement of when to learn is                   itself complex.  The benefit of a new concept depends on features               of the performance system as well as the machine learning                       mechanism.  It can also be strongly influenced by the expected                  profile of tasks to be given to the performance system and by the               concepts that have previously been acquired.                                                                                                                         The proposed research is intended to produce a fist theory of              rational learning.  The learning component of an AI system is a                 rational learner if the AI system's behavior is guaranteed, on                  average, to be improved by the acquisition of any new concepts.                 Such a theory must provide a general framework for the interactions             between a machine learning system, the performance system that                  employs the acquired concepts, and characteristics of the estimated             distribution of tasks.  The research will explore both empirical                and analytic approaches to estimating expected concept utility.                 The area of planning will serve as a vehicle for the work, but the              results will likely be applicable to other performance systems.                 Explanation-based methods form the nucleus of learning methods                  since it, more than the inductive approach, seems liable to the                 phenomenon of detrimental learning.  The benefits of the research               will include an enumeration and taxonomy of the types of rational               learning.  It will shed light on which machine learning mechanisms              may be most useful to which type of AI systems, and represents some             first steps towards making machine learning a service area for the              rest of AI.",
