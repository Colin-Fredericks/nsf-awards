 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Long and his                       colleagues will continue their research both to improve the                     radiocarbon dating technique and to provide accurate dates at a                 reasonable cost and in reasonable time to the archaeological                    community. The laboratory will continue to seek out and analyze                 samples of anthropological significance. It will apply techniques               which allow the dating of non-standard materials such as pollen and             individual bone amino acids to such samples. It will also continue              research to improve the dating technique itself and will focus on               the cause, nature of impurities in benzene which is used in liquid              scintillation counting.                                                                                                                                         To work most effectively, archaeologists need to assign absolute                ages to excavated materials and radiocarbon dating has provided the             primary technique for accomplishing this goal. Organic materials                such as charcoal dating to 40,000 years or less are routinely dated             by this means and Dr. Long's laboratory is now able to extend the               technique's range to ca. 70,000 years. The laboratory also has the              ability both to analyze very small amounts of material and to                   purify contaminated remains such as bone. Through such dating work,             the laboratory has addressed important anthropological questions                such as when plants were first domesticated in the New World and                thus shed light on the development of cultural complexity.                                                                                                      This grant is important because it will permit the laboratory to                continue both its service and method development functions. It will             aid many archaeologists in their research.",
