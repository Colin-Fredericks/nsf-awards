 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in experimental physical chemistry involving Edward R. Grant of                 Purdue University and Helene Lefebvre-Brion and Christian                       Jungen of the University of Paris-Sud.  The objective of this                   research is to integrate experiments with interpretive theoretical              and computational efforts in laser spectroscopy.  The Purdue                    research group will concentrate on experiments for producing                    rotational state data on radiationless decay processes in highly                excited polyatomic molecules related to autoionization.  The                    Paris group has developed the theory which describes the                        relevant molecular photoionization processes underlying these                   experiments. Preliminary results of this collaboration have                     stimulated theoretical activity on the coupling limit of electronic             and rotational angular momentum. And initial theoretical results                have suggest prototypes for study of cation-electronic scattering               dynamics in polyatomic molecules.                                                                                                                               Dr. Grant brings to this collaboration his expertise as a                       spectroscopist and dynamicist.  This is complemented by the                     theoretical expertise of the French investigators in modern                     molecular spectroscopy, in particular, the Multichannel Quantum                 Defect Theory which offers a universal framework for                            understanding intramolecular dynamics.",
