 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to prepare solid-state inorganic oxides,               phosphate fluorides, and fluorides that may find use as optical                 frequency converters and laser crystals.  Preparative work with                 frequency converters involves the develpment of crystal chemistry               of selected borates.  The understanding of these materials are                  advanced with the computation of microscopic hyperpolarizabilities              (beta) from macroscopic d coefficients and continuing applications              of the anionic group theory.  Work with laser hosts focuses on the              development of materials in the STACK family and synthesis of new               phosphate fluorides and fluorides.  The synthesis of these                      materials should provide a variety of new crystals for study in                 diode-pumped or high cross-section, high-power laser systems.                   %%%                                                                             The objective of this work is to synthesize and study new solid-                state ceramics that may be used as laser crystals or optical                    second-harmonic generators.  Simple concepts in reaction and                    crystal chemistry are implemented in designing or selecting new                 materials that have suitable optical characteristics and can be                 grown as large single crystals.  Optical studies of these materials             provides the basis for testing and developing the applicability of              the concepts and materials themselves.  The realization of                      materials having superior characteristics may well afford new                   sources of high-power laser light for applications ranging from                 industrial manufacturing to the generation of x-rays for living-                cell holography.",
