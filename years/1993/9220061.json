 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220061  Parmentier         The studies will explore the physics of high Rayleigh number,  3D thermal convection in an infinite Prandtl number fluid based on  numerical experiments.  Numerical experiments completed thus far  for a volumetrically heated fluid cooled from above show that fluid  below the thermal boundary layer at the top boundary is  substantially non-adiabatic, contrary to the usual assumptions  about the structure of thermal convection at high Ra.  The  structure of the flow consists of nearly axisymmetric plumes that  are fed by the cold boundary layer.  Linear structures, that would  presumably represent subduction zones in the convecting mantle,  appear only infrequently.  The PI will carry out further numerical  experiments that include heating from below as well as volumetric   heating.  The principal innovation is a multigrid iterative solver  for buoyant viscous flow that is an order of magnitude or more  faster than the FFT methods that have frequently been used in 3D  convection problems.  The PI will extend development of multigrid  solvers to buoyant fiscous flow with variable viscosity.  This will  be carried out by solving equations formulated in primitive  variable (pressures and velocity components) rather than in vector  streamfunction and vorticity or some other potential function  formulation.  The first application of this new methodology will  be to understand how temperature and depth dependent viscosity  modify results of the constant viscosity, high Rayleigh number  numerical experiments.  ***",
