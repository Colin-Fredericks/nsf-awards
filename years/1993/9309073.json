 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prashant Kumta  Abstract    The current and future emphasis in packaging technology are aimed  at achieving high device densities.  These development place  stringent requirements on substrate technology.  The substrates  need to possess good heat dissipation and signal propagation  characteristics.  Several compromises seem to be essential to match  the device output characteristics with the economics of the  process.  A composite material with optimum thermal and dielectric  properties would offer an ideal solution to this problem.  A  colloidal processing technique combined with a unique  microstructural design is proposed to process a glass-ceramic  composite with optimum thermal and electrical properties.  Modified  metal oxide sol-gel (MOSG) process utilizing inexpensive metal  oxide precursors is proposed to synthesize borophosphosilicate  glass-ceramics.  An in-situ solution coating technique will be used  to introduce the thermally conducting second phase.  Systematic  control of the processing parameters such as temperature, solution  viscosity, sintering time, and volume  fraction will be initiated  to generate a duplex microstructure in the dense composite  containing a continuous network of the thermally conducting phase.   The three main objectives of the proposed   study are:  (1)  Synthesis of the glass-ceramic composite material using the  modified solution approach (2) Systematic study and control of the  evolved microstructure of the glass-ceramic composite and (3) To  understand the effect of the gel structure and the process  variables (volume fraction, coating thickness, gel structure,  sintering time, temperature) on the microstructure and its  properties, using  thermal analyses, X-ray diffraction, scanning  and transmission electron microscopy.  The effect of the  microstructure on the electrical and thermal properties will also  be assessed by measuring the dielectric constant, thermal expansion  and thermal conductivity of the dense composites.    The present approach  offers a novel method to process dual phase  composites with a contiguous microstructure and can be easily  extended to process other glass- ceramic, ceramic-ceramic or metal-  ceramic composites for electronic and structural application.  ***",
