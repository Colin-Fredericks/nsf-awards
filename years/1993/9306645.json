 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jonathan Kenoyer, Mr. William Belcher                will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will both                   conduct an ethnographic study in Pakistan and apply the results to              the analysis and interpretation of fish remains recovered from                  Indus Valley archaeological sites. The Harappan civilization                    developed and flourished in the Indus Valley from ca 2,600 to 1,900             B.C. It represents one of the great achievements of the late                    prehistoric world. Developments there rank the region with ancient              Egypt and the Near East as well as New World states such as the                 Inca and Aztec empires. However much less is known about the                    Harappans than their counterparts. Archaeological data shows that               this civilization had a strong riverine component and that fish                 constituted a major part of the diet. However such faunal remains               are difficult to interpret and Mr. Belcher hopes to develop                     approaches which will aid in this goal. To this end, he will study              modern fishing practices in the same region. He will interview                  fisherman and watch them at work to determine when in the yearly                cycle, how, and in what environments particular species are caught.             He will also observe how they are butchered, preserved, transported             and consumed. After they are discarded such faunal remains may                  undergo a number of destructive practices such as damage by                     domestic animals and Mr. Belcher will examine these as well.                    Finally he will apply the interpretative techniques he develops to              a series of Harappan archaeological remains.                                                                                                                    Mr. Belcher's primary interest lies not in fish per se, but rather              in the social and economic organization of the Harappan state. By               examining this one class of data, he hopes to reconstruct the                   economic system through which they moved. Trade routes will be                  reconstructed and the degree of economic centralization determined.             It may also be possible to examine such issues as status difference             between and within sites.                                                                                                                                       This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how one of the great early civilizations of                the Old World emerged. It will help to develop techniques of faunal             analysis which will be useful in many archaeological contexts.                  Finally it will assist in the training of a promising young                     scientist.",
