The semiconductor equations will be represented as equivalent circuit  components and solved using a public domain circuit simulator. Besides the inherent advantage of providing mixed mode device and circuit simulation capability embedded in a circuit  simulator, this technique can also be used for extracting the device  and circuit level model  parameters to match measured data through optimization.  The PI  will utilize this simulation  tool to develop ultrafast photodetectors and monolithic receivers.  There exists a growing consensus that the process, device, and circuit simulation tools used  as separate entities need to be integrated into a combined simulation environment for efficient  design and optimization of semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. The proposed research will incorporate the transient device simulation into a public domain circuit simulator  providing the researchers with an integrated simulation tool. Such integration will shorten  the development cycle for new technologies by providing accurate predictions of various physical phenomena on the device and circuit level and by allowing the investigation of detailed  device behavior within the circuit environment.  Optoelectronic devices are usually monolithically integrated with electronic circuits such  as amplifiers, especially for high speed applications. For better understanding of OEICs, a  simulation tool capable of transient analysis at device level which can be directly interfaced  with circuit level components will be invaluable. Besides its inherent advantages, mixed mode simulation technique can also be used for extracting circuit level model parameters  for new electronic and optoelectronic devices. This extraction technique will yield a very  fast method for model development for new devices.Using the capability of ac curately representing optoelectronic components we will design  novel structures. The design efforts will result in new optoelectronic devices and circuits  with operation bandwidths approaching 100 GHz. ***",
