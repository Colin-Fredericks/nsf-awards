 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term objective of this project is to predict the final,                tertiary structure of a protein given its amino acid sequence.                  Protein folding is the final step in translating the genetic                    message encoded in the DNA into a functional product.  This                     structure is very specific:  the mutation of a single amino acid                residue in one protein can cause transformation or eliminate                    viability of an otherwise healthy cell.  Although a very large                  number of protein sequences have been determined, only several                  hundred protein structures have been solved to atomic resolution.               Because the three-dimensional structure of most proteins is                     determined by the amino acid sequence, it must be possible to                   predict this structure from the primary sequence.  This award                   investigates several unique approaches to this prediction                       problems:  determination of protein secondary structure using                   novel neural net and artificial intelligence techniques,                        determination of the tertiary structure of omega loops based upon               amino acid rotamer libraries and constraints built into the                     structure of the omega loops themselves, and prediction of                      hydrophobic core residues in proteins.",
