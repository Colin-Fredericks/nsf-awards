 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues experimental research on institutions that               may offer an appropriate framework for negotiating solutions to                 externality problems such as global warming, pollution control,                 and common resources.  The institutions, known as compensation                  mechanisms, yield efficient outcomes for most externalities                     problems of interest to economists.  They also have attractive                  distributional characteristics in that they yield allocations                   that are competitive equilibria with the externalities priced at                marginal cost.                                                                                                                                                  This project investigates experimentally the performance of                     different compensation mechanisms for two-party unilateral                      externalities, public goods, general externalities structures,                  commons problems, and congestion problems.  The experiments are                 run both with and without full information.  The project also                   develops and disseminates a computer environment for NeXT                       workstations that captures the logical structure for all                        externalities problems.  As a consequence the same computer                     program can be used for all experimental work on externalities -                just the user interface and the payoff structure will change.",
