 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304279  Griess       This award supports research aimed at developing a theory  which will unite all the sporadic simple groups by means of  infinite dimensional groups.  Specifically, the principal  investigator will investigator the general structure of infinite  dimensional groups associated to lattices.  He will study finite  structures associated to Lie groups and develop a general theory  of automorphism groups of a class of nilpotence class 2 groups.   He will further classify finite subgroups of finite dimensional  simple Lie groups by data such as labeled Coxeter-Dynkin  diagrams.  The principal investigator will also work on a new  version of a moonshine module.       A group is an algebraic structure with a single operation.   It appears in many areas of mathematics, as well as, physics and  chemistry.  The fundamental building blocks of finite groups are  finite simple groups.  One of the major results in mathematics of  the past decade is the classification of the finite simple  groups, the proof of which would require 10,000 to 15,000 journal  pages.  This research is aimed at using this classification in  the study of arbitrary finite groups.  ***",
