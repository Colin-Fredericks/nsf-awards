 "awd_abstract_narration": "Executable specification is regarded as an important                            supporting tool for software system design, because it                          integrates the method of formal analysis, and the more                          experimental approach of prototyping and testing to analyze                     and to verify the design of a system at early stage of the                      software life cycle.  However, executable specification is                      still a virgin area in OO research. The motivation of this                      research is to bridge this important technological gap in                       the current OO research.  An executable design specification                    language for OO systems will be studied. The language is                        called extended G-Nets (eG-Nets), which is based on the                         theory of Petri nets, and the PI's previous work on the G-                      Net framework.  The design of eG-Nets represents a modular                      approach for software specifications in the sense that an eG-                   Net specification not only specifies the behavior of an OO                      system, but also the structure of the design.  EG-Net                           specifications are directly executable in distributed                           environment.",
