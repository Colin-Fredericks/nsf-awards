 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353788   Kerr    This project is a research-thorough-service effort aimed primarily at math/science talented at-risk  girls.  It involves the development, evaluation, and dissemination of guidance strategies for  helping girls to set and work toward career goals in math, science, and engineering.  Career  development interventions designed to encourage young women in math and science are often  ineffective.  Possible reasons for the failure of most interventions include the fact that they treat  career choices in isolation from relationship decisions; that they do not focus on girls' deeply  held values (especially social ones), and needs; and, that they do not use mentors and science  activities effectively.  This project proposes to create a career development intervention which  is relationship-oriented, values-based, and girl-friendly, and to test the intervention in an  experimental study with young women who have been identified by their counselors as  math/science talented young women at risk for giving up career goals.      The study will evaluate the effects of the career development intervention on goal-setting,  math/science self-efficacy, self-esteem, at-risk behaviors, and career-oriented behaviors.  The  results of the study and a description of the project will be disseminated through journal articles  and presentations for guidance counselors, as well as through direct experience of participating  pre-service and in-service counselors.  It has the potential for creation of  of an innovative  approach to career counseling for young women which may be effective in helping them to  choose meaningful career goals related to math, science, and eengineering, and to persist toward  those goals.  ***",
