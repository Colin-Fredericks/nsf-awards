The funding from the National Science  Foundation (NSF) will support primarily  individual American scientists to either travel  to or host colleagues from the former Soviet  Union and Eastern Europe for one to six months.   Up to 40 percent of the fellowships will be  provided for two-week project development  visits which allow participants to develop  plans for long-term cooperative research  projects, with special emphasis on developing  concrete proposals for submission to NSF's  FSU/EE cooperative science programs.  The  project development visits are also intended to  provide support for scientists to respond, with  relatively short lead time, to unusual  scientific opportunities of exceptional merit  and potential benefit to U.S. science.    Young investigators will be given special  consideration in the selection.  At least 25  percent of the fellowships, both in long-term  research and project development visits, will  be awarded to young investigators as an  encouragement to and investment in long-term  collaboration.  In the absence of a U.S.  government science and technology agreement  with Romania, the Romania twinning program will  continue to foster interaction between American  scientists and their Romanian colleagues, who  remain largely isolated from the international  scientific community.    A small portion of the requested funds will  support compilations of information about  science and technology development in the  region obtained through these individual visits  and other OCEE activities.    This project fulfills the program objective of  advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling  leading researchers in the United States and  Eastern Europe, including the former Soviet  Union, to combine complementary efforts and  capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest  and competence in the field of basic scientific  research on the basis of equality, reciprocity,  and mutuality of benefit.  ***",
