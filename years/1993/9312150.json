 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312150  Chapman  Supplemented by complementary work funded by Rockefeller Family  Associates, this planning project will begin to develop a process  whereby a wide variety of public organizations can participate in  a democratic dialogue about the aims of publicly funded scientific  and engineering research and development and the establishment of  a new National Forum on Science and Technology Goals.  The idea for  a Forum grew out of a recent proposal from an expert panel under  the auspices of the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and  Government.  The National Academy of Sciences is now pursuing this  idea.  This project will contribute to these efforts, by focusing  on the question of how to optimize democratic values such as  diversity, representation, equity, access, and reasoned dissent  within an institution such as the National Forum.  This project  involves representatives from a number of public organizations that  are concerned about participation in science and technology policy  making, in planning for broad-based meetings and related efforts to  initiate that dialogue.  In this planning period, the sponsoring  organization and representatives from several others will assemble  a diverse group of people interested in the National Forum.  These  people will meet in fall, 1993, to plan a larger, follow-on meeting  and a process through which diverse constitutencies can be heard on  the character, charter, and configuration of the National Forum.   The planning meeting will identify persons and organizations to  invite to the larger meeting and develop the content and structure  for it.  The planning group will consider and select case studies  of successful public participation in deliberations about and  resolution of science and technology issues to use at the larger  meeting.  The final plan will be presented in a report to the  Ethics and Values Studies program of the National Science  Foundation, and in proposals to public and private funding sources.  ***",
