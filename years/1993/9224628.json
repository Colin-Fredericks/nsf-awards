Holographic imaging, now possible because of advances in short wavelength lasers, is unique in its potential to achieve true wavelength-limited resolution because it eliminates optical elements and their imperfections.  In addition, holography records valuable phase and depth information.  This program focuses on developing imaging techniques that can achieve wavelength-limited resolution regardless of the illuminationg wavelength.  Such flexibility will enable application to many problems using a variety of sources, and the imaging capabilities will advance along with new short wavelength source developments.  The scientific information necessary for imaging at wavelenths shorter than about 200m, and particularly for developing a holographic microscope, will be pursued in a three phase research program.  First, laser-produced plasma sources and lasers will be used to measure the optical properties of recording films and typical object materials in the 200nm to 30nm region, where little information is currently available.  This information is required to guide the development of new films, to choose optimum illuminating wavelenghts, and to interpret images.  Next, techniques for high resolution contact microscopy will be developed, using the new films and atomic force microscope readout.  Images of test objects at various wavelenghts will be used to asses and verify film performance and image interpretation algorithms.  Contact microscopy is a proven high resolution technique,  and it will be extended to imaging real objects.  Finallly, with this background, the problems of reading high resolution holograms and numerically reconstructing faithful images will be investigated.  ***   v       s  t                  _ 0   , ,              c       )                      0   , ,    \u00d5                 #                    _ 0   , ,                      )                      0   , 9224628  Young  Microscopy using extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray radiation offers high resolution, high contrast, and chemica                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            {                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          $         $         $                                (                  F                    /                                                                                                    =             =                                 /  1 Courier    Symbol  & Arial  5 Courier New =                                   \"             h        E   E   E          8         I   R:\\WW20USER\\ABSTRACT.DOT     Cassandra Queen Cassandra Queen",
