The                 broad agenda is aimed at supporting the DDM community in new ways               that respond to the new mood in the country.  As an extension of                the DDM Advisory Committee work of April 1992, Integration                      Engineering will be the vehicle for projects that not only address              basic engineering-science, but also address issues such as:                     time-to-market, networked manufacturing, TQM, conservation, socio-              technical needs and human resource development.  Participants                   representing leaders from the engineering and business fields in                academia, industry and government will be invited.                                   The following highlights will be covered:  (1)  four keynote               papers on the needs for an expanded DDM program in Integration                  Engineering that can address major contributions to national                    competitiveness; (2) discussion groups on selected topics such as               Design, Planning, and Sensor-Based Manufacturing; (3) group reports             on the scope of new programs in Integration Engineering, with                   recommendations on the kinds of projects and initiatives that will              make major differences; and (4) a summary volume, prepared                      subsequent to the meeting on the way in which existing DDM projects             can be dove-tailed into the new initiative and how DDM can be                   responsive to the need for establishing projects that are both                  scientifically based and yet have impact on national                            competitiveness.",
