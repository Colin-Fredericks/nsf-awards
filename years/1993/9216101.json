 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for funds to upgrade the                        electronics and the data processing capability of an existing nine-             year-old Bruker WM-400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)                     spectrometer.  The five chemistry research groups that will be the              principal users of this instrument require NMR as an aid in their               organic and inorganic synthetic programs to identify products and               to determine product structures.  The proposed work requires a                  modern multinuclear NMR spectrometer with variable temperature and              sophisticated pulse control for current and future 2D FTNMR                     experiments.  The current instrument, which is the only research                grade NMR on the campus at Kansas State University, is nearly                   maximally booked, has a limited, obsolete data processing and data              storage system, and is encountering increasing difficultes in                   providing decoupled spectra or in performing DEPT, NOESY, and COSY              experiments upon demand.                                                             Two of the four principal users are currently supported by                 awards from the National Science Foundation.  Other faculty in the              departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry, Foods and Nutrition and                 Grain Science will also benefit from this upgrade and they are                  listed as \"other\" users.                                                        %%%                                                                                  This proposal will assist in the purchase of a modern nuclear              magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.  This instrument is an                   essential tool for faculty members at Kansas State University                   engaged in chemical research.  The instrument provides important                information which in most cases can be used to determine the                    geometric and/or molecular structure of newly synthesized                       molecules.",
