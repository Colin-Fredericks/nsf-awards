This organism can be easily cultured and manipulated like               a bacterium, yet it resembles higher eukaryotes in the regulation               of cellular processes like cell division and transcription.  Gene               amplification is being studied with the intention of describing the             initial events that deregulate normal cellular controls and allow               gene amplification to occur at a relatively high frequency.                     %%%                                                                             Gene amplification has been demonstrated in animal cells, but it                has been difficult to determine what happens in the earliest stages             of that process.  Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a fission yeast that             has a wealth of already described mutations affecting many                      different cellular processes, and studies of gene amplification in              this organism should provide insight into how it occurs in animals.",
