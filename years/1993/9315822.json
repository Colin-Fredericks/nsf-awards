In addition, this study will seek to determine the extent technology is used for entertainment purposes versus supporting extracurricular activities such as musical training programs. There is a dearth of information regarding the affect technology has on early childhood development.  Demographics are available which show a positive correlation between income, ownership of a home personal computer (PC), and the eduction of parents, among other traits, and children's school performance.  Yet, very little is known regarding how home technology such as PCs or video cassette recorders (VCR) or even television (TV) is used to promote learning.  This study seeks to explore the present usage of technology in American homes with children.",
