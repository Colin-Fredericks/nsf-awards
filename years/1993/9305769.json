 "awd_abstract_narration": "Absorption of visible light by ligand bound ferrous hemeproteins                such as hemoglobin (Hb) and myoglobin (Mb) results in a near                    instantaneous (less than 10-13sec) rupture of the iron ligand                   bond.  The photogenerated contact pair (heme plus ligand) can                   decay either  through reformation of the iron-ligand bond                       (geminate recombination) or through a progressive increase in the               iron ligand separation distance.  The objective of this project                 is to determine the role conformational disorder plays in                       controlling or modulating geminate recombination in Hb and Mb at                ambient temperatures.                                                                                                                                           The following experiments are to be pursued:                                                                                                                    1.  A double pulse excitation experiment with sub picosecond                        resolution designed to determine the time scale over which                      the protein solution is effectively an inhomogeneous                            distribution of conformational substates.                                                                                                                   2.  A time resolved (less than 1picosecond resolution) kinetic                      hole burning experiment using Raman and absorption to                           characterize the spectra of fast and slow recombining                           conformations.                                                                                                                                              3.  An experiment narrow sub designed to follow in real time the                    thermally driven dynamics of a population of conformational                     substates.  The narrow distribution is to be generated by                       using a weak 620nm femtosecond excitation pulse.                            %%%                                                                             A protein molecule can have any of a very large number of                       slightly different micro conformations.  At biological                          temperatures, a given molecule undergoes rapid interconversion                  among these different conformational substates.  It is possible                 that reactivity of a given protein is controlled by how                         frequently the protein assumes some highly reactive                             conformational substate.",
