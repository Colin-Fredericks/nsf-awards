 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the micro-foundations of the determinants of             the level and growth of productivity in developing countries by                 focussing on the roles of firm level research and development (R&D)             and job training expenditures.                                                                                                                                  The objectives of the project are to (1) describe the incidence and             patterns of firm level training and R&D expenditures; (2) study the             economic factors that influence firm decisions to invest in R&D and             training; and (3) the impact of R&D and job training on the level               and change in productivity at the firm level.                                                                                                                   At the heart of productivity growth is technological change.  In                rapidly developing countries, the encouragement of high technology              development is closely linked to a growth strategy which is export-             oriented.  Furthermore, at the microlevel, success at the exporting             game is often linked to large enterprises.  Here we link the three              forces of technology, export-orientation and productivity in                    determining firm investment decisions and their outcome.                                                                                                        This research is based on a unique and rich micro-database of the               Taiwan Census of Manufactures for the period from 1976 to 1991 that             covers all plants in the country's manufacturing sector.  Data on               firm-level R&D, training and export sales, virtually non-existent               for most countries, are reported in this database.  This data is                combined with recently developed microdata empirical techniques to              gain insights into the determinants and effects of key factors in               the industrial development process in rapidly developing economies.",
