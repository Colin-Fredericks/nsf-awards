 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of materials chemistry and in the subfield of               liquid crystals.  The thrust of this experimental activity is the               synthesis of new ferroelectric (chiral) smectic C* liquid crystals              (FLCs) which will markedly enhance the performance of electrooptic              and display devices based on the surface stabilized ferroelectric               liquid crystal (SSFLC) light valve.  FLCs have been shown to                    exhibit high speed, multistate electro-optic and display device                 applications, particularly when incorporated into the SSFLC light               valve. The two state (digital) nature of the SSFLC device                       possesses certain advantages in applications such as passive                    multiplexed flat panel displays but does not allow for a natural                gray-scale effect due to the lack of intermediate optical states.               Another effect observed in chiral smectic liquid crystals, the                  electroclinic effect, is based on the smectic A* phase and affords              a linear analog response to applied voltage.  Currently available               materials are limited by their sensitivity to temperature                       variation, and thus, need for temperature control.  This project                pursues a method to achieve temperature insensitivity, thereby                  greatly expanding the breadth of usefulness of this effect.  The                new materials will be both pure chiral smectic A components and                 mixtures of materials containing the new components with broad                  temperature ranges and fast electro-optic response times.                       Temperature insensitive electroclinic devices will fill the gap                 requiring a relatively temperature insensitive, fast (10                        microseconds) linear electrooptical effect.                                     %%%                                                                             In this SBIR Phase I project, Displaytech should demonstrate the                feasibility of the proposed approach to improving the performance               of electro-optic and display devices based on SSFLC technology                  that was developed earlier by this small business.  The results of              this research should provide clear guidance regarding                           Displaytech's proceeding with a Phase II activity.",
