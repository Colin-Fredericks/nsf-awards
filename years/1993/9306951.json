 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306951  Andrei    This project will investigate the finite frequency conductivity of  high-Tc superconductors.  The finite frequency response could  provide important clues to the understanding of the mechanism of  superconductivity in these materials.  It is also essential in  various applications such as the construction of low loss  transmission lines or resonant cavities, where the performance is  limited by the finite frequency dissipation in the superconductor.   The project will focus on developing a radio frequency  spectroscopic technique to measure the conductivity in the  superconducting state in the frequency range O.4-4 GHz.  At the  lower frequencies, the experiments will access an as yet unexplored  region of the rf conductivity of these materials.  %%%  This proposal investigates the resistance of high-Tc materials for  currents in the radio frequency range (overlapping FM broadcasts  and airplane radar frequencies).  The behavior of the resistance at  these frequencies has not been measured, and will provide  fundamental information about the high-Tc materials.  It is also  essential in various applications such as the construction of low  loss transmission lines or resonant cavities, where the performance  is limited by the finite frequency dissipation in the  superconductor.  ***",
