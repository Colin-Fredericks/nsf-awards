 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309978  Lucas    Financial markets play a central role in channeling savings to  productive investments and allowing individuals to share and  reduce risk.  If these markets were complete and frictionless,  savings, investment, and asset prices could be analyzed without  consideration of factors such as idiosyncratic risk, transactions  costs, and market structure.  But empirical evidence suggests  that individual consumption patterns cannot easily be explained  by aggregate consumption alone, as would be the case if there  were complete risk-sharing.  Casual observation also suggests  that there are potentially important frictions in financial  markets due to brokerage fees, illiquid markets and so on, and  that information problems and legal restrictions limit the extent  of feasible contracts.  The contribution of this project comes  from developing theoretically rigorous and empirically tractable  models in which individuals face aggregate and idiosyncratic  income shocks, and have limited access to financial markets.  The  goal of this research is to better understand the effect that  borrowing and short sales constraints, transaction costs and  other financial market imperfections have on aggregate savings,  investment, the level of interest rates, risk premia and trading  in financial markets.      Of particular interest are the implications of a decline in  financial market transactions and increased market access, as has  occurred over time.  The project examines how these factors  affect risk premia, the amount of risky investment and the  distribution of asset holding in the economy.  Further, the  project examines whether financial innovation should be expected  to increase or decrease the overall level of savings in the  economy.  Determining the net effect of financial innovation on  equilibrium savings and investment will have implications for our  understanding of how financial innovation affects the growth path  of the economy.  To assess some of these predictions, empirical   relationships will be estimated using data from sources such as  the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Survey of Consumer  Finances.  The project also looks for more direct evidence on the  extent to which asset holdings are used to buffer idiosyncratic  income shocks.  ***",
