 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project uses survey research                and multivariate data analysis to investigate how Protestantism                 affects the propensity of Guatemalan and Costa Rican citizens to                engage in various forms of political action, including voting,                  campaign activity, contacting public officials, and community                   activism.  The study focuses on the direct effects (of religious                affiliation and beliefs), the indirect effects (via the effects of              Protestantism on literacy, gender roles, and economic status), and              interactive effects (between Protestantism and variant political                and social environments) of Protestantism.                                                                                                                      The significance of this research is that it will lead to a) a                  description of the multiple forms of Protestantism that are                     currently diffusing throughout Latin America, and b) analysis of                the multiplicity of effects that any given kind of Protestantism                may have in different social and political contexts in Latin                    America.  The study will address both traditional concerns with                 religion as a predictor of political attitudes and actions and                  questions of how religion may be viewed by politicians and parties              as a vehicle for mobilizing or demobilizing various populations.                This research will also have implications for the study of religion             and politics in other regions where variant forms of religion                   interact within a larger social context to produce regognizable                 patterns of political action.",
