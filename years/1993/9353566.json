 "awd_abstract_narration": "NOVA'S CENTURY OF DISCOVERY is a series of five prime-time                      documentary specials to be shown nationally over the Public                     Broadcasting Service(PBS) during late 1997 or early 1998.                       Altogether the programs will tell a sweeping story,                             celebrating the end of a remarkable century of discovery when                   science advance further than in all previous centuries                          combined, and when every scientific discipline underwent a                      revolution.  Yet the closing of the 20th century coincides                      with an ever-widening gap between what scientists know and                      what most of the public comprehends.  To increase public                        understanding of science, scientists, and scientific methods,                   the series will provide a dramatic retelling and                                interpretation of the century's most enduring scientific                        endeavors.  Each two-hour program will probe several related                    fields of investigation and application: views of the universe                  and of matter; origins of the planet and of life; health,                       medicine, and the human body; human nature and behavior; and                    technology and engineering.  A marriage of scholarship and                      entertainment,  NOVA'S CENTURY OF DISCOVERY will be created                     using all the tools at the command of its award winning                         production team including archival footage and stills;                          personal accounts; letters, dairies, and other primary                          sources; computer animation; and even dramatic re-creations.                    Indeed, the series will not only make a unique contribution to                  the public and historical record, but also offer viewers an                     unprecedented opportunity to view 100 years of scientific                       pursuits as a unified whole, to recast their perceptions of                     science and scientists, and to be intrigued, even inspired, by                  a view of science as a never-ending and very human quest for                    answers and solutions.  A special outreach and promotion                        campaign will increase audience awareness of the series,                        particularly among nontraditional PBS viewers.  In addition,                    carefully developed teaching and learning materials will                        extend the series' reach into formal and informal educational                   settings, including high school and college classrooms, and                     community and youth-serving organizations.",
