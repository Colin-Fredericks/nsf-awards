 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science Museums of Charlotte, Inc.  will develop a 5500                    square foot traveling exhibit on SCIENCE of FASHION for the                     Science Museum Exhibit Collaborative (SMEC).  Opening in                        February 1994, SCIENCE of FASHION will tour eight major U.S>                    cities over thirty-two months, introducing 2.5 million people                   to principles of chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics, and                  technology that drive the textile industry.                                                                                                                          SCIENCE of FASHION integrates diverse disciplines and                      will help public explore science in a wholistic manner.                         Because the subject matter is somewhat unusual fare, SCIENCE                    of FASHION will help diversify audiences, drawing in                            population segments, particularly women, who may not normally                   visit science museums.  SCIENCE of FASHION is an eloquent                       vehicle for science-rich exhibitry which teaches the                            mathematics of pattern geometry, production statistics, and                     retail costs, polymer chemistry for engineering new fabrics,                    the genetics of new natural colors and strong aware fibers,                     and the sophisticated research, robotics, and computerized                      technologies that keep America's textile  industry at the top                   international commerce.                                                                                                                                              Rigorous evaluation will ensure a satisfying product that                  is educationally-effective, durable, and appealing to a broad                   public audience.  SCIENCE of FASHION will be a worthy addition                  to the rich menu of science fare in SMEC exhibitry.",
