 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308981  Saavedra  Multithreading, along with software prefetching, lock-up free  caches, and weak consistency models, has been proposed as an  effective hardware mechanism for mitigating the pernicious  effects of the large latencies expected to be present in massive  parallel machines.  This research focuses in studying the extent  to which virtual multithreading can be used to hide the long  delays incurred by synchronization events.  Virtual  multithreading gives the illusion that the processor is executing  a large number of threads using only a small amount of resources.  Preliminary results indicate that, with sufficient hardware  support, the combined execution of the virtual threads can be  used effectively to hide extremely large synchronization delays.    The goals of this research are: 1) explore new hardware  mechanisms for the support of virtual threads and evaluate their  cost-performance tradeoffs;  2) develop analytical formulas to  model the effectiveness of virtual multithreading in terms of the  most relevant machine and program parameters;  3) investigate the  dynamic behavior of fine-grain parallel programs with respect to  synchronization and use this information to construct models of  program execution; and 4) develop a detailed simulator of a  virtual multithreaded-based parallel machine and run an extensive  set of experiments in order to validate the analytical models and  hardware mechanisms.  ***",
