This  will be a statewide program with science camps offered in three  Michigan sites each year.  These sites will be in Lansing/East  Lansing, Pontiac and Benton Harbor.  Each site will operate with  its own staff but with a common set of goals and a common  disciplinary focus.  A professional development workshop for staff  will precede the camp.    The young people served will be African-American, Hispanic-American  and Native-American students from the Lansing, Pontiac and Benton  Harbor areas.  These students will be entering the seventh, eighth  and ninth grades in the fall of 1993.  Three commuter camps, each  enrolling 60 students, will be held.  In addition, a five-day  residential camp, with an environmental focus will be held at the  Kellogg Biological Station at Gull Lake.  One Hundred and eighty  students will participate in a program that will include  mathematics, science, and environmental and computer science.   Parents of participants will be expected to attend selected  sessions and work periodically as program volunteers.    Nine Saturday morning sessions for participants will be held at  each site during the academic year.  A recognition program for all  participants, funded by Macmillan/McGraw Hill Publishing Company,  will be held at Michigan State University in the spring of each  year.  The summer science camp program will address the need for a  scientifically literate population and reversing the declining  aptitude, interest and participation in science by underrepresented  groups.  The science c amps will offer:       o    an environment, conducive to learning science and  mathematics, with tools,           resources and expert teachers.       o    mentor relationships to nurture skills and predisposition  for science and          mathematics        o    four-week commuter summer science camp plus a one-week  residential camp with         opportunities to practice science and  mathematics with a problem-solving,          exploratory approach       o    a  series of half-day Saturday programs, one each month  during the academic year       o    strong parental involvement to support and guide the  interest and direction of the           child",
