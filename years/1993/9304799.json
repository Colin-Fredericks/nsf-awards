 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304799  Kunkel       Experiments in this proposal are designed to explore the  mechanism of activation of human small RNA gene promoters.  The  primary focus of these experiments is on the human U6 gene.  The  transcription of vertebrate U6 genes is carried out by RNA  polymerase III but the promoter is constructed of a number of DNA  elements used in pol II genes.  Furthermore, the U6 transcription  complex is composed, in part, of factors that are shared between  pol II and pol III promoters.  For example, the distal region of  the human U6 gene (more than 150 bp upstream of the transcriptional  start site) contains a consensus octamer motif found in the same  location as in the pol II-transcribed snRNA genes (e.g., U1 and U2  genes), and this element is bound by purified Oct-1 factor in  vitro.  Therefore, the U6 distal region is similar to the (pol  II)snRNA enhancer that activates transcription by one to two orders  of magnitude.  The objectives of experiments proposed in this  application are:  1) to map the extent of functional elements in  the human U6 gene distal control region.  Mutant templates will be  prepared by site-directed techniques, and analyzed in vitro by gel  mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays and in vivo by  transient expression in transfected human cells; 2) to isolate a  transcription factor that binds to the U6 distal region whose  presence has been detected already and is distinct from Oct-1  protein (Nonoct factor); 3) to characterize the step(s) in the U6  transcription initiation pathway that are controlled by activator  proteins.  Purified Oct-1 and Nonoct factors will be used for in  vitro transcription experiments in which transcription initiation  complexes are distinguished using various concentrations of  Sarkosyl or after rapid separation while attached to  bead-immobilized DNA templates.  The relative numbers of functional  transcription complexes, kinetics of complex formation and possible  differential effects on reinitiation by the activator  proteins will  be determined; and 4) to determine whether Oct-1 protein and Nonoct  factor interact or act independently to activate U6 gene  transcription.  The spacing between the Nonoct and octamer protein  binding sites will be altered systematically, and the effect on  transcriptional activation determined.  Furthermore, using a DNase  I footprinting assay, binding of these two factors to DNA will be  investigated to determine whether cooperativity exists.  %%%  This research is designed to elucidate how an important class of  genes are expressed at a high level in vertebrate cells.  This  class of genes produces the small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that are  essential for fundamental pathways of gene expression in all higher  cells.  The studies will dissect the DNA sequences for one gene in  this class (human U6 snRNA gene) that direct rapid RNA synthesis.   Then the investigators will identify important proteins that bind  to these DNA sequences and determine how these proteins stimulate  efficient production of U6 snRNA.  These studies will provide  important information on basic mechanisms that direct how specific  genes are highly expressed.  ***",
