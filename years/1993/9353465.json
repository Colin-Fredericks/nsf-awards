The project delivers short courses ranging from 2 to 14  hours to teachers on topics identified by the needs assessment.   Summer sessions are one or two weeks long and \"provide a forum for  additional instruction and acquisition of skills, and for  networking and sharing of problems and ideas.\"  Academic year  institutes include topics like Early Childhood Math, Marine Science  Project: For Sea, Music and Science in the Classroom.    Key to this project is that the local community or staff identify  their needs and receive support and help in those area.  Partners  in this project include the university, all school districts, and  the local community.  In this proposal, 45 schools are connected  via the Internet so they can reach mentors, share resources, and  interact with their colleagues in conjunction with and after the  workshops.    Cost sharing is estimated at 71%",
