Singer, Department of Chemistry, Ohio State  University, to pursue with Dr. Sungyul Lee,  Professor of Chemistry, Kyunghee University,  Korea, for 24 months, a program of cooperative  research on the electronic structure in dynamic  environments - clusters and condensed phases.   These collaborators will study solvated metal  atoms in rare gas clusters and will perform mixed  quantum/classical theoretical calculations on  these systems.  They hope to stimulate further  overlap between theory and experiments on  clusters.    The proposed research is part of a broad effort  combining quantum chemical and condensed phase  simulation techniques.  The U.S. and Korean  collaborators are highly respected scientists  with proven ability in the field of this  research.  Under this project, Dr. Lee will make  extended visits for cooperative research in Dr.  Singer's laboratory.  This project is relevant to  the objectives of the U.S.-Korea Cooperative  Science Program which seeks to increase the level  of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists  and engineers through the exchange of scientific  information, ideas, skills, and techniques and  through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  Korean participation in the project is  supported by the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's  research under NSF Grant No. CHE-9115615.  ***",
