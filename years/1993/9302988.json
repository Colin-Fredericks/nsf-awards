 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302988  McLaughlin       The investigator continues his research in the theory of  nonlinear waves, using a combination of mathematical theory,  formal approximation methods, and scientific computation.  In  addition, some of the projects in nonlinear optics will be done  in collaboration with members of the Department of Physics at  Princeton University who will provide a direct experimental  component to the research.  McLaughlin will work in three general  areas of nonlinear waves -- (i) temporally chaotic waves, (ii)  nonlinear optics, and (iii) spatially and temporally  chaotic waves.  In the project on temporally chaotic nonlinear  waves, mathematical methods from dynamical systems theory will be  adapted to the partial differential setting of waves.  The  project on spatially and temporally chaotic waves will develop  both stochastic and dynamical mathematical methods for the  partial differential equations of waves.  The projects in  nonlinear optics will focus upon laser light interacting with  liquid crystals. Because liquid crystal media are extremely  nonlinear, they provide excellent materials in which to study  ``light-matter''interactions.       All nonlinear waves in nature, from the light waves of  laser physics to water waves on the surface of the ocean, are  modeled mathematically by partial differential equations known  as nonlinear wave equations.  While linear wave equations have  been well understood for some time, scientists and mathematicians  knew little about the behavior of solutions of nonlinear wave  equations until the recent explosion in scientific computing  power.  While scientific computation can suggest and discover new  and unexpected behavior in solutions of nonlinear wave equations,  one can never be certain of the outcome of numerical experiments.   Mathematical studies, often of further idealized models, are  required -- not only to ensure the validity of the numerical  experiments, but also to establish qualitative behavior in the  model.  With results  certain for the model nonlinear partial  differential equations, physical experiments can then be used to  validate the wave equations as a description of real waves in  nature.  This project, taken together with the experiments in  nonlinear optics on the ``light-liquid crystal'' interaction,  addresses each of these related areas (scientific computation,  mathematical studies, and physical experiments) in the  mathematical studies of nonlinear waves.  ***",
