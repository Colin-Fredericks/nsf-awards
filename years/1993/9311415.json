 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311415  Martin       This project is to produce a video that fulfills three needs:   communication, education, and the stimulation of research on the  subject of solar prominences.  The central idea is to create a  unique research review paper by utilizing the descriptive and  pictorial advantages of video format.  The intended audiences are  scientists in astronomical and space sciences and their graduate or  undergraduate students.  One of the goals is to communicate recent  research discoveries about solar prominences to a wider audience  than is usually reached by publishing results only in journals.   The broader anticipated audience of scientists would comprise  plasma physicists, stellar astronomers, interplanetary and solar  investigators.  A second goal is to provide sufficient introductory  and background material to capture the interest of these viewers.   A third goal is to present the subject from a provocative,  questioning perspective which will stimulate work on key unsolved  problems about solar prominences.  The creation of this video is  proposed as a pilot video because of the potential desirability of  subsequently modifying and amplifying the video to appeal to a  wider audience of viewers at in college or highschool science  courses or at planetariums.  It is also an experiment in using  imagery to review scientific material in a format that is both  condensed and easy to mentally assimilate.  ***",
