Jackels of the Chemistry Department, Wake                       Forest University.  The long-term goal of the project is to use                 computational molecular modeling as a tool for the design of                    chelating ligands.  Large chelating ligands can surround and                    immobilize, that is, sequester metal ions and are useful in                     environmental applications for extracting metal ions, including                 radioactive ones, from solution and concentrating them for                      other uses.  By designing chelating ligands for particular                      conditions, they may be more effective in separating specific                   metals.  They also have potential in development of                             metal-containing radiopharmaceuticals for imaging and for                       therapy.  Dr. Jackels has synthesized and characterized ligands                 of this sort in the past and will through this project add                      molecular modeling expertise to her repetoire of tools that can                 be used for design and evaluation of their effectiveness.  This                 award will enable her to collaborate with computational experts                 at the University of Minnesota and at Battelle Northwest.",
