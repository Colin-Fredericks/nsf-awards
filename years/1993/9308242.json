 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for a workshop on performance                    analysis and user requirements for scalable parallel systems.                   The workshop, the fourth in the series, will be held in Keystone,               Colorado, during April 5-7, 1993.  During the previous 1988,1989,               and 1991 workshops, we recognized a pressing need for a                         continuing exchange of ideas on performance measurement and                     analysis among various groups engaged in high-performance,                      parallel computing.  These groups include the practicing                        scientists who use parallel systems and performance analysis                    tools, the vendors who design parallel systems, and the academic                researchers in high-performance computing who are exploring                     software tools and performance analysis techniques for parallel                 systems.  The proposed workshop is designed to bring together                   representatives of academia, industry, national laboratories, and               government agencies to explore these issues.  The discussions                   will focus primarily on issues of performance measurement,                      analysis,and visualization as they relate to these needs.",
