Stwalley of the University of Iowa will continue their                       investigations of the chemical dynamics of the reaction of                      hydrogen molecules with excited metal atoms, especially energy                  transfer collisons by means of  state-selective half-collision                  techniques.  Also continued are studies of the near threshold                   photodissociation dynamics of alkali diatomic molecules.                        %%%                                                                             The proposed experiments on reactions between excited metal                     atoms and molecules will serve to test theoretical models for                   such processes.  Significant deviations from the theoretically                  predicted behavior will require a revision of a model or at                     least place limits on its range of validity.  Theoretical                       models also exist for the photodissociation of alkali diatomic                  molecules.  In these models a dissociation is often viewed as a                 \"half-collision\" analog of a full collision process, the latter                 consisting of two incoming and two emerging particles.  Such                    theories are, however, often not amenable to simple physical                    interpretation and can not easily be applied to complex                         dissociation processes.  In some cases of current interest,                     such as collisions between ultra-cold atoms, the underlying                     physics is not understood well enough to allow application of                   any of the theoretical methods with confidence.  The                            experiments done in this research will provide information that                 will assist in the clarification of many questions in the                       domain of collision and photodissociation dynamics.",
