The program at the University                    of Chicago provides training for both Ph.D level scientists                     expert in this new technology as well as for training Ph.D level                optical astronomers in the application of adaptive optics                       technology and techniques.                                                                                                                                      The program consists of three parts:                                                                                                                                 1) Course work in astronomy, high resolution imaging                               and mathematical techniques in image processing                                 and data analysis.                                                           2) A laboratory program which develops new technology.                             This includes building deformable mirrors, ultra low                            noise detectors, and using high speed digital computers as                      well as developing new algorithms to process the                                data.  A 2 watt dye laser will be built and used for laser                      beacon tests in Arizona and New Mexico. A much more                             powerful new solid state laser will also be used to                             generate artificial beacons in the upper atmosphere.                         3) A research program which builds adaptive optics                                 systems and uses them on large astronomical                                     telescopes.                                                                                                                                             A SD10 69 actuator adaptive optics system will be moved to                      Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin where it will be used as the                    first AO system to feed a very high resolution spectrograph                     to be used for research on stellar seismology and a search                      for planets around stars. Two other systems are being built by                  students for use at the 3.5 meter telescope at Apache Point                     Observatory in New Mexico.  These will be the first laser beacon                adaptive optics systems available for astronomy. Students are                   encouraged to work with faculty to pursue new lines of astronomical             investigations opened up by use of data from the facility and to                improve the means of enhancing and interpreting the data.",
