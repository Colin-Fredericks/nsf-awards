 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical research will be conducted in two areas: phase                      transitions and noneqilibrium interfaces.  A new method of                      analyzing simulation data will be used, including finite size                   scaling of distributions of energy and order parameter.  This can               detect weakly first order transitions and accurately estimate                   exponents.  Extensions to systems with continuous symmetries,                   frustrated junction arrays and random systems will be made.  Two-               dimensional XY-like transitions will be studied to see if                       unambiguous numerical detection is feasible.                                                                                                                    Two aspects of driven interfaces will be studied by analytical and              numerical methods.  The first study is of the rough-smooth                      transition in dimensions greater than three and molecular beam                  epitaxy growth focussing on effects of initial conditions and the               connections between logarithmic and algebraic roughness in vicinal              surfaces.  The second study is of directional solidification and                eutectic growth driven by a moving temperature gradient by full                 phase, rather than interface, models.  Successful simulations in                one- and two-dimension interfaces have been done.  Extensions to                allow for thermal and external noise, a study of interface                      instabilities, and comparison to experiments will be made.                      Generalizations to include convective effects and to interpolations             between one- and two-sided models will be made.                                 %%%                                                                             The theoretical research focuses on two areas of broad interest and             importance in condensed matter physics and materials science.                   Sophisticated numerical techniques developed by the principal                   investigator will be exploited to determine the nature of the phase             transition in a variety of complex systems.  The results will have              profound impact on the study of phase transitions and critical                  phenomena.  In addition, the results will provide a better                      understanding of the real materials systems involved.  A second                 area of study will be the growth of interfaces.  This area is one               of fascinating fundamental interest, yet also has important                     ramifications for materials processing through crystal growth and               thin film growth.",
