 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to continue the development of tools based on                   Fractal Geometry for the description, generation and encoding                   (compression) of images, using automata-theoretic techniques.                   A design system will be developed based on Mutual Recursive                     Function Systems which should be specifically suitable for                      concise description (design) and efficient generation of                        images with a hierarchial structure and which are                               characterized by a mixture of order and chaos.  Images of                       natural objects typically have both of these properties.                                                                                                        The main goal is to improve the algorithm for image encoding                    (data compression) based on weighted finite automata (WFA).                     WFA can simulate wavelet transforms which constitute one of                     the best known methods for image compression.  This fact will                   be used to design an encoder combining the advantages of both                   the fractal approach and the wavelet transforms.                                                                                                                The theoretical properties of WFA as computers of real                          function will also be investigated.  This is a new application                  of finite automata with much potential, for example, the                        possibility of mechanical integration: an automaton computing                   a function of one variable can be converted to one computing                    the integral function of f.",
