 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovations in the manufacture of a very widely used                       electronic component, the circuit board, are considered.  In                    particular, fast photographic systems which would promote the use               of computer-controlled direct-write laser techniques are                        introduced.  The project concerns two advancements in direct-write              circuit board fabrication.  The first advancement involves the use              of techniques developed for integrated circuit microlithograhpy to              achieve increased photo-resist speed and a wider spectral range of              the laser direct-write exposure sources.  The second advancement                seeks to do away with photo-resist step by using a direct-write                 conducting wiring board pattern, followed by chemical and physical              development and copper plating.  The research will evaluate the                 feasibility of the concepts.                                                         Successful implementation of the concepts would enable mask-               free direct-writing of circuit boards at high throughput rates,                 typically five square feet per minute with five micron resolution.              The potential impact on small batch and prototype board markets is              high.",
