 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigations that coordinate phylogenetic analyses with                 explorations of the evolutionary processes are essential for                    understanding organismal diversity.  The proposed research,                     centered on the hydrangea family of plants, aims to resolve                     phylogenetic relationships among major groups of flowering plants.              This will be accomplished by focusing on key taxa in conjunction                with groups that are poorly known and considered \"anomalous\" in the             subclass Rosidae, many of which are Asian in origin and poorly                  known in collections.  Hydrangeaceae are positioned near the                    divergence of the subclass Asteridae, and this investigation will               increase our understanding of evolutionary diversification                      preceding the origin of subclass Asteridae with its great floral                conservation.                                                                         The proposed investigation has three facets: 1. phylogenetic              analysis using anatomical and morphological features of plants of               the hydrangea and dogwood groups positioned taxonomically among                 Rosidae and near the origin of Asteridae; 2. phylogenetic analysis              within the Hydrangeaceae family to distinguish natural groups of                species and genera and to explore patterns of flower and fruit                  evolution in the family; and 3. ontogenetic or developmental                    studies to determine roles of various cellular processes in the                 evolution of different floral and fruit forms.  An explicit                     phylogenetic framework will help guide the choice of critical taxa              in making comparisons for the study of different developmental                  processes that create flower and fruit diversity.",
