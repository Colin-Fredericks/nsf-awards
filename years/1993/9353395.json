Project activities are done  at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) where participating  teachers will have access to a state-of-the art materials and  engineering laboratory.  They will work in eight different areas  of engineering:  Computer Engineering, Materials Engineering,  Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Civil Engineering, Chemical  Engineering, Biomedical Engineering and Systems Engineering.    The major components of this three year project are:            two-Saturday workshops and a one-day program during            each academic year for 120 accomplished teachers;            two-week, all-day summer institutes for 30 commuting            teachers; sustained support and networking of teachers            with CWRU faculty; and            a requirement that institute participants conduct            engineering career programs for other teachers,            students, parents, guidance counselors and            administrators.    Workshop attendees will experiment with project kits, relating  \"real-world engineering problems\" to classroom activities.   Teachers will also engage in discussions and demonstrations of  various disciplines in engineering.  It is intended that the  hands-on experience with engineering projects and design will  provide content and new methods useful to them in teaching their  courses plus becoming a resource for career information.  ***",
