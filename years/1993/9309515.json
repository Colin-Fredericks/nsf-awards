 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309515  Morris    In the last twenty years, economists have made tremendous strides  in understanding the role of uncertainty and imperfect information  in the economy.  Applied fields as diverse as macroeconomics, labor  economics and industrial organization are increasingly focussed on  the superior information which some economic participants have  relative to others.    This progress has been possible because of the existence of a  standard, well understood model of how economic decision makers  make choices under uncertainty.  It is assumed that economic  decision makers can imagine every possible relevant event which may  have occurred in the past and may occur in the future.  Their lack  of complete information is reflected in the fact that - while they  can imagine all relevant circumstances - they do not in fact know  which circumstances have transpired or will transpire in the  future.  An implication of this standard approach is that whenever  an economic decision maker does not know something, he or she knows  that he or she does not know it.    This model provides a useful starting point.  But a series of  recent work, by the principal investigator and others, has focussed  on models of incomplete information which reflect the fact that  economic decision makers not only do not know which circumstances  have transpired or will transpire, but also they do not necessarily  understand what all the relevant circumstances are.  Thus we allow  for the possibility that a decision maker may not know something,  and may not know that he or she does not know it.    Thus the first objective of this research project is to complete  the principal investigator's development of a more realistic model  of choice under uncertainty.  But there is a critical conceptual  problem which arises in this construction.  Economists seek to  explain choices, including choices under uncertainty, as a  reflection of the decision makers' preferences.  But in  constructing a model of uncertainty, decision makers'  preferences  are part of the description of the relevant circumstances in the  world.  The second objective of the project is to provide a  hierarchical description of preferences which gets around this  circularity.  This will provide a solid analytic foundation for a  more realistic understanding of how economic decision makers cope  with uncertainty.    ***",
