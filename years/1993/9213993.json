 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first year of a three-year continuing award.  The                   research explores the information requirements of robot tasks, for              automating design of sensors from the specification of a robot's                task, its actions, and its uncertainty in sensing and control.  The             sensors provide precisely the information required by the robot to              perform its task, despite the sensing and control uncertainties.                The key idea is to generate a strategy for the robot task by using              a backchaining planner that assumes perfect sensing while taking                careful account of control uncertainty.  The resulting plan                     indirectly specifies a sensor that tells the robot when to execute              which action.  The sensor need not provide perfect information, but             only that information required for the plan to function correctly.              In contrast with traditional approaches to task planning which use              a bottom-up design that focuses on the sensor characteristics and               accommodates them, this approach is driven from the top, by                     questions such as \"given a task, what sensor characteristics and                tolerances are needed,\" and \"how does sensing depend on action.\"                The research investigates special purpose sensors for several                   simple assembly tasks, including multiple-peg-in-hole assembly,                 parts identification, parts orienting, and sorting.  The ultimate               goal is to develop task-level planners that can translate                       high-level task specifications into low-level robot commands.",
