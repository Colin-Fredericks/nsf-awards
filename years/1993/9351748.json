The microscope is being used by students throughout  upper level courses in the major, and a revised curriculum  culminates in senior research projects that integrate  microscope use.  The students are being trained to use the  microscope in Optical Mineralogy, where it is first being used  as a demonstration tool.  By the end of this course, students  are competent in hands-on use of the microscope.  As they  become proficient with petrographic techniques, students are  continuing to use the microscope in other upper level courses,  including petrography classes.  Seniors are designing  petrographic research problems during their winter field  course, and collecting appropriate sample suites in the field.   Upon their return to campus, they are gathering data to answer  the problems they are posing in the field.  The results are  being included in their Senior Research Reports, oral  presentations to the department, and talks at professional  meetings.",
