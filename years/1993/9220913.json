 "awd_abstract_narration": "Burning of fossil fuel, deforestation, and other activities                of modern civilization are increasing the level of carbon dioxide               (CO2) in the air.  Unfortunately, CO2 is one of the gases that may              cause global warming in the future.  Additionally, CO2 affects how              plants grow, and how groups of plants interact in ecosystems.                   Therefore, it is important for scientists to understand the factors             that influence the production and movement of CO2 in the earth and              atmosphere.  This knowledge will help people and their governments              prevent undesirable environmental changes.                                           Some of the CO2 in the air comes from the soil.  Plant roots               and soil microorganisms produce CO2 gas during an important                     biological process called \"soil respiration\".  The CO2 gas then                 percolates up out of the soil into the atmosphere.  Scientists in               Kansas will use special instruments to measure soil respiration                 from a tallgrass prairie.  Big tent-like chambers are used to                   fumigate the air above the prairie with CO2 in order to                         artificially create a high CO2 environment.  By measuring soil                  respiration inside the CO2 tents, the scientists will be able to                predict if more or less CO2 will come form the soil in the future.              This information will also help other scientists who are studying               global warming and other environmental problems.",
