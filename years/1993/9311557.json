Work will concentrate on  synthesizing clusters in which more than one bridging hydrogen  atom in hexaborane is replaced by a metal-containing moiety.  Using cluster expansion methods combined with bromide  elimination from bromoborane anions, novel metallaheptaboranes  will be prepared and characterized.  Tin derivatives of  pentaborane and hexaborane will be prepared and oligomers of  the simple stannylpentaboranes will be synthesized.  Because of  their usefulness in organometallic catalysis and their  potential as precursors of electronically important materials,  the goal of the project is to extend the types of  metallaboranes which can be prepared and determine their  properties.  %%%  Boron hydrides form in small regular structures, some of which  contain 5, 6, or 7 boron atoms and an appropriate number of  hydrogens.  While compounds in which boron has been exchanged  by a metal atom have been formed for other boron hydrides,  metallaboranes have not been investigated extensively in these  cases.  Dr. Barton will synthesize and study new metal  derivatives of penta- and hexa- boranes.  He will also try to  form chains of these species, forming solids which might be  useful ceramics for microelectronics.  ***",
