This project develops and  tests the first computer programs for analysis of extensive form  games.  The computer code (both source and executable code) that  is developed under this grant will be made available free of  charge for use in research and teaching by individuals in the  academic community.  This new software will open up the entire  field of game theory and all of the social science applications  of game theory to computationally intensive research.       More specifically, the project develops a computer program for  interactively building and finding sample equilibria for  extensive form games.  It also implements new algorithms for  finding all equilibria (for a given refinement of Nash  equilibria) for any given extensive form game.  The main program  will allow for interactive construction of an arbitrary finite  extensive form game.  It will be able to represent games of  incomplete information, as well as certain types of infinitely  repeated and stochastic games.  For any extensive form game, the  program will compute sample equilibria of the game, either on the  extensive or normal form, i.e., in behavioral or mixed  strategies.  In addition to Nash equilibria, the program will be  able to compute various refinements of Nash equilibria, such as  sequential equilibria, perfect equilibria, proper equilibria, and  simple stable sets.  One goal of the project is to develop a  capability for the program to calculate closed form analytical  formulas for an equilibrium as a function of a specified  parameter of the problem.  ***",
