 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will analyze the effective properties of a                   broad range of inhomogeneous materials that arise in many                       technologically and scientifically important applications.  One                 of the main thrusts of this work will be to obtain rigorous                     bounds on effective properties, such as conductivity and                        elasticity.  The investigators will consider general composite                  materials, particularly those composed of three or more                         components, which are particularly important in applications, and               for which there are many challenging mathematical questions that                remain open.  Also to be studied is the behavior of media whose                 components have highly contrasting properties and where                         percolation effects play the dominant role in the analysis.                     Examples where such an analysis is necessary include                            semiconductors, cermets, porous media, sea ice, and the fracture                of metals.                                                                      %%%                                                                                  There has been a dramatic increase in the use of composite                 and inhomogeneous materials for technological and scientific                    applications over the last two decades.  One of the key questions               underlying the efficient design and use of such materials is how                the arrangement of the various components determines the                        effective properties, such as strength or conductivity, of the                  composite.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to                     develop mathematical techniques which provide a quantitative                    understanding of this connection between mixture geometry and                   effective properties.",
