 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project brings together two groups of astronomers who are                  actively working on the abundance patterns in the stellar                       populations of the Milky Way Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds.                  The U.S. team, headed by Donald Terndrup of The Ohio State                      University in cooperation with Ruth Peterson of the Lick                        Observatory, will collaborate with Michael Bessell of the                       Australian National Observatory and the Mount Stromlo Observatory               and Elaine Sadler of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO). This               award provides funds for the U.S. investigators to attend                       observing runs in Australia. Using other sources of                             support, Terndrup and Peterson will conduct further observations                of bulge K giants at the Cerro Tololo Observatory in Chile while                Bessell and Sadler will do the same for globular cluster stars                  using Australian facilities.                                                                                                                                    Specifically, the program will conduct observations of bulge and                cluster stars to determine the abundance of oxygen and other                    alpha-capture elements. The relative abundances will generate                   information on the rate and manner of chemical enrichment in the                bulge of the Galaxy and in metal-rich globular clusters.                        Increased understanding of the temperatures and compositions of K               giants will be used to generate diagnostic indicators of                        temperature, metallicity and gravity for lower-resolution optical               and infrared studies of metal-rich stars.                                                                                                                       The project, supported jointly by NSF and the Australian                        Department of Industry, Technology, and Commerce (DITAC)                        provides access to international expertise and unique                           observational facilities.",
