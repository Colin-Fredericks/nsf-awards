The research aims at the study of                                  the metabolism and degradation of carbofuran, a                                 potentially toxic compound common to many                                       pesticides.  The study will be assisted by the                                  development of several mutant derivatives of                                    Pseudomonas sp. (P.sp.), itself a carbofuran                                    degrading bacterium, which have been developed                                  but which do not metabolize the same compound.                                  The study will: First, characterize the mutants                                 of P.sp.50432, by localization of the mutations                                 and the mutant genes, and identification of the                                 degrative gene product.  Second, develop gene                                   transfer techniques and vector systems for                                      genetic manipulation in P.sp. 50432 by                                          development of techniques such as                                               transformation, conjugation and                                                 electroporation, and construction of cloning                                    and expression vectors capable of replicating                                   in both E. coli and P.sp. 50432.  The project                                   includes a visit by the U.S. P.I. to Pakistan                                   to work with Ms. Mateen on a local research                                     program dealing with biodegradation of                                          xenobiotics.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  This project brings the expertise of a                                  junior research scientist from the Center of                                    Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) of the                                        University of Punjab, Pakistan to work with a                                   senior researcher from Oakland University in                                    Rochester, MI on a topic that is of significant                                 scientific as well as practical interest.  The                                  CAMB is one of Pakistan's most dynamic research                                 institutes with a number of young researchers                                   who are beginning to contribute to the world                                    research publications in the fast evolving                                      molecular biology field.  The linkage promoted                                  by this project is likely to benefit the two                                    scientists and enhance the potential for useful                                 joint U.S.-Pakistan research in the future.",
