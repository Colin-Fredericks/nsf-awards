 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, the Peabody Museum of                 Natural History at Yale University will computerize the records                 which relate to its Caribbean archaeological collections. These                 materials are now described under ca. 135,000 catalogue entries in              handwritten bound ledgers and this makes it extremely difficult for             researchers to locate either specific items or groups of materials.             Over a two year period museum professionals will enter these data               into a relational database system. As a result, the collections                 will be made easily available to archaeologists who wish to work                with them                                                                                                                                                       The Peabody's Caribbean archaeological collections are unparalled.              The material is the result of sixty years of systematic scientific              research in the islands of the West Indies and the coastal mainland             of Venezuela and the Guianas. It was excavated through research                 conducted under the auspices of the Caribbean Anthropological                   program which was founded in 1933. These data allow researchers not             only to establish chronologies but also to trace migration and                  diffusion. The materials can also be used to reconstruct                        environment, cultural process and social dynamics. They therefore               constitute a valuable scientific data base.                                                                                                                     This project is important because at the present time this                      information is extremely difficult to use. With NSF support it will             be made readily available for scientific research.",
