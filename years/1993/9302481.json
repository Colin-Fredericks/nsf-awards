 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the Arctic Noctilucent Cloud Campaign-93, the PIs               propose to make aircraft-borne and ground-based spectroscopic                   observations of the hydroxyl infrared nightglow as well as                      photographic observations of NLC.  These will be done to                        investigate the residual gravity and planetary wave fields present              during the Arctic summer and their possible relationship to the                 formation of mesospheric clouds.  The intent is to measure the OH               nightglow radiance and temperature from the NCAR aircraft.  This                will be done both to characterize the mesosphere in the NLC and PMC             regions and to examine the relationship of the mesospheric clouds               detected by the aircraft Lidar to the geographical characteristics              of the OH gravity waves and planetary-scale disturbances.  Next,                the PIs propose to characterize the polar summer mesosphere                     throughout the campaign with observations of the OH nightglow                   radiance and temperature from ground stations located at about                  60oN.  These measurements will be used to examine the temporal                  behavior of gravity waves and planetary scale disturbances and will             provide the context within which the aircraft data may be                       interpreted.  Finally, the presence of NLC will be photographically             documented over the ground stations in order to determine the                   occurrence frequency, extent, altitude and the structure and                    morphology of the NLC.",
