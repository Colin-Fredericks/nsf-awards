 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Nicaragua a relatively unique situation exists in which the             freshwater fish resource is being underutilized as a protein                    source.  Exceptional opportunities are present to develop this                  resource and increase the protein consumption of the rural inland               population of Nicaragua.  However the recent introduction of                    African tilapia threatens the entire natural ecosystem where they               appear to be spreading and dominating the local cichlid fauna.                  Their presence could collapse the fisheries valued at over 10                   million dollars.  This study will examine the expansion of the                  introduced African tilapia in Lake Nicaragua and continue long-term             studies on the ecology, reproductive biology and recruitment of                 Nicaraguan cichlid fishes.                                                      %%%                                                                             Numerous studies have documented the disappearance of one or more               species from bodies of water following exotic introductions.  These             studies have taken place after the species have been eliminated and             the precise mechanisms or causes for elimination remain                         hypothetical.  This study will examine, document, and understand                the actual process of fish invasions before native species, many                underscribed, disappear.  The results will be used to coordinate                management of the cichlid fish resource with the goal of                        maintaining the genetic diversity of the fisheries while at the                 same time maximizing the sustainable economic return to the people              of Nicaragua.",
