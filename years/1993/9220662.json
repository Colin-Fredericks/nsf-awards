 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support is requested for an intensive 9-day course entitled                     \"Molecular Biology and Development of Xenopus laevis\".  This course             will be offered annually in the spring as part of Cold Spring                   Harbor Laboratory's post-graduate education program.  The course                will provide extensive laboratory exposure to the biology and                   manipulation of embryos from the frog Xenopus laevis.  Xenopus is               a vertebrate uniquely suited for studies of early development                   because large numbers of embryos, from fertilization onward, can                easily be obtained.  Development is rapid, and the large size of                the embryos facilitates their micromanipulation to allow analysis               of the role of cell interactions (\"inductions\") in development, in              ways that are not feasible in mammalian embryos, such as mice.  The             course is particularly suited for those who have a current training             in molecular biology and knowledge of developmental biology, but                have had no experience with Xenopus.  Five main areas will be                   covered both in the laboratory and by expert lecturers.  These are:             (i) care and handling of adults and embryos, (ii) stages of                     embryonic development and anatomy (iii) whole mount in situ                     hybridization, (iv) microinjection of eggs and oocytes, (v)                     microinjection of blastula and gastrula stages, and induction                   assays.",
