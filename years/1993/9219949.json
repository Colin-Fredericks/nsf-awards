 "awd_abstract_narration": "Parasitic angiosperms attach to and penetrate their host vascular               system by the development of a highly specialized organ termed a                haustorium. The haustorium serves as a physical bridge that allows              the parasite to obtain the water and nutrients necessary for its                survival. The development of this unique structure is controlled by             a series of chemical signals from the host plant that condition the             germination, attachment and penetration stages of growth. Using a               combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches Drs. Timko and                   Riopel have begun to examine the biochemical and genetic mechanisms             involved in haustorial induction and development in Striga asiatica             (witchweed), a major parasite of agronomically important grasses.               They have standardized methods to synchronize growth of a large                 number of individual plant in order to look at sequential                       developmental stages (germination, radical extension, pre-                      attachment haustorial development, attachment, and host                         penetration) in axenic culture in 3-4 days. The overall goal of the             present experiments is to define the cellular and molecular genetic             events that constitute the developmental pathway in Striga leading              from haustorial initiation to successful attachment and penetration             of a susceptible host plant species. They propose to complete the               characterization of the putative root and haustorial specific cDNA              clones identified in the previous studies and initiate additional               rounds of differential screening to identify gene products                      expressed during the attachment and penetration phases of                       haustorial development. The goal of these studies is to establish               subsets of clones representing gene products temporally and                     spatially distinct in their expression during the pre-attachment,               attachment, and penetration stages of Striga haustorial                         differentiation. The patterns of gene expression activated during               attachment and differentiation of the penetration peg will be                   compared in Striga haustoria developed in contact with host versus              non-host tissues. Such information will assist in the subsequent                attempts to define the signal transduction pathway controlling                  overall haustorial development. A greater understanding of the                  biochemical and cellular factors governing haustorial                           differentiation may contribute to future manipulation of host                   resistance. When completed these studies will provide substantial               new information on a unique developmental process in plants.",
