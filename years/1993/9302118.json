 "awd_abstract_narration": "A lidar consortium consisting of Clemson University (CU), Utah             State University (USU), the University of Maryland (UMD), and the               University of Pittsburgh (UP) jointly propose a 2-year research                 program on middle atmosphere dynamics based on Doppler Rayleigh and             Raman lidar observations combined with other optical measurements               obtained at Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) and measurements of winds,              densities, and temperatures obtained from balloon and rocket                    flights.  (Proposals have been submitted by three institutions                  using the same text, but different budgets; UP will support this                effort through current NSF funding.)  CEDAR funding made possible               the installation in Utah of a Nd:YAG Rayleigh lidar system that had             been developed at UMD and moved to USU to be part of the BLO                    facilities.  The possible altitude coverage has been extended                   upward to 75 km with the addition of a 6 times more powerful                    frequency-stable Nd:YAG laser that was purchased by CU for use with             the lidar Consortium system.  This upgrade of the Maryland lidar                facility also includes one additional detector channel, which is a              Raman 607 nm channel that extends profile observations of                       temperature structure downward to the ground from 30 km.  The first             year of this proposed effort would continue observations of                     components - a high-resolution Fabry Perot etalon and a double-axis             mirror system - that are necessary for measuring the Doppler shift              of the backscattered Rayleigh and Mie lidar spectra to observe                  line-of-sight winds in the middle atmosphere.  A small radar system             will be added to observe line-of-sight winds in the middle                      atmosphere.  A small radar system will be added to shut off the                 laser transmitter when any aircraft is near the beam.  A new lidar              transmission channel will be added (607 nm) based on Raman-shifting             the Nd laser output in a high pressure Raman cell.  Upon completion             of these instrumental modifications at the beginning of the second              year of the grant award, application of the new Doppler lidar would             collect vertical profiles of middle atmosphere winds and                        temperature from clear-air portions of the atmosphere above 10 km               by using the laser returns from Mie (particulate) scattering and                Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm.  These profiles will provide the                 basis for examining the occurrence, structure, interaction, and                 variability of the jet stream, planetary waves, tides, and gravity              waves in the middle atmosphere above the extended mountainous                   region of the American Rocky Mountain chain.  The oblique                       propagation of these waves through the middle atmosphere as                     filtered by the prevailing winds in the middle atmosphere will be               related to the dynamic activity simultaneously observed in the                  mesopause region by several instruments at BLO.  Correlative                    observations of temperature, density, and winds will be made                    between the lidar and a combination of balloons and rockets.  A by-             product of the PIs observations will be the measurement of aerosol              backscatter and extinction in high clouds, particularly thin                    cirrus, and the detection of stratospheric aerosols.",
