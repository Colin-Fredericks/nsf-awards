The project which will                    have a strong minority focus, consists of five components:                      three week summer institutes for elementary teachers and                        secondary biology teachers; research experiences in                             biological sciences for secondary teachers; videotaped                          exchange sessions between master teachers and less                              experienced teachers (both elementary and secondary);                           seminars and workshops during the school year on issues in                      science and science teaching for secondary teachers; and a                      teachers network for science teachers in high minority                          school districts.                                                                                                                                               The summer institutes will be held at SUNY - Old Westbury.                      The first year institute, for secondary teachers, will                          address conceptual and pedagological issues in Neurobiology.                    The second year institute, also for secondary teachers, will                    focus on local ecology and related environmental issues.                        The third institute, for elementary teachers will provide                       basic knowledge in the natural sciences and introduce the                       method of conceptual change as a means of introducing                           scientific concepts into the elementary classroom.                                                                                                              Cost sharing equals 6.7% of the NSF award.",
