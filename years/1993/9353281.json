 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSC-9353281  East Bay Consortium of Educ.  Oakland, CA    Jaquez, Dolores and Gee, Victor    \"Pre-Collegiate Community Laboratory\"    This summer science camp, to be operated by the East Bay Consortium  of Education Institutions, Inc., and interagency collaboration of  19 Oakland-area schools, colleges, and universities, will serve 50  Black and Hispanic seventh and eighth graders who attend seven  schools in a severely educationally and economically disadvantaged  area of Southeast Oakland (CA).  The project site will be Merritt  College (Peralta Colleges).  Learning experiences will be offered  for five weeks per summer, with 12 Saturday follow-up activities  scheduled during the following academic year.    Classroom instruction will follow an integrated, multidisciplinary,  thematically organized model.  Themes have been chosen which  highlight applications of science and mathematics to events,  issues, and past-times of interest to the young target population.   These include the Loma Prieta earthquake and the accompanying  collapse of the Nimitz Freeway, the recent Berkeley fire, issues  related to pollution, development, and economic potential of San  Francisco Bay; the physics of sports movement; and implications of  mathematics for strong and durable construction.    Each class section of 25 students will be under the care of an  instructional team composed of a fully credentialed teacher quali-  fied in both mathematics and science, an upper division mathematics  or science major planning to teach in the public schools, and an  older high school peer mentor/role model.  The instructional team  will themselves model appropriate individual responsibility and  cooperative problem solving.    Instruction will follow accepted research practice.  Participants  will first observe phenomena and gather data.  They will then  analyze this information in an effort to form explanatory/  predictive hypotheses.  After testing their assumptions, they will  fine-tune their hypotheses and share their fi ndings with others.    Classroom activities will be supplemented by field study/research  throughout the greater Oakland area.  A culminating event of each  summer session will be a two and one-half day ecological camping  expedition at Pinnacles National Monument, jointly sponsored by  Naturalists at Large, who will provide onsite explanations and  guidance.  Additional field experiences will be offered in  academic-year follow-up sessions.",
