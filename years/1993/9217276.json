 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Brazil Cooperative Science Program                                    award will support collaboration by Richard                                     Hanlin of the University of Georgia and Maria                                   Menezes of the Universidade Federal Rural de                                    Pernambuco in Brazil.  The project aims to                                      collect, identify, and prepare illustrated                                      descriptions of Brazilian ascomycetes.                                                                                                                          Ascomycetes comprise a major component of                                       fungal flora in the tropics.  Many species grow                                 parasitically on plants; some cause diseases                                    that imperil crops.  They are often poorly                                      identified and understood.  The rapid loss of                                   native tropical flora makes it important to                                     learn as much about endemic fungi as possible                                   before more species are destroyed.  The                                         researchers, accompanied by two graduate                                        students working under Hanlin, will focus on                                    plant pathogenic species, but will collect                                      species from other substrates.  They will                                       verify identification by comparison with type                                   material.  Also, they will try to grow species                                  collected in pure culture and study possible                                    anamorphs.  U.S. and Brazilian students and                                     technicians will learn methods for working with                                 ascomycetes.  A book, Illustrated Genera of                                     Ascomycetes, will be published in Portuguese.                                   Both the U.S. and Brazilian sides will benefit                                  from the training of junior participants and                                    expansion of the knowledge base on endangered                                   ascomycetes in the tropics.",
