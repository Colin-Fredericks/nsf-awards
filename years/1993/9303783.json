 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-owned Research Vessel WECOMA, operated under a charter                  party agreement by the Oregon State University, has operated                    continuously for 17 years.  The average projected life of a                     research vessel is 30 years.  This project will make major                      modifications and upgrades to the vessel to prepare her for the                 second half of her operational life.                                                                                                                            The viability of an oceanographic research vessel to conduct the                changing needs of ocean science research diminishes with time.                  The modifications and upgrades will modernize the WECOMA and                    equip her to be as effective and reliable as when she was                       originally delivered for service in 1975.                                                                                                                       The improvements focus on three major areas.  Improvements to                   increase and enhance the ability of the ship to conduct ocean                   science research; upgrades to improve the day to day operation                  and maintainability of the ship; and refinements to improve the                 habitability of the ship.  Attention to all these areas will                    result in a vessel well equipped to continue a long standing                    tradition of good service to the community of ocean science                     research.",
