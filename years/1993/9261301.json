A key                                                        technical feature of acoustic                                                   waves in a properly designed                                                    superlattice structure is that                                                  they can have a phase velocity                                                  up to 10X higher than the                                                       normal acoustic waves.  This                                                    will remove the current high                                                    frequency limitation on                                                         Surface Acoustic Wave devices                                                   because of the corresponding                                                    increase in the sizes of                                                        electrode geometries required.                                                  The proposed effort is based                                                    on an innovative method for                                                     producing the required                                                          superlattice structure.  The                                                    risk associated with the                                                        effort is that it may take                                                      more effort than can be funded                                                  under a single SBIR program to                                                  perform a successful                                                            demonstration of this new                                                       technology.  However, the                                                       technical risk is judged to be                                                  small because the proposed                                                      approach is based on well                                                       established physical                                                            principles.  This program                                                       should have a high payoff in                                                    that the proposed effort would                                                  mark the beginning of a whole                                                   new field of endeaver in                                                        acoustics and is expected to                                                    yield rich dividents in                                                         numerous areas.",
