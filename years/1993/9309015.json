 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309015 Eberhardt  This is a standard award for Research Initiation to investigate several mechanisms for haptic transmission of graphical computer interface features, using four specially modified pointing devices.  The haptic sensory channel, which includes tactile and kinesthetic components, is capable of receiving high information rates, as demonstrated by skills such as haptic only speech reception and fine textural discrimination.  Studies are determining whether four haptic displays conveying (selectable) object position are capable of improving computer productivity (such as overcoming limitations in positioning the cursor) as measured with metrics for object acquisition and text manipulation speeds, as well as with subjective measures.  The first pointing device considered is a mouse with onset or offset of vibro tactile stimulation signaling whether the cursor is or not over a selected object.  The second is also a mouse but in this case its surface may be raised or not by the computer for display of the contour of the object to which we point.  The third is a trackball with force feedback implemented via x  and y directional friction brakes, for haptic guidance towards selectable features.  Finally, the fourth device is a contour display mouse mounted on an x y table allowing user controlled movements and force feedback via servo motors.  This research sheds light on whether force feedback aids or hinders manipulation speed, haptic  receptive capabilities, and effects of bimodal perception.  The devices may be useful also to facilitate the use of computers by individuals with impaired vision and with neuro muscular disorders.",
