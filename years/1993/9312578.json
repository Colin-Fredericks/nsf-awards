 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312578  Jones         This project is for the development of a two-course  introductory computer science sequence that uses results from  recent research in programming languages. A number of later courses  will be modified as well. Utilizing a new software environment and  working collaboratively with colleagues at Indiana University, this  project will incorporate Infer, a dialect of Scheme, with simple  and powerful semantics and a strong polymorphic type system.  Additionally, this language offers good support for modularity and  programming in the large. The additional rigor encountered when  learning to derive correct programs in such languages is expected  to promote computing as a science. By making the introductory  course equally challenging to all students, it is further  anticipated that these curricular changes will improve the position  of underrepresented groups in the discipline.         A significant number of students in introductory courses have  considerable experience of programming in some imperative language.  Since the similarities between different imperative languages are  more pronounced than their differences, other students with no  previous programming experience are often discouraged on observing  the comparative ease with which their peers approach the subject.  The curricular changes incorporated in this project are expected to  reduce the effects of this disparity in student backgrounds. With  all the students starting from scratch in a new and challenging  programming environment and new language, it is anticipated that  women and underrepresented minorities can be encouraged to  persevere. The project includes a plan for analysis and evaluation  of this hypothesis. Increased retention and eventually increased  enrollment of women and minorities are expected long-term results.         Because the use of imperative programming languages in the  introductory courses is common across the country, it is believed  that the curricular changes incorporated herein wil l serve as a  model for changes at other institutions. The results of the project  will be widely disseminated through workshops, conference  presentations and publications.  ***",
