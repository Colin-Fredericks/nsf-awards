 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306387  Lu       The project will focus on several mathematical problems  related to the unique continuation property of partial  differential equations.  This research is concerned with the  question of whether solutions of certain types of differential  equations can be equal to zero on an open set without being zero  everywhere. Here, the concern is whether recent improvements on  the classical Carleman method will produce a weak unique  continuation property of differential inequalities for small weak  norm on the potentials.  A second line of investigation  concerns weighted and nonweighted Sobolev interpolation  inequalities for vector fields. Inequalities of the  Poincare-Sobolev type for vector fields abound, but nothing much  has been done in the direction of interpolation inequalities.   Work will also be done weighted restriction results for the  Fourier transform with weights in the Fefferman-Phong class and  an effort will be made to obtain a sharp covering lemma in  n-dimensional Euclidean space refining earlier results of Stein  and Stromberg.       The combination of harmonic analysis and inequalities is  used to provide precise background information for  practitioners in partial differential equations.  The  inequalities developed give essential a priori information about  solutions as well as important estimates of their growth  properties.  ***",
