 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER award will support the parallel implementation of the                 immersed boundary method in the application of a three-                         dimensional heart model.  The immersed boundary method is a                     computational technique for the simulation of systems in which a                viscous incompressible fluid interacts with an immersed elastic                 boundary  Such systems are ubiquitous in biological fluid                       dynamics, and the immersed boundary method has already been                     applied to problems of blood flow in the cardiac chambers,                      platelet aggregation during blood clotting, aquatic animal                      locomotion, and wave propagation in the inner ear.  Current                     implementation of the immersed boundary method are fully                        vectorized on Cray computers, but only a single processor is used               although several are available.  The aim of  the proposed                       research is to create a parallel implementation which maintains                 full vectorization while making effective use of all available                  processors.  This work will be done on the Cray C-90 Computer, a                16-processor machine which is scheduled to arrive at the                        Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center this fall.  The scientific                     utility of the immerse boundary method will be enormously                       enhanced by the anticipated speedup resulting from                              parallelization.",
