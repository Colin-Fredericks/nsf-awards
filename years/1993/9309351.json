 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computing Research is a very young research area.  In the                  past few years it has become clear that computation is joining                  experimentation and mathematical analysis, providing a basic new                scientific paradigm for how science gets done.  In such a new and               rapidly changing field, communication among researchers is                      particularly important.  However, the conference structure in                   computer science and engineering is highly fragmented and works                 against such communication.  Important new research results are                 seldom presented at broad based national meetings.  Consequently,               broad based meetings are seldom attended by active researchers.                                                                                                 The Federated Computing Research Conference will address this                   problem.  This conference will retain the advantages of smaller                 specialized meetings while at the same time facilitating                        communication among researchers in different subfields.                         Additional benefits of this meeting include:  (1) economies of                  scale, (2) providing an educational function for the public, (3)                stimulating new research.",
