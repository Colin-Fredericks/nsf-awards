 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research supported by this award will focus on various                     aspects of nonlinear evolution equations: nonlinear partial                     differential equations whose solutions evolve in time.  The work                combines classical theory of differential equations with harmonic               analysis and mathematical physics.  The principal areas of study                include nonlinear dispersive systems arising as approximate                     models in propagation of nonlinear waves.  Particular interest                  will be paid to determining the lower bound of Sobolev exponents                which guarantee local well-posedness for the                                    generalized Korteweg-deVries equation.  A similar effort will be                applied to the study of nonlinear Schrodinger equations.  In both               cases preliminary work has already improved known estimates on                  the exponents. Higher order equations will also be analyzed.                    Here the nonlinear part of the equations will be restricted to                  polynomials having no constant term.  This class of evolution                   equation models waves in elastic media. Local results have                      already been established for the smoothness of solutions, but                   long-time behavior is not well understood.  For instance, fifth                 order systems do not have solitary wave solutions. Additional                   work is planned on the Zakharov-Schulman systems which describe                 interactions of small-amplitude, high frequencey wave with                      acoustic type waves. Where the linear part is elliptic, the                     equations have been extensively studied, otherwise no results are               known.     Partial differential equations form a basis for                      mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of                       mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as                 it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about                 the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                     uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                 develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on                the accuracy of these approximations.",
