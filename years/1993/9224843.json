This                                  activity is jointly sponsored by the American                                   Mathematical Society, with Dr. James W. Maxwell                                 as organizer,  and the Societe Mathematique de                                  France.  The School will present recent                                         progress in non-commutative geometry, infinite                                  dimensional geometry and operator algebras,                                     with applications to quantum statistical                                        mechanics and quantum field theory.  About 15                                   graduate students and recent doctorates from                                    Latin America and U.S. will participate.                                                                                                                        The subject of the conference is timely and of                                  great interest; the topics covered are                                          extremely important and the lecturers are of                                    the highest international calibre in their                                      fields.  This exposure to high level                                            mathematics will give the young and emerging                                    scientists valuable added professional training                                 and the opportunity to interact with eminent                                    mathematicians and physicists.",
