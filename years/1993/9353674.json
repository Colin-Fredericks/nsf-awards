 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory study will investigate ways to document                        what children learn from their participation in local                           science fairs.  Students' understanding of the process and                      elements that make up a science fair project as well as                         direct learning of science content related to their science                     fair topic will be evaluated though several different                           methodologies.  Comparative analysis will be made of                            indicators of children's learning yielded by these different                    approaches.  This study will be conducted in fourth and                         fifth grade classrooms in both an urban and a suburban                          school district.  From 75 to 100 students at each grade                         level will participate in the study.  The sample will be                        balanced with equal numbers of boys and girls.                                                                                                                  The project is significant because it will utilize a variety of                 assessment strategies to assess what children have learned                      from participation in a local science fair including who benefits               most.  The project should also begin to describe the student who                benefits most from science fair participation.  The assessment                  strategies are more informative to the instructional and evaluative             decisions that teachers must make regarding science learning and                assessment for upper elementary school students.",
