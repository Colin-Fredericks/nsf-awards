 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220005  Tullis         This work is a laboratory experimental study of the frictional  behavior of rocks with significance both for understanding  fundamental frictional processes and for learning how to apply the  laboratory results to faults in the Earth's crust that produce  earthquakes.  The focus is on two important problems.  The first  is to understand the processes responsible for the observed  behavior, so that constitutive equations can be based on known  processes.  This is important for extrapolating laboratory results  over large time and distance scales to earthquakes.  The second  problem is to understand the reason for differences in large  displacement experiments between velocity weakening behavior of  friction samples using initially bare surfaces and velocity  strengthening behavior of samples using simulated gouge.   Understanding the correlations between frictional behavior and  structures in these samples will help ascertain what behavior may  be associated with structures observed in natural faults.   Experiments will be conducted using a unique high pressure rotary  shear apparatus well suited for this purpose.  Experiments will be  done on rock types of geological importance with known flow and  fracture properties.  Pore fluid chemistry, sliding rate and  temperature will be varied to determine how frictional behavior  depends on these variables and to help identify operative  processes.  ***",
