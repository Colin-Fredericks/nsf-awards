The goal of the research                                   is to understand the biological function of DNA                                 methyltransferases and DNA restriction enzymes                                  coded by viruses which infect eukaryotic alga.                                  Algal viruses are icosahedral DNA containing                                    viruses which infect chlorella cells.                                           Specifically, the research will attempt to                                      establish a transformation system in chlorella                                  so that studies of algal viral genes can be                                     undertaken.                                                                                                                                                     Work to develop the transformation system is to                                 be carried out in Australia at the Australian                                   National University in Canberra. Once                                           the transformation system is established, the                                   cloning of viral genes will be accomplished.                                    The facilities at the University of Nebraska                                    are recognized as a major center for studying                                   these viruses and the restriction modification                                  system they encode. The analysis of the                                         restriction modification genes, isolated by the                                 Australian investigators, will be done at the                                   University of Nebraska.",
