 "awd_abstract_narration": "The so-called rusts are an important group of obligately                   parasitic plant pathogenic fungi.  Wheat rusts are probably the                 best known because of their serious effects on crop yields.                     Although host plant specificity is a hallmark of the rusts, little              is known about the evolutionary patterns of host tracking and host              shifting.  This lack of understanding is caused by our rudimentary              knowledge of the evolutionary relationships, or phylogeny, of the               rusts, both among the rust species and genera and with related                  basidiomycetes.  Dr. Thomas Bruns of the University of California-              Berkeley will use molecular genomic techniques to investigate                   evolutionary relationships at several taxonomic levels among the                rust fungi.  At the broadest level, DNA nucleotide sequences of the             ribosomal genes will be analyzed and mutational differences will be             compared among the major groups of rusts and their putative fungal              relatives.  At lower taxonomic levels, evolutionary relationships               among species of two genera, Cronartium and Melampsora, that are                important pathogens on pine trees will be investigated by DNA                   sequencing methods.  Patterns of relationship among the rust fungi              will be compared with patterns of relationship among pine species               to detect lineages where hostplant shifts have occurred.  Results               from this work should provide a better understanding of host                    tracking and host shifting in obligate plant pathogens, and will                also develop the database and methodology needed to facilitate                  rapid identification of species within the two selected genera.",
