 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301915  Flusberg       With the increase in atmospheric pollution and a new, growing  public awareness of resulting environmental damage, there is a need  for new technology to measure the concentration of trace species in  the atmosphere.  Extractive methods, in which a sealed sample of  air is analyzed in a laboratory, are expensive and are inapplicable  to continuous, in situ monitoring of concentrations.  Science  Research Laboratory (SRL) will develop an instrument called a laser  interferometric absorptiometer (LIA) to fill this need.  The basis  of this instrument is the interferometric measurement of the  optical-path change that occurs immediately after a pulsed laser  beam is absorbed by trace species present in one arm of the  interferometer.  This novel approach will lead to a breakthrough in  the technology of monitoring trace gases.  It will allow rapid in  situ measurements of trace-gas concentrations to be made for the  first time at parts-per-trillion (ppt) levels, 100-1000 times more  sensitively than instruments based on other approaches to monitor  trace species in the field.  In Phase I the characteristics of a  LIA were determined, and an LIA suitable for ppt trace-gas  measurements was designed.  IN Phase II, SRL will experimentally  research and demonstrate rapid ppt detection of several trace gases  including chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), major pollutants that are  responsible for depletion of the ozone layer and are considered  significant contributors to global warming.  In a privately funded  Phase III follow-on program, SRL will develop a commercial  instrument capable of measuring industrial emissions of CFCs and  other pollutants.",
