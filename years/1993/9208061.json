 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with research in theoretical,                    computational and applied aspects of a class of partial                         differential equations, known as nonhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann                  equations. Fast, accurate and parallelizable algorithms for                     solving these equations in simple and complicated regions will be               developed. Basic computational modules based on the theory of                   these algorithms will developed and implemented on serial and                   parallel computers. Emphasis will be placed on the use of vector                computers such as CRAY-YMP as well as parallel machines such as                 SEQUENT and NCUBE. These algorithms will be used to solve                       compressible flow problems and to generate quasiconformal                       mappings.                                                                            The theory of these algorithms makes use of analysis based                 on complex variables. This makes these algorithms elegant and the               computational procedure semianalytical. Beside, these algorithms                are extremely fast, highly accurate, easy to implement, and                     parallelizable.                                                                      The basic computational tools based on these algorithms will               be made user friendly and portable so that these can be applied                 with ease in many pure and applied areas including quasiconformal               mappings, fluid flows and inverse problems.",
