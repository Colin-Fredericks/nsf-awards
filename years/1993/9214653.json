 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental and theoretical bio-processing studies are                         directed toward the development of a molecular-thermodyamic                     model for separationg a target protein from a mixture of                        proteins in aqueuous solution.  Protein separation is achieved                  by precipitation induced by salts, nonionic polymers, or both.                  The resulting system consists of two liquid phases in                           equilbrium, with one enriched in the target protein.  A                         molecular-thermosynamic model is outlined for describing                        protein-precipitation phase equilibria.  This model is derived                  from an understanding of the intermolecular forces in the                       precipitating solutions; it uses the mean-spherical-                            approximation to define the reference system as a mixture of                    charged hard spheres.  Pertubations to this reference system                    result from the dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces and                     perhaps, specific association forces.  Osmotic pressures                        calculated from the model will be compared to osmotic-pressure                  data obtained from membrane osmometry and to osmotic second                     virial coefficients measured by low-angle laser-light                           scattering.  Experimental phase-equilibrium (precipitation)                     measurements will provide data against which the molecular-                     thermodynamic model can be compared.  Protein aggregate size                    distribution data from light scattering will be used to                         augment the theory when significant aggregation occurs.  The                    goal of this reech is to establish an engineering-oriented                      correlation for the rational design of protein-precipitation                    processes.  The long-range benefit of this research is that it                  is likely to provide useful knowledge for a better                              understanding of protein crystallization bioprocesses.",
