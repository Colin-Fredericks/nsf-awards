 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with nonlinear time series                       analysis.  It has four main objectives.  The first objective is                 to develop new methods for modeling nonlinear time series  via                  nonparametric smoothing techniques.  This research is a                         continuation of the work on functional coefficient AR models and                nonlinear additive AR models by the PI and Tsay over the last                   several years.  See Chen and Tsay (1993a, 1993b). The results                   obtained under this research will increase the applicability of                 nonlinear time series models.                                                        The second objective of the proposed research is to                        investigate binary-process driven switching regression models.                  A unified treatment is proposed for the general switching                       structures and a testing procedure is introduced for                            discriminating a random (independent) switching regression model                from a Markov-chain driven model.  The third objective is to                    study new approaches in finding the indicator variable for an                   open-loop threshold AR model.  Several approaches are suggested                 to overcome the difficulties encountered in using the open-loop                 threshold AR models.  In particular, two algorithms and some                    graphical tools are proposed to identify an appropriate indicator               variable.  The final objective is to investigate the ergodicity                 conditions of some nonlinear time series models.  The results                   obtained will provide a better understanding of the nonlinear                   models as well as a foundation on which asymptotic properties of                various nonparametric statistics for nonlinear time series                      analysis can be established.",
