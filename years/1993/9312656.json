The workshop will bring together ten  Hungarian scientists and engineers with ten from the United States to define an agenda for  future, long-term cooperative research that will address environmental problems.  Efforts of  the participants will directed toward those pollution problems which may be defined as  chemical reactions, governed by fundamental molecular interactions.  The goal of this  workshop is to stimulate new cooperative research that bears upon the fundamental issues  affecting environmental problems.  The research agenda to be formulated during the meeting  will draw upon multiple disciplines in chemistry and examine problems from the theoretical,  computational and experimental perspectives.    While the workshop will be organized by the United States and Hungary, other participants  from France, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland will  participate.  The intent is to involve chemists throughout the region in early stages of  planning cooperative research with the hope of strengthening professional ties that cross  national boundaries.  Results of the workshop should include new competitive, proposals for  joint research in environmental chemistry and an invigorated, better coordinated multi-  national approach to examining chemical solutions to basic environmental problems.",
