 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on how the chromosomes of a fungus, Nectria              haematococca, are separated during mitosis.  Previously, the time-              course and ultrastructural details of mitosis were determined and               the presence of pulling forces in the asters and pushing forces in              the spindle was demonstrated, both of which contribute to                       chromosome separation during anaphase B.  The present objectives                are to determine how these mitotic forces are generated.  To do                 this, advanced technologies of cytology and molecular biology will              be combined to examine the role of kinesin-like, microtubule-                   associated motor proteins (KLPs) in mitosis.  The strategy is to                clone as many KLP-encoding genes from an N. haematococca genomic                DNA library as possible, localize the gene products in the mitotic              apparatus in situ using immunofluorescence microscopy, determine                the polarity of force produced by each gene product in an in vitro              motility assay and then disrupt each of these genes in the genome               by site-specific mutation.  The effect of each mutation on                      progression through mitosis will be observed in vivo by video                   microscopy.  For each gene, the hypothesis that (1) elimination of              the KLP blocks or inhibits mitosis, and (2) overproduction of the               KLP increases the rate of mitotic movements will be tested.  Laser              microbeam experiments will then be used as a confirmation of the                suspected roles of the KLPs in mitotic force generation.                        %%%                                                                             The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is a complex system of structural,                  chemomechanical (motor), and regulatory proteins which serve as                 both an internal scaffolding for cells and as the machinery for                 virtually all cellular and intracellular movement, including the                movement of chromosomes at the time of cell division (mitosis).                 This work represents a unique opportunity to correlate specific                 motor proteins with in vivo-demonstrated mitotic forces of known                polarity (i.e., the pushing and pulling forces that result in                   chromosome movements).  The strategy of testing functional                      inferences by performing laser microbeam experiments on KLP-                    deficient mutants is unique and should lead to unequivocal                      conclusions as to which KLP is responsible for which mitotic force.             Thus, the work has the potential to be the first to fully elucidate             the molecular basis of both the astral pulling force and the                    spindle pushing force during anaphase B.  In doing so, it would                 contribute substantially to our understanding of the mechanisms of              microtubule-mediated movement of chromosomes during mitosis.  In                addition, it will add substantially to the information base needed              in order to exploit biological motors as novel biomolecular                     materials for bio(nano)fabrication and biomimetic reverse                       engineering.",
