The FORTE series of  conferences concentrates on formal techniques applicable to  distributed systems and protocols.  Initially the focus was  on the techniques standardized by ISO and CCITT (Estelle,  LOTOS, and SDI), but the scope has widened  considerably,  and recent FORTE conferences have also included papers on  CCS, CSP, ANS, 1 , Z, Actor, VDM, RAISE, and other  techniques.  In addition to a strong theoretical component,  FORTE, has always included a practical component,  attracting, practitioners in the field by actively  soliciting papers from industry and including demonstrations  of electronic tools for manipulating formal descriptions of  systems.  Much of the importance of these formal techniques  is the contribution that their use can make in  improving  the software of distributed systems.       The conference provides a forum for presentation of the  state of the art in theory, application, tools and  industrialization of formal techniques and provides an  excellent orientation for newcomers.       By bringing together both researchers and  practitioners, FORTE conferences open communications between  these groups.  This helps keep the research vital and  improves the state of the practitioner's art.  By  facilitating the participation of graduate students, the NSF  broadens the experience of the students and helps assure  growth in the United States in this important research area.",
