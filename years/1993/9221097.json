 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout much of the past three hundred years the                        settlement of New England has resulted in the destruction and                   fragmentation of native forest vegetation. Recently, there has                  been an increase in forest regeneration in this region. This                    study is designed to gather field data from a variety of sites                  that will be used to parameterize a model of forest development                 based on actual starting conditions measured in the field. Forest               dynamics is a function of seed dispersal, seedling establishment,               and differential growth rates of component species. In this study               field experiments will be conducted in a range of forest habitats               to determine the role of seed dispersal and herbivory in                        effecting forest regeneration. The results from these experiments               will be used to adjust and improve the forest dynamics model                    called SORTIE.  Models such as SORTIE provide baseline data under               known conditions against which it will be possible to compare                   actual patterns of forest regeneration. The mechanisms associated               with the model will dramatically increase our ability to predict                changes in forest vegetation. The ability to predict changes will               have important implications for global climate change and its                   effects on future biodiversity.                                                 %%%                                                                             Previous approaches to modelling forest dynamics have relied                    exclusively on average response variables and average                           environmental conditions. The SORTIE model represents a vast                    improvement over earlier models because it is truly spatially                   explicit. Initial conditions will be derived from positions of                  individual trees and saplings measured in the field. In addition,               the actual environmental conditions in different stands will be                 measured and incorporated into the model. The role of herbivores                in forest regeneration is being measured and added to the model.                Finally, this model represents an advance because it incorporates               environmental heterogeneity.",
