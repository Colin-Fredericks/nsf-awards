 "awd_abstract_narration": "Courses Scanning tunneling microscope technology (STM) is                       being used as a unifying project in our introductory                            electronics course and as a bridge to our laboratory course in                  materials characterization techniques.  By having the students                  build an STM and the compare their homebuilt version with a                     commercial unit, we address two major problems endemic to                       electronics courses:  the failure to truly interest students in                 the wide range of circuit techniques presented and the lack of                  student exposure to the full scope of a complex design project.                 We have chosen the STM because of its intuitive appeal and                      range of applications engage our students who come from a                       variety of scientific backgrounds.  We are building 13 scanning                 tunneling microscope workstations, each consisting of several                   separate circuit modules.  In weekly laboratory sessions                        students breadboard and study the circuits in each module, then                 interconnect previously built units to make a working STM.  The                 classroom lectures use the performance requirements of the STM                  project as a guide to exploring component and circuit                           specifications.  We have purchased a commercial instructional                   STM which the students use after they have demonstrated their                   homebuilt version.  They gain an appreciation of the results of                 the development efforts of an expert team and come to                           understand that a complex instrument is composed of simpler                     subunits.  Most students who take the electronics course                        subsequently take the materials characterization laboratory                     course.  They study the physics of scanning tunneling                           microscopy in experiments using the commercial STM, which                       complements present experiments in x-ray diffraction and                        scanning electron microscopy.  This is excellent preparation                    for independent research projects with active graduate research                 programs in scanning probe microscopies.  Students pursuing                     these courses have thorough knowledge of a state-of-the-art                     instrument and technique which gives them confidence to master                  any technology they will encounter in the future.",
