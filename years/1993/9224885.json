 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine the relationship between mother's                     schooling and child rearing styles in Mitontic, a rapidly                       modernizing rural highland Maya community in Chiapas,                           Mexico.  In particular, researchers will examine the                            proposition that mother's schooling affects social identity,                    parental investment strategies, and conceptions of personal                     development and interpersonal relations creating great                          differences in the environments infants experience.  This                       project  will provide a detailed account of early individual                    development in a sample of 25 Mayan infants and explore                         their mother's child care style as a function of                                sociocultural conditions (especially mother's schooling and                     cultural conceptions of child rearing) and a child's                            individual characteristics (e.g., gender, health, and birth                     order).  In addition to intensive ethnographic research on                      child rearing practices in Mitontic, mother-infant                              interaction will be videotaped on a bimonthly schedule and                      biweekly interviews with the mothers will be conducted from                     birth onwards in a longitudinal study of the first two years                    of life.",
