 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics at the University of Hawaii will purchase computer  equipment and software which will be dedicated to the support of research in the  mathematical sciences.  The equipment will be used for several research projects,  including in particular:  Differentiation and the Distribution of Zeros of  Functions; Lattice Theory; Learning, Generalization and Model Construction in  First-Order Logic; and Symbolic and Numerical Analysis of Ordinary and Partial  Differential Equations.  The first project is concerned with the effect of differentiation of the  distribution of zeros of polynomials and certain other functions.  New techniques  involving geometric mapping properties will be employed to study several well--  known conjectures.  The second project will use recent advances in free and  finitely presented lattices to study unsolved problems in lattice theory,  including solving equations in free lattices and finding the covers of finitely  generated lattice varieties.  The third project will study various aspects of  mechanical theorem proving.  The fourth project will search for normal forms and  natural geometric structures associated with control systems.",
