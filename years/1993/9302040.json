 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302040  Crimp       It is proposed to purchase a field emission gun scanning  electron microscope (FEG SEM) equipped with digital image  processing which will be dedicated to support research in materials  engineering.  This equipment will be fitted with a electron  channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) imaging system currently being  constructed in conjunction with a National Science Foundation Young  Investigator Award.  The FEG-SEM equipped with the ECCI system,  which will be the first facility of its type in the United States,  will be used for several research projects which require  microcrystalline analysis, but are not possible with conventional  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in particular:   Intrinsically brittle materials, including intermetallic alloys  will be examined using bulk samples deformed in-situ to determine  the nature of the dislocation generation and motion at and near the  crack tip zone.  Other research programs will also use the ECCI  capability for a wide range of materials investigations including  microstructure morphologies in polymer matrix composites,  interfacial characterization of intermetallic matrix composites and  compliant layer coatings, and damage accumulation studies at  fracture surfaces.  Additionally, the FEG SEM has advantages over  conventional W and LaB6 electron source SEMs, such as greater  resolutions (1.5 nm) and the ability to examine non-conducting  materials at low voltages without the need to apply a conductive  coating.  Numerous researchers throughout the Department of  Materials Science and Mechanics, and Michigan State University will  use these advantages to enhance their materials research.  ***",
