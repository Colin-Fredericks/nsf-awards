 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fine, ultrapure, uniform, loosely agglomerated particles are                    desirable starting materials for advanced ceramics.  Mixtures of                silicon nitride and silicon carbide are particularly valuable.  In              this program, the use of silane/acetylene/ammonia flames to produce             silicon nitride/silicon carbide powders will be studied. Specific               tasks include: (1) Experimental determination of flame stability                limits on a flat-flame burner for selected mixtures of silane,                  ammonia, and acetylene as a function of unburned gas velocity;                  (2) Thermodynamic determination of expected flame temperatures and              product yields as functions of input compositions, pressure, and                initial temperature; (3) Determination of the effects of operating              conditions on the properties of the powder produced, specifically               what operating conditions devermine whether the individual                      particles are a mixture of the carbide and nitride or whether the               nitride and carbide are in separate particles; (4) Determination                of the product properties (chemical composition, purity, particle               size distribution, morphology); and (5) Interpretation of the                   results in terms of mechanisms and commercialization potential.                                                                                                 High quality ultrafine silicon nitride/silicon carbide powders have             a large potential market in the preparation of advanced ceramic                 materials via sintering or hot pressing.  Progress in production                of advanced ceramics is currently limited by the unavailability of              a US-made high quality powder.  In addition, an understanding of                the mechanisms involved in this process will have broad                         implications for combustion synthesis (especially of mixed                      materials) in general.",
