 "awd_abstract_narration": "The teaching of animal physiology is being modernized and                       undergraduate research capabilities improved by adding six                      highly versatile, inexpensive microcomputer data acquisition                    stations and physiological instruments which interface with the                 microcomputers.  The physiology stations provide several                        curricular improvements, which include: 1) adding new                           experiments; 2) students learning modern data acquisition                       techniques; 3) the microcomputer, interfaced to an overhead                     projector, used as a classroom teaching aid; 4) students                        gaining a better understanding of the scientific method because                 they spend more time designing and performing experiments; and                  5) more undergraduates undertaking individual research                          projects.  The following instruments have been acquired for                     this purpose: Macintosh LC microcomputers, printers, data                       acquisition hardware and software (BIOPAC's Acknowledge),                       transducers, amplifiers, stimulators, equipment for a                           microelectrode station and an epithelial voltage clamp.  The                    new experiments include: 1) membrane and synaptic physiology of                 frog neuromuscular junction; 2) physiology and pharmacology                     studies of smooth muscle in crayfish hindgut; 3) membrane                       physiology of clam heart, employing the sucrose gap technique;                  4) neurosensory physiology of cockroach leg nerve; 5) mechanism                 of Na+ transport across voltage-clamped frog skin; and 6)                       cardiovascular physiology stimulated with Cardiovascular                        Function Lab (CFL).  CFL accompanies actual blood pressure                      measurements made in anaesthetized rats.",
