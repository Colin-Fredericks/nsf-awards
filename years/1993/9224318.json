 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224318  Robert Kuntz    This is an investigation of the influence structure and bonding of  molybdenum-sulfur complexes on the efficiency and mechanism of the  photocatalytic reduction of acetylene or water.  The electrons for  these reductions come from band-gap irradiation of small-particle  titania suspensions which serve as a \"support\" for the molybdenum   complexes.  Specific catalysts studied include monomeric and  dimeric forms of molybdenum(V) and molybdenum(VI) with ligands  containing sulfur and/or oxygen.  An objective is the  identification of the species exhibiting high efficiency for  trapping conduction-band electrons and catalyzing reduction of  small molecules.  Isotherms for adsorption and structures of  adsorbed species are investigated for various molybdenum-sulfur  solution species using ultraviolet and Raman spectroscopies; the  studies are done in solution or on solid surfaces in contact with  solution.  Similar studies are done after irradiation, including  the examination of substrates and the determination of the  oxidation state of the catalyst by chemical methods.    The use of light-driven catalysts (photocatalysis) offers the  potential to convert abundant and inexpensive materials to useful  products.  Better understanding to improve efficiency is needed,  but these processes offer relatively cheap routes to some valuable  products.  They will also reduce fossil fuel consumption  (especially when solar radiation can be used) and be  environmentally benign.",
