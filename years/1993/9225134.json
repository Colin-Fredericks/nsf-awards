 "awd_abstract_narration": "9225134  Osgood    Investigations of fundamental surface-chemical mechanisms  important in light-enhanced MOCVD (or MOMBE) epitaxy of specific  II-VI compound semiconductors will be conducted.  The research  will utilize time-of-flight mass spectroscopy and  total-internal-reflection infrared spectroscopy as well as a  variety of standard UHV surface probes to determine the  as-yet-unknown mechanisms for photo-induced reactions on II-VI  surfaces.  In addition, reaction cross-sections, yields, and  products will be measured, and in the course of these  measurements, consideration will be given to techniques for  proper preparation of atomically clean surfaces.  The primary  surfaces for study will be those on ZnSe and CdTe.  The study is  expected to give insight into the processes initiating reactions  and to guide selection of light-source wavelengths, precursor  molecules, and general growth conditions for epitaxy of II-VI  materials.  %%%  This research is expected to provide deeper fundamental  understanding of photo-assisted chemistry on surfaces and its  relation to photo-assisted epitaxy of compound semiconductor  materials. From an application point of view, the results will  provide guidance for the use of lasers and other light sources to  do patterning in an MOCVD epitaxy chamber, and will be important  to the general advancement in the technology of II-VI  optoelectronics leading to improvements in the performance of  advanced devices and integrated circuits used in computing,  information processing, and telecommunications.  ***",
