 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Meinke has isolated over 200 embryonic mutants of Arabidopsis                thaliana with a wide range of developmental abnormalities. He has               been mapping genes with essential functions during embryogenesis                and an analyzing of T-DNA insertional mutants produced following                seed transformation. The proposed research will continue a                      molecular analysis of tagged embryonic mutants and examine                      several untagged mutants with particularly unusual phenotypes.                  The molecular analysis will focus on four mutants in which                      flanking sequences have already been recovered. Detailed analysis               will be limited to mutant genes with interesting patterns of                    expression, sequence homology to known genes, or transcripts that               can be recovered from existing cDNA libraries. Dr. Meinke has                   recently identified a novel homeotic mutant that appears to be                  defective in a regulatory gene that functions to activate a wide                range of embryo specific pathways. Mutant embryos are abnormal,                 occasionally viviparous, and desiccation intolerant, but can be                 rescued in culture prior to desiccation. The resulting seedlings                have a phenotype consistent with a model that mutant cotyledons                 are partially transformed into leaves, and that this regulatory                 gene functions to maintain the distinction between leaves and                   cotyledons. This mutant is not tagged, but merits detailed                      analysis and Dr. Meinke proposes to map the gene in preparation                 to further characterization of this interesting mutant.",
