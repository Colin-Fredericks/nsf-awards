 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal provides for the enhancement of content                           knowledge and pedagogical skills of under-prepared teachers                     of physical science.  Participants will include 24 high                         school teachers of physical science in Texas.  The program                      will utilize the instruction of a team of experienced,                          highly successful high school physical science teachers who                     are officers of TTOPS (Texas Teachers Organization for                          Physical Science) in conjunction with a pair of university                      professors in physics and chemistry.                                                                                                                            The project includes three components.  These components                        focus on a two-week series of summer institute workshops on                     the basic concepts taught in the high school physical                           science courses; a series of follow-up workshops during the                     academic year on supplementary topics; and visits to the                        school and classroom of the participants to provide                             assistance with the implementation, evaluation of the                           program and reinforcement.                                                                                                                                      Cost sharing is equivalent to 25% of the NSF award.",
