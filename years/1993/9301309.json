Experimentally, emphasis will be placed on  the soft x-ray standing wave (XSW) technique performed in  conjunction with surface extended x-ray adsorption fine structure  (SEXAFS).  This will be followed with scanning tunneling microscopy  (STM) to aid in the final structural determination.  XSW provides  the perpendicular distances between the substrate planes and the  overlayer, while SEXAFS allows precise bond length determinations.   Together these techniques can determine adsorption angles and hence  interfacial geometries of complex metal-semiconductor systems.  In  combination with STM, these techniques form a very complimentary  set of probes for the complete structural determination at an  interface.  The main goals of this proposal are to achieve an in-  depth understanding of the interfacial atomic structure alkali  metal overlayers and to correlate the information with their  electronic properties.  In addition, this structural and electronic  information will test and further develop state-of-the-art  theoretical calculations.  %%%  Novel electronic properties of interfaces have enormous commercial  applications in electronics.  The simplest such interface, used as  a building block of most practical devices, is a junction between  a metal and a semiconductor.  In this proposal, the microscopic  (atomic) structure of single layers of alkali metals (such as  sodium, potassium) deposited on silicon and germanium will be  studied.  These layers display a unique ability to substantially  lower the potential barrier for election escape from the  semiconductor and, because of that, are used in infrared detectors  and photocathodes.  This investigation will use several techniques  based on synchrotron radiation.  In particular, a newly developed  standing wave method which allows precise location of foreign atoms  on surfa ces will be utilized.  The results will be of fundamental  interest and have potential to aid development of new materials for  technological applications.  ***",
