Using 13 years of longitudinal data, the research will first                    involve statistical analysis of the transitions between part-                   timework, full-time work, and spells of non-labor force                         participation.  The patterns of life cycle labor force                          involvement that occur over time will be analyzed.  Second, the                 project will analyze spells of part-time and full-time work as                  well as spells when a woman is not in the labor force, utilizing                state-of-the-art duration analysis techniques.  Of particular                   interest are the causal reasons behind the beginning and the                    ending of part-time labor market spells, and the relationship                   between labor market transitions in and out of part-time work and               other demographic and economic changes within a woman's                         household.  The results of this research will increase our                      understanding of life-cycle labor market decision-making, the                   role of part-time work in the labor market, and the labor supply                decisions of adult women.  It should also provide insight into                  the extent to which policy-makers can rely on encouraging low-                  skilled women to enter part-time jobs as a route toward full-time               employment.",
