 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302247  Stacey       Habitat fragmentation is one of the most serious factors  threatening the preservation of biological diversity.  As a result  of human development, once continuous landscapes such as forests  and wetlands have been altered and divided into small patches. This  reduces population sizes of the plants and animals within each  patch, and may make them more vulnerable to extinction.  In this  project, researchers will test predictions of the metapopulation  model of Stacey and Taper.  They will study the federally listed  Mexican Spotted Owl in New Mexico, and owl whose survival has been  threatened by logging and other changes to its habitat.  They  hypothesize that small and naturally fragmented populations of this  owl are united by dispersal, and that immigration form one  population can \"rescue\" other populations from extinction.  Both  field observations and several new molecular genetic techniques  will be used to measure dispersal of juveniles and adults among  four adjacent but isolated mountain ranges.  %%%  This Study will provide important new information on the role of  dispersal and metapopulation structure in the persistence of rare  species in arid environments, and new data needed by land  management agencies for the development of successful management  plans for the conservation of the Mexican Spotted Owl itself.  ***",
