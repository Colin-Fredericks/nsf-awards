 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project targets 42 schools in two school districts near                    the University of Alabama, Huntsville.  Each of the 42                          schools will have a leader/master teacher in grades K-1,                        grades 2-3, and grades 4-5 for a total of 126 leader/master                     teachers.  Participants will be selected on the basis of                        potential for leadership, dedication to science, willingness                    to help other teachers, and prior experience in teaching                        hands-on science.  The 2-year training plan includes 45 days                    of instruction per teacher from university science and                          education faculty.  The cadre of leader/master teachers will                    train all K-5 teachers in activity-inquiry teaching and join                    with the principal and school resource scientist in forming                     leadership teams to lead all elementary schools in                              implementing a curriculum using nationally developed and                        tested hands-on modules.  The two school districts are                          creating a materials management program to provide kits of                      STC or INSIGHTS materials for every classroom on a                              continuing basis.                                                                                                                                               This leadership proposal is appropriate for teacher                             enhancement because it is designed to enhance the science                       knowledge and teaching, and develop leadership skills and                       efforts of lead teachers of grades k-5, and because it is a                     systemic plan designed to improve science education in all                      elementary classrooms in the participating districts.                                                                                                           Non-NSF cost-sharing is approximately 47% of the amount                         requested from NSF.",
