 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precast concrete frames using beam elements connected to                        multi-story column elements with post-tensioned prestressing                    tendons has been identified as an economically viable method                    of construction for tall buildings.  Recent research has                        indicated that beam-column joint subassemblages using fully                     grouted tendons developed ductility comparable to monolithic                    reinforced concrete subassemblages designed to current                          specifications.  But the tendons often suffer excessive                         stiffness degradation at low displacements after moderate                       ductility levels had been chieved.  This was caused by a                        reduction of effective prestress clamping force through the                     column, resulting from inelastic strain of the prestressing                     tendon at the critical section.                                                                                                                                 This project conducts a pilot study to experimentally                           verify a new concept for connecting precast seismic frames                      using unbonded prestressing tendons.  The tendons will                          connect precast beam and column sections which allows a                         nonlinear elastic response and achieves a considerable                          displacement capacity.  This capacity is free from                              problems associated with permanent deformation, thus                            enable the joint shear capacity to be enhanced without the                      need for extensive joint shear reinforcement.                                                                                                                   Two large scale  test units representing an external and an                     internal connections respectively will be constructed and                       tested under cyclic lateral deformations using the existing                     pseudo-dynamic testing facility at University of                                California, San Diego.  Conservative transverse                                 reinforcement details will be chosen and heavily strain                         gauged.  It is expected that recommendations for reduced                        reinforcement will be made and verification of the concept                      will be achieved from the experimental research.
