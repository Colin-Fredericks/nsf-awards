 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently there is reasonably convincing support for the hypothesis             that reversible modification of proteins by ADP-ribosylation plays              a significant role in regulation of cellular functions and signal               transduction in eukaryotes.  The overall objective of this research             is to elucidate at the molecular level the role(s) of ADP-                      riblosyltransferases (ADPRTases) in signal transduction and                     regulation of cellular functions.  To achieve this goal, it will be             necessary to (1) understand how the activity of these enzymes is                regulated, (2) identify the proteins which serve as physiologically             relevant targets for this post-translational modification, and (3)              determine how the modification of these specific proteins controls              cellular functions.  Progress toward these goals is hampered by the             lack of immunological and molecular genetic reagents for studying               the modifying enzymes and target proteins involved in ADP-                      ribosylation reactions.  For example, no gene for an endogenous                 ADPRTase has yet been cloned or sequenced.  Likewise, no target                 protein for in vivo ADP-ribosylation has been identified.  One                  specific goal of this proposal is to generate immunological and                 molecular genetic reagents to use as probes in addressing some of               the important questions surrounding these post-translational                    modifications of proteins.  The parallel and complementary aims of              this study are (1) generation of antibodies that specifically                   recognize ADPRTases and ADP-ribosylated proteins and (2) molecular              analysis of these proteins and their genes.                                     %%%                                                                             Many proteins are structurally modified after synthesis by addition             of various small molecules.  In some cases these modifications have             been shown to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of action of the             protein.  For example, in many cellular responses to external                   stimuli the mechanism of signal transduction often involves the                 activation of an enzyme that adds or removes a phosphate group from             some protein.  Another type of protein modification is the addition             of a molecule, known as adenosine diphosphoribose, derived from a               vitamin and a sugar, to specific proteins.  This chemical reaction              is carried out by an enzyme known as adenosine diphosophoribosyl-               transferases (ADPRTases).  The overall goal of this research is to              elucidate at the molecular level the role(s) of ADP-                            ribosyltransferases in signal transduction and regulation of cell               functions.  The near term objectives are to characterize ADP                    ribosyltransferases and to identify and characterize the                        physiologically important protein substrates of the ADPRTases.                  First it is necessary to develop biochemical and immunological                  tools to proceed with these studies.  The results of this research              should be an important contribution to understanding of the                     molecular mechanisms by which cells respond to external stimuli.",
