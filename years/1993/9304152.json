It is aimed to resolve  existing discrepancies between theories and experiments.  Aerosol  charging and the subsequent manipulation of the particles in an  electric field are effective means of measuring, classifying and  collecting them.  The project will first focus on developing an  aerosol charger of low particle-loss, capable of operating under  vacuum and in high purity gases.  It will be followed by  experimental studies of aerosol charging by ions and free  electrons.  Aerosol charge distributions will be measured.  This  method of testing charging theories is more sensitive than the  traditional charged fraction measurement.  A numerical solution to  the Boltzmann collision equation will be obtained to compare with  the existing theories and with data obtained.    The results of this study should provide a better understanding of  fundamental transfer processes and the needed knowledge base  towards improving the collection efficiency of electrostatic  precipitations in the air pollution  control industry, measuring  and classifying nanometer  particles in the materials industry, and  controlling particulate contaminants in plasma reactors in the  microelectronics industry.  ***",
