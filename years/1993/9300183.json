Each summer, about 36 undergraduates from diverse collegiate                    and ethnic backgrounds will spend 10 weeks engaged in                           developmental biology research at the University.  Mentors                      will be selected by the students from about 40 faculty                          members who have active, well-funded research groups and who                    study developmental mechanisms in a wide range of                               experimental systems.  The emphasis will be on getting each                     student actively engaged in increasingly independent                            research in one of these productive research groups.                            However, to permit students to view their own research in a                     broader context, the program will provide five types of                         supplemental activities:  (i) workshops dealing with                            important model organisms, methods and paradigms in                             contemporary developmental biology research, (ii) faculty                       seminars designed specifically for the students, (iii)                          participation in the existing Developmental Biology Journal                     Club, (iv) a parallel journal club run by and for the                           students themselves and (v) an end-of-summer research                           retreat at which all students will present papers                               summarizing their research accomplishments.  Opportunities                      for frequent peer-group social interactions will also be                        provided.",
