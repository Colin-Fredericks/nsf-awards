 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308581  Crowe    Previous studies have shown that certain organisms that survive  complete dehydration (such as yeast cells, seeds) contain large  quantities of sugars, particularly trehalose or sucrose.  These  sugars preserve structure and function by replacing the water  around polar residues.  As a result, the membranes and proteins  are maintained in a physical state similar to that seen in the  fully hydrated preparations.    The same sugars also stabilize liposomes in the dry state.  As a  result of these findings, liposomes, which are in use for  clinical treatment of certain diseases, can be shipped as dry  powders.  Upon rehydration, they are ready for use.    Based on these previous findings, it has been suggested that  presence of one of these sugars is sufficient to preserve  structure and function in any cell upon drying. However, further  evidence has emerged that while cells that are not normally  adapted to drying can be induced to survive when the sugars are  introduced, they usually die soon thereafter.  This project is  aimed at discovering the mechanisms that destabilize such cells  and the means by which cells that are normally adapted to drying  escape that destabilization.  We expect the results not only to  be of scientific interest, but also to be useful in the  preservation of biological structure and function by drying or  freezing.  ***",
