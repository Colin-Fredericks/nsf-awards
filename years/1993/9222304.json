 "awd_abstract_narration": "This physical-biological modeling study of the interactions                     that control the exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean and               the atmosphere in the Southern Ocean is a joint effort between                  Columbia University and the University of Southern California.                  This component of the project concerns the physical and chemical                processes in the ocean that determine the fluxes of carbon dioxide.                                                                                             The Southern Ocean is of particular importance in this context                  because it represents one of the two global regions where deep                  convection allows the ventilation of upwelling water masses, and                where the sinking of surface waters removes unutilized nutrients                from the euphotic zone.  This area has a large range of physical,               chemical, and biological processes, so that the seasonal amplitude              of the carbon dioxide flux is also large, and makes individual                  observations poor estimators of the annual mean value.  In fact it              is currently not clear whether this region is one of net uptake or              release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.                                                                                                                    An existing one-dimensional model which describes the vertical                  air/sea/ice interactions and energy fluxes will be modified to                  include the effects of air-sea gas exchange and the relevant                    chemistry and carbon flow within the planktonic communities of the              upper ocean.  A series of experiments will be performed to                      determine the sensitivity of the model to parameterization schemes,             initial conditions, and boundary conditions.  Ultimately the model              will be coupled to a global circulation model developed by the                  Goddard Institute of Space Studies in order to answer such specific             questions as what are the factors that determine the general                    patterns of horizontal phytoplankton distribution as observed by                satellite-based color scanners; what is the relationship between                pigment distributions and rates of primary productivity; what                   fraction is new production exportable to the deep ocean, and what               is the magnitude of the biogenic flux of carbon dioxide in the deep             Southern Ocean.",
