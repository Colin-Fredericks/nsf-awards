The organizers                                    are Joseph Lambert of Northwestern University                                   and Norma Nudelman of the University of Buenos                                  Aires.                                                                                                                                                          The purpose of the workshop is to assess                                        priorities of research areas in the field of                                    physical organic chemistry and to enhance                                       collaboration among US and Latin American                                       scientists.  Support will cover travel expenses                                 for eight US scientists and three developing                                    country scientists (from Costa Rica, Uruguay,                                   and Colombia).  The workshop will emphasize                                     participation from throughout Latin America,                                    particularly of younger scientists, for whom                                    access to researchers and current information                                   in this field is critical.  Expected benefits                                   include the establishment of ties for future                                    international research collaboration, with                                      applications to the chemical industry that will                                 be both economic and scientific.",
