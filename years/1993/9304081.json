 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304081  Abello  This project is concerned with the problem of deciding if a  given graph is the visibility graph of a simple polygon on the  plane.  This problem is known to be in PSPACE but it is not  known to be NP-HARD.  In fact even proving membership in NP  appears to be non trivial.  A novel approach to studying  properties of visibility graphs of simple polygons is being  pursued based on the result that visibility graphs of simple  polygons can be derived in a purely combinatorial manner from  the representations of their underlying point configurations  by chains in the weak Bruhat order of the symmetric group.    One of the objectives is to obtain a characterization of  visibility graphs of simple polygons in terms of a class of  graphs derived from chains in the weak Bruhat order of the  symmetric group.  Such a characterization would prove  membership in NP and also provide a purely combinatorial  algorithm for the visibility graph recognition problem.  In  addition, the combinatorial and algorithmic relationships  between visibility graph recognition and fundamental problems  in Computational Synthetic geometry, such as oriented matroid  representation and circular sequence realization are being  explored.",
