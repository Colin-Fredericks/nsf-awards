 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313934  Andreou  This project will attempt to  develop a new class of recurrent  networks.  The architecture of the  networks is inspired by recent work  on image encoding based on iterated  transformation theory and it's  associated inverse problems.  The  PIs purpose to restrict our  investigation to networks that can  be physically implemented in  subthreshold analog VLSI.  With  their approach analog components  that implement high quality  arithmetic operations are  unnecessary.  Indeed, significant  departures from ideal linear  behavior can be tolerated, provided  that these departures are  reproducible across chips.  As a  concrete application they will  consider that task of data  compression and decompression.   Compression is accomplished by the  relaxation of an electronic circuit  to a steady state while compression  is preformed either off-line or  with an adaptive analog VLSI neural  network architecture.  For hardware  compression they propose to use a  learning algorithm that learns both  the weight and the connection  topology.  Hence, the ability to  gate and switch electrical current  is central to the operation of  these networks.  The main thrust of  this investigation is to design and  characterize the circuits that  implement the required  transformations in one dimension.   A successful outcome to this  investigation has the potential for  making compression and  decompression technology available  for all low-power applications.  ***",
