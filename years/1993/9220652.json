 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental question in biology is \"How do new species                   arises?\"  This project will investigate the genetic  basis of                   reproductive isolation in two species in the parasitic wasp genus               Nasonia.  Nasonia is a genetically tractable system with two                    important features, (a) symbiotic bacteria (Wolbachia) cause                    partial reproductive incompatibility between the species and (b)                genetic incompatibilities also occur between nuclear and                        cytoplasmic components, some of which show simple inheritance                   patterns.                                                                            The role of bacterial symbionts in causing reproductive                    incompatibility is one of interest because bacteria could represent             a mechanism for rapid speciation in insects.  This research is                  designed to assess the potential role of bacteria in promoting                  and/or maintaining reproductive isolation between the species.  The             distribution and degree of incompatibility within and between                   species will be quantified.  Experiments will determine the                     probability of interspecies hybridization in the presence or                    absence of the bacteria.  Using molecular markers, Dr. Werren will              also determine whether few or  many genes are involved in the                   genetic and cytoplasmic incompatibility between the two species.                     Results of these studies will help reveal the genetic                      mechanisms by which species diverge from each other and whether                 novel interactions, such as bacterial-insect associations, could                play a role in speciation.  Findings could have practical                       implications to conservation biology and preservation of biological             diversity.***",
