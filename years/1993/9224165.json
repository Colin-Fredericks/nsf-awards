 "awd_abstract_narration": "Enhanced Raman scattering methods will be used for in situ ultra-               high vacuum studies of clusters and ultra-thin films deposited on               surfaces.  Information about the phonon states and their changes                with cluster size and temperature will be obtained.  Emphasis will              be places on the semiconducting and semimetallic group IV (C and                Sn) and V (Bi and Sb) elements in amorphous or nanocrystalline                  states.  Raman scattering will also be applied to liquid clusters               from this group to obtain dynamical information on the phase                    transformations from the solid to liquid state.  Sputtering and                 laser assisted deposition methods will be employed for cluster and              ultra-thin film growth.  Photoemission and high resolution electron             energy loss methods will provide complementary information on                   changes in electronic and vibrational states and the role of atomic             hydrogen bonding on surfaces.                                                   %%%                                                                             This research will focus on both near surface and bulk properties               of ulrathin and thin films with different nanostructures.  Emphasis             will be placed on studies of semiconductor or semimetal cluster                 structures in which both the relatively small number of atoms and               the large surface to volume ratio allow modified material                       properties to be achieved.  Both solid as well as liquid state                  cluster properties will be explored.  The preparation of these                  materials will employ a diverse range of ultrahigh vacuum                       deposition methods, including magnetron sputtering, evaporation and             laser assisted deposition.  The physical properties and                         characterization of these materials will employ a range of in situ              ultrahigh vacuum spectroscopic methods.  This will provide                      information on the electronic state and vibrational dynamics of                 disordered amorphous and nanocrystalline solids and will explore                the role of bonding and structural disorder changes in the                      processing of ultrathin films.  Additional ex situ transmission                 electron microscopy studies of cluster size distributions will be               obtained and related to synthesis methods.  Laser assisted                      deposition of amorphous carbon and other diamond-like materials                 will involve university-industry collaborations.",
