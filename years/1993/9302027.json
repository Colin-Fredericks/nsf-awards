The main focus will be on modern homotopy theory.  The conference  will be accessible to graduate students and other young scientists  in this field.  Members of traditionally underrepresented groups  will be encouraged to attend.  It will represent an important  opportunity for all to meet with the leaders in the subject.  The  main topics will be two areas which have experienced spectacular  growth over the past few years: the chromatic perspective on stable  homotopy theory (the telescope conjecture, Picard groups,  axiomatics of structured ring spectra), and unstable homotopy  theory (localizations, finite loop spaces, loop spaces of finite  complexes, algebraic homotopy theory).       Topology concerns itself with aspects of geometric spaces and  structures which remain unchanged by continuous transformations.   Dimension, connectedness (being all in one piece), the properties  of being knotted or linked, and many more, all are subjects of  topological study, for they are preserved so long as cutting or  tearing are not permitted despite quite drastic alteration of shape  and size.  It is clear that these are fundamental and significant  properties but that their study requires different tools from those  of ordinary analytic geometry to make them manageable and a subject  for calculation.  Algebraic topology is devoted to developing,  understanding, and applying these tools, and homotopy is one of the  most powerful and complex tools in the arsenal.  ***",
