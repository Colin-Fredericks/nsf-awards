 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309667  BATCHELDER    This project will continue research on a class of formal cognitive  models known as general processing tree (GPT) models.  GPT models  are a special class of simple statistical models that have great  potential to help researchers measure unobservable cognitive  capacities, such as memory storage, memory organization, and  retrieval capacity.  Prior research involved the invention of a  number of new models and their application to different issues in  human memory, including bilingualism, eyewitness memory, mnemonics,  source memory, and memory loss in the elderly.  Also, advances in  the statistical theory behind this type of modeling have led to the  work beginning to have an impact on the basic research of a number  of psychologists.  The goal of this new project is to expand this  research program and take it to the \"next level.\"  This will  include the development of new GPT models and expansion of their  application to a wider range of topics in psychology.  For example,  one project will take current complex theories of human cognition  and represent them approximately with more simple GPT models.   Recent research suggests that the class of cognitive models that  can be represented in this manner is quite large.  When theoretical  models are expressed in GPT form, the extensive statistical theory  behind GPT modeling can provide a simple yet thorough method for  evaluating and understanding the models.  Another project will  explore the use of GPT models to measure different types of  logical-reasoning capacities, such as the ability to find  confirming and disconfirming evidence for a hypothesis.  The  research will develop GPT models to disentangle these and other  factors in reasoning.  The result should be a clearer idea of how  to assess a person's logical strengths and weaknesses.  In  addition, the research will include further analysis of the  statistical and structural properties of GPT models.  This analytic  work will include extending the models to han dle individual  differences in cognitive abilities and also expanding them to  analyze the time it takes to make various responses (i.e.,  reaction-time data).  Finally, a major goal of this project is to  develop and document user-friendly software programs on the use of  GPT models.  The material will be targeted to a large class of  research psychologists and will include a general overview of GPT  modeling, examples from inside and outside psychology, and the  statistical results from this research.  The computer programs will  be general enough to enable researchers to develop, analyze, and  test their own GPT models in a wide variety of situations.  These  materials will serve to make this methodology more accessible to  other psychologists.     ***",
