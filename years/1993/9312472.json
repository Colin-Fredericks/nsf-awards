 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312472  Bennett    Under the direction of Dr. Kenneth Bennett, Ms. Diane Holliday will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze human  skeletal materials excavated from the Classic Mimbres site of NAN  Ranch, which is located in southwestern New Mexico. The site was  occupied between ca. 1000 - 1150 AD. Ms. Holliday will use a series  of techniques to reconstruct the health status (when they were  alive) and diet of individuals who lived in two different areas of  the site to determine whether significant differences exist and  whether they can be explained on the basis of social status. To do  this she will conduct both osteological and chemical analyses. She  will examine the bones to determine subadult growth rates, adult  stature and the incidence of skeletal abnormalities which indicate  either malnutrition or disease. Both trace element and carbon  isotope analyses will then be conducted and these allow estimation  of relative amounts of meat and corn in the diet.    Prior to the arrival of Columbus in the New World, Native American  societies in the U.S. Southwest reached a chiefly level of  organization characterized by aggregates of people in towns  composed of large pueblos, some including several hundred rooms.  Anthropologists wish to understand both the processes which led to  this aggregation and the mechanisms which permitted these groups to  persist for hundreds of years. In many parts of the world, this  process was accompanied by the appearance of status differentiation  and the emergence of a stratified society with a chiefly form of  organization. However the Mimbres culture is interesting because,  from extant archaeological evidence at least, such status  differentiation is not apparent. Through use of skeletal analysis  and the application of chemical techniques Ms. Holliday will  examine this question.    This research is important for several reasons. It will increase  our understanding of how complex societies emerge. It will provide  new data on t he prehistory and achievements of Native Americans in  the U.S. Southwest. It will also contribute to the training of a  promising young scientist.  ***",
