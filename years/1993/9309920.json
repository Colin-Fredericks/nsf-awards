The research                                             will focus on the control of photosynthesis in                                  mangroves under natural conditions. Mangrove                                    forests of tropical coasts and estuaries are                                    highly productive and essential to the                                          maintenance of associated ecosystems.                                           Mangroves, noted for their exceptional                                          tolerance to high temperatures and light                                        intensity as well as salinity, are also a                                       notable exception to the rule that plants                                       found in demanding environments would grow                                      better in less demanding ones but are excluded                                  by competition.                                                                                                                                                 The research team will travel to the Daintree                                   River estuary in north Queensland where a                                       combination of biochemical and biophysical                                      approaches will be applied to the problem of                                    short term control of photosynthesis in                                         mangroves. Among the topics to be investigated                                  is the apparent lack of photoinhibitory                                         damage to leaves exposed to high light and high                                 temperatures for prolonged periods with their                                   stomates closed.",
