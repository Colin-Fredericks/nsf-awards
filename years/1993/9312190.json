 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312190  Bernstein  In this project of the Physical Chemistry Program in the  Chemistry Division, Prof. E. Bernstein of the Colorado State  University will study cold, isolated and solvated aromatic  carbene molecules created by laser photolysis and supersonic  jet cooling using several methods of laser spectroscopy.  These  include fluorescence excitation and dispersed emission  spectroscopies on the nanosecond time scale; mass resolved  excitation spectroscopy; picosecond correlated single photon  counting; and various picosecond time-resolved pump/probe  spectroscopies.  Similar work will also be done on clusters.  Complementary ab initio and semi-empirical calculations will be  used to assist in the interpretation of the experimental data.  %%%  Carbenes are radicals known to be important intermediates in  many condensed-phase chemical reactions.  To understand, and  ultimately be able to control such reactions, it is necessary to  know the properties of the participating carbene species.  Direct determination of some of their critical properties from  studies of the condensed phase is impractical and they are  therefore determined for the most part indirectly from kinetic  measurements.  This research serves to provide these properties  directly from measurements on gas phase carbene systems. The  compounds to be investigated should provide information on the  relationships between their geometrical structure, electronic  structure, and reactivity.  ***",
