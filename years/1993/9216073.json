 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Stuart Rice is supported by a grant from the                          Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to perform                      studies of elementary processes in chemical dynamics for the                    purpose of (i) improving the theory of laser control of product                 selectivity in a chemical reaction, and (ii) improving the                      theory of unimolecular reaction rates.  Existing theories of                    laser control of the evolution of a quantum system will be                      extended to the case of nonadiabatic reactions, and the theory                  will be improved by incorporation of a feedback mechanism that                  shapes the optimal laser field without precise knowledge of all                 of the molecular parameters in the system Hamiltonian.  The                     description of unimolecular reaction rates based on modern                      nonlinear mechanics will be improved by extension of the                        mapping methods which provide an exact representation of the                    dynamics of systems with two degrees of freedom to systems                      with many degrees of freedom. The results will be used to                       study several types of unimolecular fragmentation and                           isomerization reactions.  A quantum version of the classical                    theory of unimolecular reaction rates will also be                              developed.                                                                      %%%                                                                             The achievement of selective control of product formation in                    a reaction has been sought persistently throughout the                          evolution of chemistry.  To date, such control has only been                    accomplished at the macroscopic level, by the manipulation                      of external factors such as temperature, pressure, solvent                      character, etc.  With the advent of the tunable laser, it                       was hoped that product selectivity could be controlled at                       the microscopic level, and that individual bonds within a                       molecule could be selectively broken.  It was very quickly                      found that energy absorbed by a molecule was not easily                         localized in individual bonds, but preferred to redistribute                    throughout the molecule.  More recently, however, the                           concept of laser selective chemistry has had a rebirth, and                     theories developed by Rice and others have shown that energy                    could be localized by carefully choosing a complex sequence                     of laser pulses of prescribed shapes.  If this theory can be                    put to practice experimentally, it may still be possible to                     realize the goal of microscopic selective control of                            chemical reactions.",
