 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description:  This project supports participation by six                        scientists from South Asia and the Middle East in a NATO Advanced               Study Institute on \"Computer Modeling of Free-Surface and                       Pressurized Flows\".  The Institute is to be held at Washington                  State University in Pullman, WA, from June 28th to July 9th,                    1993.  Topics to be covered include: governing equations of free-               surface flows, and use of finite difference methods, turbulence                 models, modeling of three dimensional flows, modeling of flows                  with undular bores, modeling of sediment transport, flood routing               models, urban drainage models, governing equations of pressurized               flows and steady-flow in pipe networks, modeling of two-component               flows, modeling of water quality in pipe networks, modeling of                  slow transients and of rapid transients, and modeling of cooling                water systems.  Fourteen well-known authorities in the field will               present state-of-the-art lectures to be followed by discussions                 with the participants.  Most of the participants will have                      postgraduate degrees, and many could be considered as established               specialists.                                                                                                                                                    Scope:  The NATO Advanced Study Institute provides a well-planned               forum for presentation of recent advances in research and for                   interaction between the lecturers and the participants during a                 two-week period in a small university town setting.  This will                  provide excellent opportunities for exchange of information and                 for developing contacts for future cooperative research.  This                  project to support the participation of six scientists from                     countries outside NATO is in line with INT's objective of                       increasing interaction between U.S. scientists and those from                   developing countries, who have limited access to similar                        scientific meetings in the U.S.",
