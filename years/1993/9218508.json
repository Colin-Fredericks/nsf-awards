 "awd_abstract_narration": "High density (HD) bands mark annual cycles of growth in X-                 radiographs of reef coral skeletons and presumably form due to                  physiological response to seasonal cycles of temperature and light.             However, the mechanism of formation has not been established for                any coral.  The HD band is usually used to define the annual band,              and thus understanding its formation, and the controls on                       variability in its timing is important.  In the research, a                     conceptual model of how density bands form, based on physiological              and morphological data obtained with earlier NSF funding, is will               be developed.  Four specific aspects of the work will include:  (1)             development of a mechanistic mathematical model for the formation               of the HD band of Montastrea annularis, a major coral used in                   paleoclimate work; (2) conducting an in situ experiment to test the             validity of the model;  (3) evaluation of the genetic vs.                       environmental components of variation in time of formation of the               HD band; and (4) assessment of the variation among corals in the                relationship between HD bands and stable isotope profiles.  This                study will provide the type of environmental physiological data                 needed for the precise use of coral density bands for                           paleoclimatology.",
