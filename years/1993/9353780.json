 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353780  Wall    This proposal describes a summer internship program for 15 undergraduate women in the fields  of science, engineering or mathematics (SEM), recruited from Missouri's colleges and  universities.  The program is designed to interest and involve the interns in SEM research, and  to serve as a transition from undergraduate to graduate study by preparing the interns for  admission and successful matriculation in graduate SEM education programs.  SPWSEM'94 will  provide the interns with an eight-week research experience designed to increase the interns' self-  confidence and their familiarity with the graduate school environment.  It will also provide  mentoring, counseling and networking opportunities.    SPWSEM'94 will complement our NSF and Department of Education sponsored programs which  include women students.  However, this effort will tailor these successful programs specifically  for women in SEM.  A research experience is the cornerstone of the summer program.   SPWSEM'94 interns will be paired with faculty and graduate student mentors from the students'  chosen disciplines.  In addition, SPWSEM'94 faculty and graduate student mentors will provide  encouragement and training for the interns to help them learn methods for persisting through the  difficulties of pursing graduate study in primarily male-dominated fields.  SPWSEM'94 is further  designed to create opportunities for informal personal interactions with faculty, graduate students  and interns, and to foster effective learning strategies and communication skills.  We will  provide a number of enrichment activities including panel discussions by research faculty,  discipline specific computer workshops, and panel discussions with university, government and  industry scientists, mathematicians and engineers regarding career opportunities and innovations  in three represented fields.  Interns also will received financial aid counseling and graduate  school admissions counseling.  At the end of the research experience, i nterns will present their  research papers at a research forum for evaluation by faculty members and their peers.  As an  extension of the summer activity, student interns will attend a local or regional professional  meeting with their mentors and will be encouraged to present a paper at that meeting.  Interns  will also receive a student membership in professional SEM organization for women to  encourage them to make professional contacts that can provide participants with support  throughout their graduate and professional careers.  The success of SPWSEM'94 will be  evaluated by a two-year comparison study of students who did not participate in an intervention  program and of the SPWSEM'94 interns.    ***",
