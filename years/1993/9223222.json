 "awd_abstract_narration": "Easy access to scholarly resources is at once a frustration and a               challenge. Both archivists and scholars in the history of science               have become increasingly aware of the opportunities afforded by the             use of electronic media.  The possibility of integrating                        productivity-enhancing tools with the resources themselves holds                great promise for more efficient, and more thorough, archive use.                                                                                               By its close, Scientists on Disk, will have processed more than 20,000          pages from the J. Robert Oppenheimer archives at the Library of                 Congress.  Under a previous grant, Dr. Kargon has assessed and                  tested several delivery media, including CD-ROM and digital tape.               Yet an important consequence of their investigations has been to                realize the current and future significance of network-based                    information.  They have concluded that the existing research                    network, Internet, is the best way to allow world-wide scholarly                access to electronic media archives.                                                                                                                            Existing communications software can be adapted to facilitate                   Internet access to the Oppenheimer archives already converted to                digital form.  Doing so would make possible the near-instantaneous              use of these resources by scholars and students world-wide.  Under              this grant, Dr. Kargon and his collaborator Jeremy Kargon are:                                                                                                  1) extending an existing network protocol (WAIS) to accommodate                 electronic resources such as images and multiple-type documents so              that electronic archives might more accurately represent scholarly              documents;                                                                                                                                                      2) making a prototype and disseminating a model information client              to handle better such extensions, as well as a wider range of data              types (including compressed images and bibliographic information);                                                                                              3) implementing and maintaining an information server integrating               these changes, using the previously scanned Oppenheimer documents.                                                                                              Properly equipped users around the world will be able to access                 this and other archives in a single, integrated fashion.  Together              with other fast-developing network tools, these efforts should                  encourage the proliferation of network-based, multi-media                       resources.",
