 "awd_abstract_narration": "The plasma sheet varies from a thin stretched configuration during              substorm growth phase to a broad dipolar configuration during                   substorm expansion phase.  Magnetotail electric currents flow                   primarily from dawn to dusk through the plasma sheet.  Part of this             cross-tail current is diverted to the ionosphere, where auroras are             produced.  The overall goal of the proposed project is to obtain a              better physical understanding of how magnetotail current is carried             by individual particles under a variety of conditions.  Special                 emphasis will be placed on the inner tail.  The current carrying                ions will be studied by tracing individual particle orbits.                     Several types of ion trajectories are found in different regions of             the magnetotail.  Adiabatic orbits characteristic of the ring                   current and radiation belts are present at low altitudes.  Chaotic,             quasi-adiabatic, and trapped orbits alternate farther out, in the               region of most interest.  Quasi-adiabatic orbits usually dominate               in the distant tail.  Electrons behave adiabatically in all the                 regions that will be studied.  The first stage of analysis combines             these groups of particles to generate a series of self-consistent               plasma sheet models, each applying to a small region of the tail.               In a self-consistent model, the charged particles must carry the                electric current that generates the magnetic field in which the                 orbits were traced.  The local models then will be coupled in order             to study current diversion and larger scale mangetotail structures.             Finally, the structures must be mapped and coupled to the                       ionosphere.",
