 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to determine the long-term                     dynamics of how moose affect plant species distribution,                        ecosystems, and landscapes at several different spatial and                     temporal scales.  This will allow integration individual behavior               with population and ecosystem ecology.  The previous work has                   demonstrated that selective browsing by moose on hardwoods                      increases dominance of spruce, which in turn depresses soil                     nitrogen availability because of poor litter quality.  It has also              been found that these effects are distributed non-randomly across               the landscape, and derive from the effects of browsing on plant                 competition, seed rain and seed bank dynamics.  Through an                      explicitly spatial simulation model of a foraging moose it has                  been shown that: 1) browsing by individual moose imposes structure              on initially random landscapes; 2) that structure as well as the                energetic status of the moose depends greatly on the foraging                   strategy used (e.g. Markovian foraging vs. foraging according to                the marginal value theorem): and 3) the foraging strategy affects               the energetic status of the moose.  Three years of study have                   suggested that episodic, cyclic, and transitional processes                     determine the sequence of how ecosystems change in response to                  browsing and how foraging decisions are subsequently altered.                   These processes occur at very different time scales along a                     continuum from short-term to long-term.  Such processes, ranging                from short to long-term, include revisitation of browsed plants by              moose, cyclic patterns of seed rain depending on mast years,                    recruitment and mortality of plants determining the sequence of                 invasion of browsed patches by unbrowsed plants, and changes in                 soil N availability resulting from manuring and changes in                      litterfall.  The sequences of short-term events partially                       determine long-term trajectories.  Conversely, long-term trends                 may be in opposite directions from that of some local short-term                events.  It is crucial that short-term results be placed in the                 context of long-term trends.                                                    %%%                                                                             Research of this nature is fundamental to the better understanding              of complex ecological systems.  Such knowledge, as it is gained,                is almost immediately applicable to the management of living                    resources; more for sustainable hunting, timber resources, and                  water quality as well.",
