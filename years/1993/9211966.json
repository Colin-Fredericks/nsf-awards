 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acellular bone was discovered over 100 years ago, and yet many             fundamental qualities of its biology remain obscure.  Acellular                 bone comprised the skeleton of the earliest vertebrates,                        \"heterostracans,\" which are now extinct.  Most living vertebrates               possess cellular bone.  However, one group of extant derived                    fishes, the Teleostei, includes many members with acellular bone.               Although it has been assumed to be similar in both groups, there                has never been a comparative study of this peculiar tissue in                   teleosts and \"heterostracans.\"                                                       This study addresses the development of acellular bone in                  \"heterostracans\" and teleosts in order to determine whether this                tissue is the same in these two distantly related groups.  Growth               series of heterostracan fossils will be compared to developmental               series of a living fish with acellular bone, Geophagus                          brasiliensis.  The study will focus on microscopic aspects of bone              such as the amount and site of cell entrapment within the hard                  tissues, the relative size of tooth-like structures, and how these              factors relate to the overall pattern of morphogenesis.  The result             will be the first comprehensive developmental study of earliest                 vertebrate hard tissues.  Furthermore, it will elucidate some basic             aspects of the biology of acellular bone.",
