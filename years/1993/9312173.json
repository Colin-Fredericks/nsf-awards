 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312173  Hwu-Sadwick  An investigation of some of the most promising thermodynamically stable, chemically inert, elemental metal-phosphide binary compound heteroepitaxial candidates to indium phosphide (InP) is proposed.  Electrical and Optical characterizations at both room temperature and after elevated temperature annealing will be carried out and theoretical studies will be conducted to develop the understanding of the material and device properties of these new heteroepitaxial barriers to InP binary and ternary compound material.    Optical measurements such as photoluminenscence (PL), photoreflectance (PR), Raman, absorption and transmission and electrical measurements such as capacitance versus voltage (CV), current versus voltage (I-V), photoresponse, and resistivity measurements for the Schottky contacts and transmission line and resistivity measurements for the Ohmic contacts will be performed to determine the material and device characteristics of these new material systems.  The RE-P heteroepitaxial layers will also be grown on semi-insulating InP substrates so that Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and resistivity versus temperature measurements can be performed in an effort to ascertain whether the RE-P epilayers are metals, semimetals, semiconductors, or insulators.  Simulation models will be developed to perform energy band structure and bandgap calculations of these new material systems.  In addition, novel ternary compounds such as RExIn1-xP will be theoretically studied.  ***",
