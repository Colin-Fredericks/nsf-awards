 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311472  Chang  Tsien Hsue-shen came to the United States from China in 1935 in  order to study aerodynamics at Caltech under Theodore von Karman.   During the McCarthy period of the Cold War, Tsien was falsely  accused of being a Communist spy and was forced to return to China  in 1955.  He brought back to his homeland all the skills he had  learned in the US and became the lead rocket scientist for the  Chinese military.  Under his guidance, China developed its own  ballistic missiles capable of carrying warheads to destroy targets  throughout Asia.  Ms. Chang is undertaking a study of this \"Father  of the Chinese Missile\" both in the US and in China.    Ms. Chang's study of Tsien's life promises to shed new light on the  history of the development of nuclear missiles in both the US and  China and to illuminate some of the worldwide consequences of  McCarthyism.  Her study also includes an account of the turbulent  relationship between science and politics of the 20th century  through the analysis of scientific mentorship of three generations  of world-class aerodynamicists--Ludwig Prantl who taught von Karman  in Germany who taught Tsien in the US.  Prantl disowned von Karman,  a Jew, in Nazi Germany.  In turn, von Karman failed Tsien when he  was attacked by the McCarthyites.  Tsien, following his mentors,  denounced his students during the Cultural Revolution of 1965.  ***",
