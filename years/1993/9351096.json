 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351096  Holliday  The Department of Physics and Instrumentation at Athens State  College is engaged in a major project to offer its students a  quality, state-of-the-art laboratory experience to accompany  classroom lectures.  Computers, data acquisition software, and  interfacing hardware are being used in an interfacing and  instrumentation laboratory that offers students in our  Instrumentation Technology and Physics programs a quality  laboratory in which to work and exercise their creativity.  Instrumentation students have opportunities to take scenarios  of their own design and implement them on a modern system.  These students also have the opportunity to take part in an  individual or group design and implementation project. Many of  these projects require students to design a system to measure  some physical quantity associated with some physical situation,  such as light intensity, temperature, or sound frequency. Many  of the projects lend themselves easily to applications in the  laboratories associated with our upper level physics classes.  The equipment that has been acquired therefore serves to  acquaint students in two disciplines with state-of-the-art  techniques and apparatus, and each discipline does so within  the correct context of that discipline; instrumentation  students in the design and implementation of data acquisition  systems, and physics students in the use of modern apparatus to  perform experiments and analyze data.   ***",
