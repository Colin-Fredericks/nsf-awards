 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308905  Fuster    When one wants to remember a piece of information like a telephone  number for 20 seconds or so, one uses a memory process called  active or working memory. This working memory resembles a mental  scratchpad. When the information has been used to dial the phone,  the scratchpad is erased and the information is gone. If the number  was dialed incorrectly, it has to be looked up again because no  trace remains. Thus this memory process differs from that used in  long term memory where the trace remains permanently. Neurons in  the cerebral cortex fire actively during the interval that the  information is \"kept in mind.\" With this NSF grant, Dr. Fuster a  pioneer in the study of biological memory, will use multielectrode  arrays to record from active memory cells and correlate the  activity of neighboring cells when memories are being kept in mind  and when they are erased. He will compare these correlations to  those simulated by an artificial neural network, in order to  elucidate the cortical architecture and connectivity that is  necessary to provide such a memory capability. The results will  improve our understanding of biological memory and our ability to  design artificial circuits that remember and adapt.***",
