A primary goal of NEARnet is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources between institution, including  those outside the state.       NEARnet will provide operations management and information  services and it will give the universities and colleges a  connection to the NSFNET, a high speed (1.5 - 45 million bits per  second) National Backbone network.       The each of the universities has written a description of its  organization and a statement of the benefits of Internet access  that it expects including:  greater functionality and network speed  to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file  transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable mail  system.  Students and faculty research will benefit from the links.   This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to explore  innovative educational resources.  Their diversity will expose  NEARnet to a broader range of user requirements.  NEARnet will use  the information obtained by serving this diverse group for the  benefit of New England's academic and research community.  ***",
