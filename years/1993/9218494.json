 "awd_abstract_narration": "9218494  Taflove  This project seeks to develop novel  three-dimensional time-domain  algorithms for optical pulse  propagation, scattering, and  switching (including femtosecond  pulses) using the full vector  nonlinear time-domain Maxwell's  equations, with specific  applications of glass and  semiconductor materials.   Algorithms will be implemented on  supercomputers of the class of the  Cray C-90 or Cray T3D.  One  algorithm to be explored involves  solving a time-domain system of  ordinary differential equations for  the bandgap physics of  semiconductor materials  concurrently with the time-domain  vector Maxwell's equations.  This  algorithm could permit detailed  modeling of the pulse dynamics of  passive and active optical and  electrooptic devices including  switches and laser sources.  A  second approach of interest  involves applying computational  fluid dynamics techniques for  tracking shock waves to model  possible optical shock waves in  nonlinear media.  Overall, the  project will develop and apply  novel time-domain algorithms to  explore the dynamics of a variety  of optical wave species in  nonlinear media in three  dimensions, including \"light  bullets\"  and shocked-wave optical  pulses.  These may exhibit  favorable properties  with respect  to all-optical switching at  relatively low laser power levels  because of unique properties  arising form their temporal and  spatial confinement or shocked  carrier, respectively.  There would  exist potential  engineering  applications in the realization of  novel ultra-fast sub-millimeter-  size all-optical digital logic  elements operation at low laser  power levels.  ***",
