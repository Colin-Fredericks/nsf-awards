 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308912  Tai  In many real-time distributed systems where both performance and  dependability are critical, the conditions affecting these two  attributes in the system itself as well as its environment may  change dynamically.  In order to assure high performance  dependable computing, a computer/communication system's  operational strategies and requirements have to be adjusted  responsively.    The research studies adaptive performability management  (performability is a combined measure of performance and  dependability) for assuring performance and dependability goals  simultaneously via run-time model-based decision making.  The  method will provide a computer system with the capability to  determine,  based on the underlying performability model, whether  it achieves its performance and dependability goals.  If not, it  will select an alternative strategy.  The objectives of this  research are to investigate the utility of performability  concepts and modeling techniques when the object system is in  operation, and to investigate the effectiveness of the resulting  methodology in assuring high performance dependable computing.  Accordingly, the focus will be on: 1) methods of model  construction which stress the tradeoffs among performance,  dependability and other critical attributes and facilitate  adaptive performability management, 2) methods of model solution  which are sufficiently efficient to support run-time decision  making, and 3) methods for evaluating the effectiveness of an  adaptive performability management scheme.  ***",
