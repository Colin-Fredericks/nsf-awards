 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall process of gene expression involves several events             including transcription, RNA processing, mRNA degradation,                      translation, and post-translational protein modification.  Very                 little is known concerning the mechanism or regulation of mRNA                  degradation.  The focus of the proposed experiments is to                       characterize mRNA instability sequences that determine the rapid                decay rate of labile mRNAs.  An instability determinant originating             from the E. coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene has been                identified (287R) that can function in a cis-dominant manner to                 destabilize the normally stablw ompA mRNA.  Several approaches will             be used to characterize the 287R instability determinant.  1)                   Deletions will be introduced into the sequence to identify the                  smallest sequence that still has destabilizing activity.  2) Site-              directed mutagenesis will be used to further define the minimum                 instability sequence and to probe the functional importance of                  potential structures within the sequence.  3) The ribonuclease that             recognizes this instability sequence will be identified.  Initially             the function of the instability sequence will be tested in mutants              defective in known ribonucleases.  If these experiments indicate                that a novel ribonuclease interacts with the 287R sequence, it will             be isolated and characterized.  An in vitro decay assay will be                 developed and used to monitor enzyme purification.  4) If time                  permits, the effect of this instability determinant on growth rate              regulation of ompA mRNA decay in E. coli will also be investigated.             %%%                                                                             The goal of this project is to elucidated the mechanisms by which               cells degrade messenger RNA molecules.  mRNA degradation is a basic             metabolic process and is vital to the organism's survival and                   adaptation abilities.  The decay rate of a particular mRNA can                  influence the amount of protein synthesized from that transcript                and thereby have a critical impact on the expression levels of the              corresponding gene.  The experiments outlined in this proposal will             characterize elements within mRNAs called instability determinants              that result in the rapid decay of labile mRNAs.  The sequences or               structures that are required for the function of an instability                 determinant will be defined, and the cellular enzymes that                      recognizes these sequences will be identified.",
