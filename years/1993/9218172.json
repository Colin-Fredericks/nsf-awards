 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Professor Richard O. Buckius of the University of Illinois              and Professor Kunio Hijikata of Tokyo Institute of Technology and               Professor Toshiro Makino of Kyoto University.  The objective is to              experimentally and theoretically analyze radiative heat transfer                properties of surfaces and films from first principles.  Usual                  radiant energy transfer calculations for surfaces and films make                rather ad hoc assumptions about the surfaces roughness, length                  scales, and material properties due to the lack of fundamental                  knowledge of the radiation scattering characteristics and the                   interface parameters.  Very common engineering approximations                   include specular reflection, diffuse reflection, constant bulk                  material properties, small interface roughness, etc.  These                     approximations are often inaccurate for surfaces used in many                   practical applications, and they usually require an empirical                   approach to determine specific values of the radiative properties.              The collaborative project considers exact approaches to the                     quantification of the radiative surface properties through the use              of general electromagnetic scattering and molecular kinetic                     theories.  The U.S. group is addressing the rough and configured                surfaces while the Japanese groups are studying the superconducting             films and optical properties and rough films from a fractal-based               approach.",
