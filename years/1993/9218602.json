 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problem scale has a significant effect on the way that hydrologic               phenomena are observed and explained.  Recent hydrologic research               has clearly demonstrated that laboratory results may not adequately             reflect field scale behavior, that models developed at one scale                may not be valid at other scales, and that small scale variability              may have large scale consequences.  This research project is                    designed to help hydrologists obtain a clearer understanding of                 scale effects and their relevance to practical hydrologic                       investigations.  It examines the complex relationship between                   natural variability and the models and data collection programs                 that from the basis for scientific hydrology.  The first phase of               the project reviews stochastic methods for describing natural                   variability over a range of time and space scales.  The second                  phase examines new techniques for deriving scale-dependent                      estimates of hydrologic quantities.  The final phase of research                considers how field data can be used to improve the accuracy of                 these estimates.  The stochastic approach adopted in the project                provides a way to quantify important scale-dependent tradeoffs                  between model resolution, sampling effort, and estimation accuracy.             This approach is illustrated with applications to groundwater flow              and transport.",
