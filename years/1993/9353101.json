 "awd_abstract_narration": "BILL NYE THE SCIENCE GUY is a half-hour, weekly children's  science education series produced in Seattle, Washington by  McKenna/Gottlieb Producers Inc. and KCTS Television in  association with Rabbit Ears Production. The series is  designed to make science assessable and interesting to  children in the of forth and fifth grades by relating science  at the interests and everyday activities of children and  presenting basic concepts from elementary science curricula in  a humorous and exciting format. Programs are set in a variety  of studio and field locations and utilize special effects and  the creative techniques of  host Bill Nye, a popular  television entertainer and science aficionado.  In each  program, studio demonstrations/experiments and field segments  feature Nye and a diverse cast of children, scientists and  celebrity guests.  Experiments and demonstrations use  inexpensive, safe household items to enable viewers to follow  along at home or in the classroom. As part of the promotion  and outreach for the series, ancillary materials such as a  teacher's guide, parent's guide, activity packages and  newsletters will be developed and made available to schools as  well as in the home and such informal setting as community  centers, libraries, and clubs.   ***",
