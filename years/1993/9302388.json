 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded under the National Science Foundation's                  (NSF) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which is               designed to provide an opportunity for small business, particularly             the small high technology firm, to participate in NSF research.                 Phase I of the SBIR program serves as a filter to select promising              proposals and determine if the firm can do high quality research.               Phase II is the principal research project.  Phase III is the                   conversion of the NSF-funded research into commercial applications              and technological innovation supported by follow-on private venture             capital or other non-federal financing.  This Phase II project                  addresses the use of wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and                 optical amplification to handle multimedia communications with                  varying data rates in both analog and digital formats in a single               optical network.  In Phase I the researcher developed an                        optically-amplified subnetwork-partititoned WDM network concept                 with the following attributes: multiple wavelength-addressed                    virtual subnetworks, compatibility with other network standards                 including FDDI; incremental and flexibile upgradability; and high               reliability.  In Phase II the company is designing, building, and               evaluating a small scale experimental 4-node WDM network                        integrating wavelength MUXs/DeMUXs, tunable transmitters/receivers,             optical amplifiers, a star coupler and an FDDI adapter board.  The              network will serve as a testbed for subsequent Phase III                        commercialization.",
