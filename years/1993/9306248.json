 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ecological study of how populations are regulated in their             numbers and abundance has moved from single-factor investigations               to more complex analyses of multiple factors.  Plants and their                 insect herbivores present a favorable system for experimental                   manipulation in order to tease apart these multiply interacting                 factors.  Dr. Harrison in a planning grant is studying the western              tussock moth that feeds upon lupines across a 1000 km north-south               transect.  Competition for lupine herbage as well as predation by               ants and other insect predators upon the moth larvae are being                  studied through experimental enclosures and other manipulations.                Parasitism and insect dispersal are also being monitored in order               to construct an abstract model of population regulation, with                   identification of differing control points along the north-south                climatic gradient.                                                              %%%                                                                                  The complexity of ecological factors affecting the numbers and             abundance of organisms makes experimental manipulations challenging             but necessary.  Dr. Harrison in a research planning grant is                    beginning an ambitious investigation of the western tussock moth                that feeds on native lupines in coastal California, along with the              ant and other insect predators of the moth, along a 1000 km north-              south transect.  One goal is to identify controlling factors in the             population regulation of moths that are likely to differ in                     different parts of its latitudinal range.",
