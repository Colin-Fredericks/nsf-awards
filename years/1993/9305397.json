 "awd_abstract_narration": "Constructed Civil Infrastructure Systems (CCIS) is one of the                   largest components of the civil engineering construction business               in the United States.  Development and implementation of advanced               and innovative CCIS technologies are pivotal for maintaining the                competitiveness of U.S. design and construction industries.  In                 particular, with a \"United Western European Community (EC) \"                    beginning in 1993, potential high-volume business opportunities are             emerging markets in previous Soviet Block Countries.  Thus, it is               important to identify CCIS state-of-the-art in Western Europe,                  forecast technology trends, and gain an understanding of the highly             effective R&D mechanisms being developed and used successfully by               western European countries for promoting and implementing                       innovation into practice in Western Europe.  ASCE's Civil                       Engineering Research Foundation (CERF) and the National Science                 Foundation (NSF), in conjunction with the World Technology                      Evaluation Center (WTEC)/Japanese Technology Evaluation Center                  (JTEC), are organizing an International Task Force trip to selected             sites in Western European countries.  //",
