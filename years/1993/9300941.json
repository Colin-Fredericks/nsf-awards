 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program                  of the Chemistry Division, Burrow and Jordan (at the                            Universities of Nebraska and Pittsburgh, respectively) will                     continue joint experimental and theoretical studies of                          low-energy electron scattering from a number of hydrocarbons.                   Experimental studies at both institutions will examine                          vibrational excitation and angular distributions                                using photoelectron spectroscopy to locate temporary anion                      states (resonances).  Jordan will calculate the location of                     resonances at Pittsburgh, first using ethylene and propene as                   model systems, and then applying those results to methyl and                    ethyl chloride.                                                                 %%%                                                                             A powerful means of visualizing molecular structure and                         chemical reactivity is provided by the concept of occupied and                  unoccupied electron states, which are also known as orbitals.                   Photoelectron spectroscopy has long provided a means of                         studying occupied orbitals, but until recently the                              corresponding data for normally unoccupied orbitals has been                    scarce.  This work aims at gathering such data, thereby helping                 to answer key chemical questions on structure and bonding in                    complex molecules.  It also offers data crucial to models of                    electron transfer, which is the mechanism involved in a large                   number of chemical processes such as photosynthesis.",
