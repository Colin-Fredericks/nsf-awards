The project's location (Oxford, Ohio) will allow it to  recruit from the large concentrations of minority, specifically  African-American, youth in the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan  areas as well as from minority youth who are isolated in rural  schools surrounding those urban areas.    In order to reach its goal of assisting people of color in becoming  more active members of the science, engineering, and mathematics  pipeline, both as American citizens and as potential employees in  related career fields, MU-SEMP will combine inquiry-based content  courses in science, mathematics, and computer science with a  supportive living and learning environment for four weeks.   Students will also attend field trips, receive training in  technical writing, communications, and research and study skills.   Guest speakers who work in science, engineering, and mathematics  careers will also provide reflections from the real world.   Furthermore, in order to assure that the supportive environment  continues after the duration of the camp, parents as well as  college students, college faculty, and middle and high school  teachers will be involved as staff and mentors.        MU-SEMP will build upon and expand the strengths of two systemic  initiatives in its geographical area.  First, Ohio's Statewide  Systemic Initiative is also located at Mia mi University, and MU-  SEMP will use teachers trained by Discovery as well as adapt  Discovery materials and curricula.  In addition, Discovery teachers  will have opportunities to work with MU-SEMP youth while both  groups are in residence in the summer.  MU-SEMP staff have been  involved previously in developing and teaching Discovery courses.   Second, Minorities in Mathematics, Science, and Engineering (M2SE),  one of the regional Alliances for Minority Progress centers is  located in Cincinnati.  Recruitment, sensitivity, and retention  techniques used in that project will be adapted for the young  teenagers who participate in the summer science camp.  Two of the  project's investigators have also been trained by this program.  In  summary, by combining rigorous education in science and mathematics  with a supportive, pleasant, residential environment, MU-SEMP will  attract, motivate, and retain more minority students in the  education pipeline.",
