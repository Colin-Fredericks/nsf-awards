The advanced program, designed with individual campus components interacting as  clusters in the broad areas of chemistry/materials science, is successfully addressing barriers to  research in the state by combining resources across institutional lines.  Collaboration among  faculty and students has resulted in more faculty and industry exchanges, has increased research  activity among the EPSCoR investigators, and has strengthened undergraduate and graduate  instruction in the departments housing the EPSCoR components.    This Experimental Systematic Initiative proposes to enhance the professional development of  faculty, student development at the undergraduate and graduate levels, education, and knowledge  transfer and interaction with industry.  It will provide funding to allow faculty and students the  opportunity to interact with experts in their areas of research through travel and through  seminars  and workshops with leading scientists.  The lack of opportunity for such activity has  been identified as one of the barriers to research in the state.  This proposal addresses three of  the objectives of the Mississippi Advanced Development EPSCoR Program:         (a)  to create a critical mass of scientists by implementing inter-institutional links;       (b)  to strengthen the scientific community by working with other ongoing programs            and by stimulating the human resource pool in the state to become actively             involved in the research and education process; and       (c)  to establish technology transfer to appropriate user groups by developing stronger             research links with other research communities and by creating mechanisms for             commercial linkages and support of university-based research.    The Mississippi EPSCoR initiative is designed to provide for the specific  needs of the students  and faculty of individual components within the program.  These activities target faculty who  will either travel to appropriate industries or participate in campus seminars conducted by invited  scientists and consultants.  They also target students involved in the EPSCoR research as well  as students at other universities in the state and region.  The seven enhancement designs are  summarized as follows:         -    Faculty interaction with corporations involved in related research in and            involvement in technical meetings on polymeric adhesion and composite            materials;       -    Faculty interaction with corporations and laboratories dealing in composite            fabrication and in short courses in stress analysis;       -    Faculty interaction with corporations and laboratories for knowledge exchange in            non-destructive evaluation (NDE), in development of numerical models simulating            NDE processes, and in analysis of ultrasonic signals; use of external consultants            with expertise in ultrasonic acoustic signal processing;       -    A three-day symposium and workshop for state and regional investigators and            students with leading scientists in state-of-the-art solution, solid state and micro-            imaging nuclear magnetic resonance experiments;       -    Faculty and student travel for professional conferences; planned conference on            computational chemistry with recognized speakers;       -    Undergraduate research opportunities for visiting students; research assistance for            new EPSCoR faculty with competence in physical chemistry of surfaces;       -    A series of ten seminars with invited scientists addressing spectroscopic            interrogation of transient species in chemical and biological systems for faculty            and graduate students.",
