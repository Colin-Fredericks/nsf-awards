 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most universities require all students to attain some                           understanding of computing as part of their college experience.                 Often courses in \"computer literacy\" are offered to meet this                   requirement.  These courses, as they are currently taught, are                  often inadequate for a number of reasons.  First they tend to                   present descriptions of what computers can do rather than focus                 on how people can use computers to solve problems.  Also, they                  concentrate on teaching the syntax of currently popular                         software packages or programming languages, instead of focusing                 on the underlying characteristics of these tools.  These                        courses also fail to represent the breadth of the computing                     sciences.  Hence, what is learned tends to be shallow and of                    short term value.                                                               There is a critical need for a general course, accessible to                    the average college freshman, that will introduce the                           underlying principles of computing while stimulating the                        student's problem solving abilities.  The proposed course will                  meet these objectives.  The hear of the approach is to present                  abstract concepts through the use of computer-based                             simulations.  These simulations will allow students to explore                  the concepts in a \"hands on\" manner.                                            The course is designed to be taught in a single semester and                    will provide an overview of computer science.  Many facets of                   the discipline will be explored through lecture and the                         accompanying laboratory exercises.  Topics include:  common                     applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, computer aided                   design, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics;                         algorithms and the major programming paradigms (functional,                     procedural, and logical); computer architecture, including                      machine organization and digital logic; and foundations of                      computing, including automata theory, Turing machines, and                      complexity theory.                                                              The course development effort is truly interdisciplinary with                   faculty from Computer Science, Business Administration,                         Education, Engineering, and Arts and Sciences actively involved                 in the course design.  Evaluation plans call for initial                        development of the course materials at Louisiana Tech                           University followed by their use a several other universities.                  Plans for dissemination include making all courseware developed                 for this project available via the Internet.  The PIs also plan                 to write an introductory computer science text to facilitate                    the use of the course materials at other institutions.                          The essence of this development is a structured laboratory                      environment, including both open and closed labs, that is                       completely integrated with the lectures.  It is the PIs belief                  that abstract concepts can be taught to, and understood by,                     students with limited math backgrounds if provided hands-on                     laboratory activities that cover the basic concepts. Students                   completing the course are expected to have a much greater                       appreciation for the computing sciences and many may be                         inspired to pursue careers in this area.",
