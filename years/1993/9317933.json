 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317933  Forgacs    The proposed research represents a collaborative project entitled  \"Physical Mechanisms of Morphogenesis\".  Tissue morphogenesis is  the process by which the form of the body and its various organs is  established in the embryo, and by which normal and abnormal changes  in the adult, such as wound healing and tumor invasion, are brought  about.  The two PIs on this collaborative project, Stuart Newman  (New York Medical College) and Gabor Forgacs (Clarkson University)  propose to continue a program of interdisciplinary studies on the  idea that 'generic' physical properties of tissue, such as surface  tension, interfacial tension, and viscosity contribute importantly  to the tissue's morphogenetic behaviors.  Model mesenchymal tissue  containing suspended cells, or  cell-sized latex particles with  specific surface coatings, will be analyzed with respect to the  dependence of their surface and interfacial tension and viscosity  on the composition and macromolecular concentration of the matrix,  as well as the number per volume and surface characteristics of the  suspended cells or particles.  Interfacially-driven cell transport  in model matrices ('matrix-driven translocation') will be used as  a tool to study the dependence of morphogenetic properties on  physical and compositional variables.  The ability of living  mesenchymal tissue derived from avian embryos to mix, or to form  boundaries of immiscibility, will be correlated with the presence  of networks of extracellular fibers and the experimental disruption  of such networks.  A theoretical framework will be developed for  interpreting the relationship among physical, compositional, and  microscopic morphology of model tissues, and their capacity to form  interfaces, to flow, and to exhibit other morphogenetic changes.  ***",
