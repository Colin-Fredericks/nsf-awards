 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support a Conference on Graduate Programs in             the Applied Mathematical Sciences to be held April 16-17, 1993 at               Clemson University.  Major objectives of the conference are to                  project characteristics of successful graduate programs for the                 1990's and beyond, to identify those characteristics of current                 programs that are essential for success, and to clarify nonacademic             employment opportunities.  Both masters and doctoral programs will              be addressed.  Specific conference objectives are:  (1) to review               the current state of graduate education in the applied mathematical             sciences; (2) to obtain perspectives on current                                 industrial/government employment opportunities and placement; (3)               to clarify methods to attract undergraduates to graduate study in               the mathematical sciences; and (4) to publicize graduate applied                mathematical science programs to the university community and                   potential students.  Major themes of the conference will be recent              developments within the mathematical sciences, their utility as                 essential ingredients for the solution of modern technological                  problems, and the challenges and opportunities these developments               present to graduate education in the future.                                         Individuals from universities, industry, and government                    laboratories, who possess a broad perspective, will be invited                  participants.  Representatives from the professional societies,                 including the American Mathematical Society, the American                       Statistical Association, the Operations Research Society of                     America, and the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics                 will also be invited.  A forum will be provided within which                    leaders in the field can assess and make recommendations for future             graduate programs.  A conference proceedings will be published.",
