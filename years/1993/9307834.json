 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first three-dimensional, multimoment, mulifluid model will be               developed to study plasma transport phenomena in the auroral                    ionosphere and their relation to global plasma dynamics.  The                   formation of potential structures in the auroral ionosphere, their              connection to low-frequency waves and their association with plasma             heating and acceleration are important and outstanding issues                   concerning Ionosphere-Magnetosphere coupling.  To investigate these             processes we will generalize our existing one-dimensional (1D)                  multimoment, multifluid transport model \u0131Granguli et al., 1988! to              three-dimensions by adapting an existing 3D transport code \u0131Guzdar              et al., 1992!.  The proposed 3D code will preserve the extensive                magnetic field-aligned dynamics of our 1D model.  The 3D fluid                  equations permit a class of low-frequency fluid instabilities and               the associated cross-field transport to be treated simultaneously.              The consequences of these low-frequency instabilities on auroral                processes, such as the formation of potential structures, could be              significant but remain unexplored as yet.  The cross-field                      transport can substantially moderate the conclusions of 1D or 2D                models.  Since the transport is self-consistently generated by                  plasma fluid instabilities, a unified picture that incorporates                 both the instability and transport processes requires a 3D                      formulation.  We will use the 3D model to investigate (1) self-                 consistent generation of auroral potential structures and (2) the               associated auroral acceleration processes including plasma heating              due to kinetic instabilities.  The macroscopic effects of relevant              kinetic instabilities (such as the electrostatic ion cyclotron                  instability) will be incorporated into our 3D model via anomalous               collision terms, as was done in our 1D model.  The theoretical                  modeling effort will proceed in tandem with the experimental                    programs of Dr. J.L. Burch, Southwest Research Institute and Dr.                T.E. Moore, NASA/MSFC.",
