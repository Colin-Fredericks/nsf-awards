 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effectiveness of law in producing social change has long been               a matter of debate, and there is no more important focus for this               debate than the impact of civil rights laws on the economic welfare             of minorities.  Many have argued recently that federal civil rights             policy has been of little value in enhancing the economic welfare               of blacks in American society.  With relative black economic gains              largely stalled since the mid-1970's, there is considerable policy              interest in determining whether and to what extent past                         governmental initiatives have contributed to black progress.  Given             the complex and varied economic, social, and governmental                       initiatives that were unfolding at the time, it will be a work of               major significance to sort out more precisely the factors that                  generated large relative economic gains in the decade after 1964.               This research will apply a more comprehensive and rigorous research             design to assess recent claims that: 1) the Supreme Court's                     decision in Brown had no important impact on the civil rights                   movement or on the evolution of black economic progress; 2)                     employment discrimination law has served little function because                virtually all of black economic advance has come from long-term                 trends of migration and improved education; and 3) the breakthrough             of black employment in the textile industry merely represents the               removal of Southern segregationist legislation, and that without                such legal restrictions competitive markets quickly eradicate any               adverse effects of private discrimination.                                                                                                                      This grant will support a comprehensive assessment of all aspects               of the total federal effort directed against a way of life that                 excluded blacks from many sectors of Southern society in order to               capture the impact of civil rights policy, including spillovers to              successful employment of challenges to school segregation and                   voting exclusion.  The research will demonstrate that a complex                 pattern of law  -  both segregationist and antidiscrimination  -                emerged over time and in different states and regions.  The                     investigators will use this temporal and geographic variation in                the institutional structure confronting blacks as the basis for                 explaining the different patterns of black economic growth in                   different states and regions.  In addition, the investigators will              compile a significant data set on school quality by state and race              (where possible) going back to 1890.  Once the investigators have               documented the evolving patterns of the educational attainment of               blacks and whites and the legal environments promoting or                       restricting black opportunities, they will append this information              to the data on income and education found in the decennial Census               tapes from 1940-1990.  This will permit the investigators to                    undertake a comprehensive econometric assessment of the factors                 that have contributed to black economic advance.",
