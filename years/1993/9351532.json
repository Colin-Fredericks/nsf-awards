 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351532  Mullen  This project is completing the modernization of a computerized  weather laboratory.  We are patterning our laboratory after the  successful \"Networked Desktop Synoptic Laboratory\" that was  developed by the Department of Atmospheric Science at the  University of Illinois, but our laboratory is being tailored to  fit the specific needs of our undergraduate program.  We are  initially relying upon analysis and display software supported  and distributed by the NSF-sponsored UNIDATA Program which will  minimize the project's \"spin-up\" time.  Once the proposed  laboratory facilities are in place, new analysis software and  laboratory exercises will be developed by the PI that, once  thoroughly tested, will be donated to the UNIDATA Program  Center Office for distribution to other interested atmospheric  science departments.  The modernized laboratory fulfills the department's projected  hardware needs in the area of undergraduate laboratory  instruction in synoptic meteorology (both for upper-division  majors and survey-level non-science majors) for the next 5  years. It allows us to take full advantage of the ongoing  modernization of the National Weather Service (NWS) which  includes the eventual co-location of our department with the  NWS Tucson Forecast Office.  ***",
