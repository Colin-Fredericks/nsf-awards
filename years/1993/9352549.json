 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed Instructional Co-generation Laboratory would                       expand our experimental instruction in thermodynamics, fluid                    mechanics, heat transfer, electrical generation, data                           acquisition, and system design. The requested system includes                   a gas turbine/generator, a waste heat boiler, a condenser, an                   absorption cooler, and a computer data acquisition and control                  system with continuous stack gas monitoring. The system will be                 used to perform a series of experiments in our Mechanical                       Engineering and Engineering Technology programs. In addition to                 the usual general performance evaluations, the experiments                      would include convection and two-phase heat transfer,                           psychometrics and stack gas monitoring. Both of our programs                    include senior project sequences which give the students                        experience in engineering design. Much of the engineering                       design for the proposed laboratory would be done--with faculty                  supervision--as projects in these courses. The completed system                 would serve about 100 students per year by providing                            experimental operation and detailed performance analysis of a                   modern co-generation and cooling system.",
