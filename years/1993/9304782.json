 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304782  Okamura  Photosynthetic bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy  by photo-induced electron transfer reactions in a pigment protein  complex called the reaction center (RC).  The initial charge  separation within the RC is coupled to electron transfer across  the membrane by electron transfer from a mobile electron carrier,  cytochrome c2.  Important features of the reaction between the RC  and cytochrome c2 are the high rate of electron transfer and also  the molecular recognition of electron transfer partners.  The  structural basis for these two properties will be investigated by  studying the effects of mutating the following types of residues:  (1) Charged residues on the RC and cytochrome will be modified to  investigate electrostatic interactions between the two redox  partners.  Complementary charge changes on the RC (negative to  positive charged residues) and cytochrome  (negative to positive  charged residues) will be made to map out the specific ion  pairing interactions in the cytochrome RC complex.  (2)   Uncharged residues on the RC surface near the cytochrome binding  site will be mutated to residues having different molecular sizes  and hydrophobicity.  The pattern of changes in binding and  electron transfer observed will be used to map out the binding  interaction and possible pathways for electron transfer.  %%%  Biological systems derive much of their energy from electron  transfer between proteins in biological membranes.  Two major  questions of electron transfer that are currently not understood  are:  How do electron donor and acceptor proteins recognize and  bind to each other?  and what is the pathway for electron  transfer though proteins?   The answers to both of these  questions will be studied for the reaction between the bacterial  reaction center and cytochrome c2, from the photosynthetic  bacterium Rb. sphaeroides.  ***",
