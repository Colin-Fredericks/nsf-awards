 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a study of the integrative aspects of                  fluid and electrolyte balance in birds.  Because of the lack of a               urinary bladder, the urine of birds enters the terminal portion of              the gastrointestinal tract, the cloaca.  The urine does not remain              here, but moves in an oral direction into the rectum where it comes             into contact with epithelial tissues capable of active transport.               Thus, conditions are created under which the composition of the                 urine can be modified.  Because of this anatomical and functional               relationship, the kidneys of birds do not have sole control of                  fluid and electrolyte balance, as is the case for mammals.  In this             proposal, I plan to investigate several components of this system.              These are:  1) An investigation of the factors that control the                 movement of urine from the cloaca into the intestine.  Does this                movement occur at all times, or does it vary with the composition               and volume of the urine?  If it does vary, what parameters are                  sensed and how are they detected?  2) An investigation of the                   concentrating mechanism of the bird kidney.  What limits the                    capacity of the bird kidney to concentrate the urine?  Typically,               the kidneys of birds do not concentrate the urine well when                     compared to those of mammals.  3) An investigation of binding of                uric acid to proteins in the urine of birds.  The concentration of              uric acid in the urine of birds greatly exceeds the solubility                  limits for this compound.  Crystal formation is prevented by the                binding of uric acid to a protein (glycoprotein).  Where does this              protein come from and how does it bind uric acid?  Domestic fowl                (Gallus domesticus) are to be used as experimental animals to                   generate data to test the hypothesis of this proposal.  Data                    generated by the proposed research will lead to a better                        understanding of the regulation of fluid and electrolyte balance                and should help to correct some of the misconceptions about avian               osmoregulation.//",
