The goal was to inhibit the development of enclaves in order to  bring about rapid assimilation into host communities.  Family  reunification and secondary migration led to a concentration of  Southeast Asians in nine states, however.  Communities which  responded to the initial call for sponsors developed large  enclaves, while other areas experienced a net out migration of  refugees to other locations.  Still other regions saw development  of large refugee communities through secondary migration.  This  research project will examine the evolution of the national  geography of the various Southeast Asian refugee groups since  1975 and determine the role of voluntary agencies in defining  settlement patterns through sponsor recruitment practices.  Primary data from the office of refugee resettlement will be  analyzed to trace the development of spatial enclaves over time  and to isolate the process by which enclaves came into being.  Community-based organizations will be surveyed in four central  California cities in order to determine their role in the  differential adjustment experiences of refugees who have settled  or resettled in those communities.       Ethnic enclaves exist, but how, where, and why they form are  complex and incompletely understood processes.  This study  captures the settlement and adjustment process of immigrants and  first-born generations in locations where there were no pre-  exiting enclaves.  Analysis of the roles of active sponsors,  community-based organizations, and community response will  contribute to an understanding of ethnic enclave formation and  development.  At the national level, the study will show the  influence of voluntary organizations in delimiting the geography  of sponsorship and primary resettlement and the effects of  secondary mi gration in channeling refugees to emerging enclaves.  At a local level, the research examines community organizations  as facilitators of cultural exchange between various Southeast  Asian groups and host communities.  In addition to contributing  to the theoretical literature on immigration, acculturation, and  enclave formation, results of this research will aid in the  development of informed immigration and refugee policy in the  United States.  ***",
