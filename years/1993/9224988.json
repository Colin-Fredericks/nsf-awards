 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224988  Richards  The Earth's hot oxygen corona may play a significant role in a  number of important phenomena in the Earth's upper atmosphere.   These phenomena include (1) the maintenance of the night  ionosphere, (2) the helium balance (escape flux), and (3) the  supply of energetic ions to the plasmasphere.  Before these effects  can be studied, it will be necessary to develop a numerical model  of hot oxygen which will include quenching of metastable species as  important new sources.  It will also be necessary to develop a  similar model for hot nitrogen atoms because many reactions produce  energetic nitrogen atoms which may impact the hot oxygen geocorona.  The new hot oxygen model will employ the 2-stream approach because  it is computationally efficient and has already been successfully  applied to similar problems in the atmospheres of Earth and Venus.   In addition, the PI has already used the 2-stream method  extensively to study the photoelectron and auroral electron  problems.  The work proposed here will contribute to the advancement of  knowledge by enhancing our understanding of the escape of light  gases from planetary atmospheres and by a better understanding of  the ionosphere and plasmasphere.  This is extremely important if we  are to assess the likely impact of human development on the  atmosphere.  The work will contribute to education by providing  student access to our comprehensive model of the ionosphere and  thermosphere.  ***",
