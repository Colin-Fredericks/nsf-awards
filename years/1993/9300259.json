 "awd_abstract_narration": "We seek funding for a two-year summer research program to                  enhance research opportunities in the field and laboratory for                  geology undergraduate students from Colgate University and other                colleges.  Our goals are to better prepare undergraduate students               for graduate education in geology and to encourage pursuit of                   future careers in the geosciences and related fields by involving               junior and senior undergraduates in a supportive research                       environment.  Minority students enrolled in Colgate University`s                pre-college summer program and in the geology department's field-               based seminar for first-year students and students from other                   colleges will be strongly encouraged to participate in our summer               program.  Research topics provide undergraduates interested in                  geology with tractable study problems that will make significant                contributions to our understanding of the geologic history of a                 classic deformed continental margin.  Research topics in New York               and New England will focus primarily on the Taconic fold/thrust                 belt, Adirondack massif, and Cortlandt Complex.  Additional                     research opportunities will be available at Colgate on topics                   related to aqueous geochemistry, clay mineralogy, and geomorphology             and in Alaska on the paleontology and sedimentology of Paleozoic                carbonates.  Student participants will begin our summer geology                 program by attending a six-week orientation field exercise where                they will learn the fundamentals of field-based research and                    undertake independent mapping exercises in a variety of                         geographical and geological contexts.  For seven weeks following                the field program, students will work on research projects in close             partnership with geology faculty at Colgate.  Students will                     continue their research as independent study projects or as senior              Honors theses during the academic year.  We will teach students how             to use analytical instrumentation in geologic research and will                 encourage them to incorporate departmental equipment (SEM/EDS, XRF,             XRD, AA, ion chromatograph, magnetometer, gravity meter,                        resistivity meter, and exploration seismograph) into their studies.             Students will present the results of their projects in a research               symposium at Colgate and (or) in coordination with faculty at                   regional geology meetings.",
