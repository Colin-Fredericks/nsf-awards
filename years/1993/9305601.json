 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with inference for longitudinal                 data, such as of survival analysis and time series type.  Tests                 and confidence intervals in such problems are typically based on                the asymptotic behavior of martingales.  This project will focus                on more accurate ways of setting critical points in such                        inference.  One approach to this problem is to transform the                    martingales to create statistics more accurately approximated by                the asymptotic distribution.  Another approach is to look for                   better approximations to the law of the martingale, via Edgeworth               or saddlepoint expansions, or bootstrapping.                                         The research is intended to improve the way statisticians                  interpret data from processes that evolve over time.  Main cases                are (1) long term medical data, where patients are followed over                a period of time, and (2) economic data.  These quite different                 types of settings can be studied with a relatively unified                      technology, which relates to the theory of fair games.                          Substantial gains in how data are interpreted can be obtained by                further exploiting this connection.",
