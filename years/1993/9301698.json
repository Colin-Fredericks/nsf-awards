 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton pigments have been used extensively to monitor                    standing stocks and rates of production and loss within algal                   communities.  Chlorophyll-derived pigments that are formed during               zooplankton grazing have also been used as tracers for the fate of              phytoplankton.  Recent advances in chromatography technology have               revealed that phytoplankton pigments actually comprise a suite of               related pigments and that some of these compounds appear to be                  uniquely associated with grazing by protozoa.  This project with                its simple, well-controlled experiments will evaluate pigment                   transformation and degradation by marine protozoa.  It's been                   hypothesized that kinds and amount of pigments produced are related             to grazer species and phytoplankton species, and that post-                     elimination processes such as detrital ingestion and photo-                     oxidation are important modifiers of pigments.  A critical issue in             the use of pigments as biomarkers is the degree to which pigment                transformations mirror transformation of organic carbon.  The                   ultimate goal of the project will be to develop a tracer which can              be used to address several important ecological questions of upper              food web dynamics.",
