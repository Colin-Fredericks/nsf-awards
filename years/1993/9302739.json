 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software process research is concerned with the problem of  systematically managing and automating the development and  maintenance of software systems.  Key challenges in software  process research include understanding and describing existing  processes, developing and specifying new processes, and evolving  existing processes toward new processes.  This project  investigates techniques in two areas of software process research  that fundamentally contribute to answering these challenges:  (1)  capture of characteristic process data and (2) analysis of  process data for purposes of detailed problem identification.  With such results, software engineers can gain a statistically-based  understanding of an existing process, uncover systemic  problems indicating areas for possible process improvement, and  calculate the effects of changes to processes.  The starting point for the investigation is an event-based model  of software processes.  An event is used to characterize the  dynamic behavior of a process in terms of identifiable,  instantaneous process milestones, such as invoking a development  tool or deciding upon the next activity to be performed.  A  novel, hybrid approach integrating automated and manual data  collection techniques records information about both computer-based  events (e.g., tool invocation) and non-computer-based  events (e.g., decision making), relating events within and across  these categories.  Metrics appropriate for revealing anomalous  software process behavior are defined and calculated.  A flexible  testbed for storage and retrieval of process data with a variety  of analysis tools is used as a basis for correlation analysis.  Results are validated by employing the techniques in the capture  and analysis of several real-world software processes used in  industry.",
