The  investigators intend to develop procedures for  the simulation of polymers in three environments  -- inclusion complexes, the amorphous polymer at  bulk density, and diblock copolymer micelles.   This research may prove valuable in gaining  insight into the factors that influence the  dynamics of flexible chains and their rate of  entry exchange into and out of micelles.  The  problems to be addressed in this research are  relevant to a wide range of practical problems in  polymer processing and polymer structure-property  relations.   Project funding will enable the  researchers to develop simulations on both  campuses and to visit each other's laboratory  over the course of this three-year study.    This project in materials research fulfills the  program objective of advancing scientific  knowledge by enabling leading experts in the  United States and Turkey to combine complementary  talents and conduct research in areas of strong  mutual interest and competence.  ***",
