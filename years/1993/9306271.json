For the biological experiments an organism is  used that is easy to culture, has a short generation time (i.e.  yields long time series data) and allows an accurate census of  animal numbers: flour beetles of the genus Tribolium.  In the first  part of the study the objectives are model identification and  parameter estimation.  In the second part, the concern is to  document transitions in the qualitative behavior of the  demographic dynamics.  Rates of reproduction and adult mortality  are manipulated in order to cross boundaries in parameter space  from stable equilibria, to periodic cycles, to chaos.  In phase  three the objectives are to test hypotheses concerning the  existence of these unusual demographic dynamics and develop  methods for identifying these phenomena in experimental data.  A  major contribution of this project is an unequivocal example of  experimentally manipulated transitions between qualitatively  different dynamical behaviors of a biological population as  predicted by a mathematical model.       In the last ten years or so, the recognition that simple  equations can generate complex dynamics has led to an outpouring  of fascinating theoretical possibilities for the explanation of  population time series data.  Understanding the observed  fluctuations in animal population numbers is a central question in  population biology; it has far-reaching applications in areas  ranging from food production and pest control, to the management  of renewable resources, to the conservation of species diversity.  The hypothesis that fluctuations are the result of nonlinear  dynamic forces has proved to be elusive to test due to the  difficulties of gathering adequate ecological data, of  experimentall y manipulating ecological systems, and of evaluating  complex mathematical models with ecological data.  In this research  project the investigators' approach to testing nonlinear  population theory is to connect mathematical models rigorously  with experimental biological data by means of newly developed  statistical methods for nonlinear time series.  The project is  unique in its interdisciplinary approach because it involves both  theory and experimentation and utilizes the talents of the  biologist, statistician, and mathematician.  It is unusual in the  field of population biology to have an interdisciplinary effort in  which investigators from all of these disciplines are involved in  all aspects of the project, from experimental design and  implementation, through theoretical modeling and analysis, to  statistical testing and verification.  The ultimate goal is to  demonstrate the usefulness and importance of nonlinear mathematics  in gaining a rigorous understanding of the dynamics of animal  populations and in particular of fluctuations in population  numbers, be these fluctations regular or \"chaotic.\"",
