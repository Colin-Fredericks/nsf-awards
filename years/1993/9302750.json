 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Eleventh Annual Southwestern Developmental Biology Conference               will be held May 14-16, 1993 at the University of Oklahoma                      Biological Station located on Lake Texoma near Kingston, OK.  The               meeting is sponsored by the Society for Developmental Biology,                  which states in its guidelines:  \"Regional meetings are an                      important activity of the Society for Developmental Biology...  The             function of the Regional Conference is to provide a more informal               opportunity than national meetings for the exchange of information              on development.  Participation by graduate students, postdoctorals              and junior faculty is particularly encouraged...\"  The meeting to               be held at the University of Oklahoma Biological Station will                   adhere to the goals outlined above.  For this conference, four                  prominent speakers (Drs. Randall Moon, Raymond Runyan, Helen                    Hathaway, and Gary Wessel) have been invited to present papers                  related to the following theme: \"Cellular Signalling and                        Recognition in Development\".  To complement these invited talks,                developmental biologists, as well as cell biologists working on                 developmentally-related problems, from the Southwest will be                    encouraged to present recent and preliminary findings on the                    meeting topic, or on any other field of developmental biology.  We              will seek especially to encourage and promote graduate students and             postdoctoral fellow participation in the scientific program by                  providing financial support to cover the costs of registration,                 housing, and travel wherever possible.  The conference format will              thus give developmental biology students in the Southwest an                    excellent opportunity to give a talk, interact with a variety of                active investigators in developmental biology, and gain a better                understanding of the developmental biology research being pursued               in their own geographic region.",
