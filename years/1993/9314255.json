SHPE student chapters officers from  across the country are brought together for three days of intensive  leadership, total quality management training and skill  acquisitions.  NSLC '91 was represented by 86 SHPE student  chapters; NSLC '92 included 100 SHPE and Mexican American  Engineering Society (MAES) student chapters.    NSLC sessions are held throughout the US and past sites have  included the Pacific Gas & Electric Training Center in San Ramon,  California and Xerox International Center for Training and  Management Development in Leesburg, Virginia.    Typical course topics include:  Team Building, Situational  Leadership, Group Dynamics, Project Management, Effective Meetings,  Conflict Resolution, and Total Quality Management (TQM).  The  participants are divided into six tracks which enables them to be  scheduled for all two-hour sessions over the three days of  workshops.  The workshops are conducted by corporate  representatives who have been so impressed with the caliber of the  participants that they asked to be considered as trainers at any  subsequent NSLC.    The NSLC is supported by SHPE's Industrial PartnerSHPE Council  (IPC) which consists of 13 member companies.  They are:  3M, Amoco,  Apple Computer, Boeing Company, Chevron Corporation, Dow Chemical,  Eastman Kodak, Hewlett-Packard, Hoechst Celanese, IBM, Kraft  General Foods, Pacific Gas and Electric and Walt Disney  Imagineering.  Each one of these companies provides a minimum of  $22,600 to support all  of SHPE's educational programs.  The NSLC is  one of the six educational programs.  The IPC contribution to NSLC  is $49,440 for 1993.    The NSLC 1993 will be held from August 19-22 at the Hickory Ridge  Conference Centre in Lisle, Illinois.  Scheduled workshop topics  include:  Financial Planning, Leadership/Professionalism.  Project  manager, Effective Communications and Team Building.  Funding for  the event is requested for transportation and housing of the  student participants.  This proposal will be administered by SHPE  Foundation and coordinated by SHPE, Inc.",
