 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gondwanan ice sheets were approximately as large as those              in the Pleistocene, but differed in one important respect, they                 were located on a supercontinent.   The interaction of the ice                  sheet with the large seasonal cycle simulated in previous energy                balance model experiments for a supercontinent configuration                    suggests a response of significant climatic interest.  Extremely                cold temperatures over the ice-covered supercontinent of Gondwanan              coupled to warm tropical latitudes should result in extreme                     baroclinicity and suggest significant melting.  This award will                 focus research on the climate system response during the time                   period of maximum Gondwanan glaciation, with a general circulation              model and five different scenarios of glacial ice extent and                    Milankovitch orbital configurations.  The influence of Milankovitch             orbital variations will be explored in a matrix of simulations                  using a present tilt-symmetric orbit, a cool summer-warm winter                 orbit for the Southern Hemisphere, and a hot summer-cold winter                 orbit for the Southern Hemisphere.  Analysis of global patterns of              circulation, temperature, and the hydrologic cycle will provide                 data to understand the global climate during glacial periods.                   Attention to the regional ice-sheet aspects of the simulations                  (e.g. surface heat budget, hydrologic cycle) will clarify the                   debate on the compatibility of a glacial ice sheet on a                         supercontinent with the large seasonal temperature ranges suggested             for large land masses.  Results will be validated against available             geologic data.",
