 "awd_abstract_narration": "The maintenance of proper intracellular levels of cholesterol is                dependent on a dynamic equilibrium between cholesterol efflux and               uptake of the lipid component after having bound to an                          extracellular acceptor in serum.  To study this phenomenon, a                   method was developed to assay the combination of \"released\"                     cholesterol with serum acceptor molecules. The objective of the                 present research is to extend the current assay in order to obtain              more information on other parameters that can influence cholesterol             efflux.  These factors include intracellular cholesterol content                and the relative activities of serum components, other than those               lipoproteins already known to regulate cholesterol homeostasis such             as lecithin cholesterol ester hydrolase (LCAT) and cholesterol                  ester transfer protein (CETP).  To begin to monitor the movement of             cholesterol after entry into the extracellular acceptor pool,                   methods will be developed to assay intracellular acyl cholesterol               ester transferase (ACAT).  Changes in ACAT activity have been shown             to correlate with cell cholesterol in numerous cell systems.  With              the ACAT enzyme assay in place, cholesterol efflux values will be               correlated with changes in serum components such as high density                lipoprotein (HDL) subclasses, other lipoproteins, and standard                  parameters of LCAT and CETP.  Finally, the new assay method will be             scaled down for screening small volume serum samples from                       genetically engineered mice, that have extra, or missing copies, of             genes for serum proteins that play a crucial role in cholesterol                metabolism.                                                                     %%%                                                                             A better method will be developed to measure changes in the                     circulating total concentration of cholesterol in serum. This is                difficult to do because cholesterol exists in combination with a                variety of different circulating serum components, and in this                  combined state, it is not detected by ordinary procedures now in                use.  Development of such an assay system and the identification of             more of the different extracellular cholesterol-absorbing                       components in serum will provide a better understanding of                      cholesterol metabolism in vertebrate animals.",
