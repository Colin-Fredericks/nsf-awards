In many free-surface flows, the  effects of viscosity and surface tension appear to be so small  that they are neglected.  However, attempts to solve the motion  of the free surface by numerical techniques, boundary integral  techniques for example, soon run into difficulties due to the  formation of curvature singularities.  Only when one of the  fluids is effectively a vacuum do numerical calculations indicate  that the motion of the free-surface is well-posed.  Obviously,  the effects of surface tension and viscosity, no matter how small  the coefficients are, become very important close to the time of  singularity development.  Precisely how these regularizing agents  prevent singularity formation, and what the nature of the  subsequent motion is, are the main thrusts of this proposal.  To  achieve this objective, the investigator uses a simple  mathematical view that describes singularity formation through  the analytic extension of the boundary integrals into the complex  arclength variable (or other suitable parametrization variable).   In this complex plane, singularities are born, depending on the  details of the initial conditions.  These singularities then  track through the complex plane, and may reach the real axis in  finite time.  At that point they become physically relevant.   Preliminary studies of the influence of surface tension show that  the singularities slow down and fail to reach the real axis in  finite time, but they get extremely close.  The close proximity  of these singularities to the real axis plagues standard  numerical methods, because of the high resolution needed to  capture the extremely distorted free-surface.  Instead, the  investigator uses a method that represents any singularities in  the complex plane explicitly, so that the rest of the behavior of  the free-surface is analytic.  In  particular, this analytic part  can be represented by Fourier series very accurately.  The first  task is to use this approach on a simpler classical free-surface  flow problem, the fingering instability in a Hele-Shaw cell.  The  second is to explore the method on the Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability of an interface between two incompressible fluids of  equal density and in the presence of surface tension.       Surfaces between immiscible liquids and gases occur  abundantly in nature and technology.  Some examples include the  rise of bubbles in chemically reacting units, falling rain-drops,  spray jets, and oil and water flowing in the ground.   Mathematical models that attempt to describe the motion of  surfaces typically exhibit great sensitivity to the details of  the motion.  Consequently, computer simulations can suffer from  inaccuracies unless extraordinary care is taken.  The  investigator develops a conceptually new mathematical approach  that will allow severely deformed geometries to be tracked  reliably.  In particular, the approach will be able to track the  long term behavior of water penetrating oil in a Hele-Shaw Cell,  a mathematically similar model for the motion of oil and water  during secondary stage recovery from an oil-field.  Once  completely understood on this important problem, the approach  will be adapted to the study of rising bubbles and dendritic  formation during crystal growth.  ***",
