The goal of the study is to examine cell  lineage of and differential gene expression in the olfactory  placodes of the frog, Xenopus laevis.  Cell lineage experiments  consist of injecting dyes into cells in the anterior neural plate,  and following the migration of injected cells with a SIT camera and  time-lapsed video recordings.  Likewise, the source of cells in  regenerating olfactory placodes will be determined.  Two genes  (distal-less and empty spiracles) known to be expressed in mouse  olfactory placodes will be characterized in Xenopus placodes.  The  pattern of expression of these genes will be determined with in  situ hybridization and Northern blots.  This study will determine  factors that regulate differentiation and regeneration of the  olfactory placodes.      Development of a fertilized egg into a multicellular organism is  controlled by an array of genes and tissue interactions that  determine the fates of particular cell and tissue types.  The goal  of this study is to examine developmental expression of genes and  the formation and regeneration of the peripheral tissue for the  sense of smell, the olfactory epithelium, in the frog.  Fluorescent  dyes will be injected into cells that are thought to form or reform  the olfactory placode, the precursor tissue to the olfactory  epithelium.  The long-term goal of this study is to determine the  molecular and cellular factors that regulate development and  regeneration in the developing nervous system, using the peripheral  olfactory system as a model.  ***",
