 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to establish pressure effects on enzyme             kinetics as a diagnostic of enzyme mechanism of the same sort as                initial rate kinetic studies at constant pressure have been for the             last 40 years or so.  Pressure effect studies on formate                        dehydrogenase will be correlated with isotope effect studies.  The              pressure effect kinetic expressions will be developed and compared              with the results obtained with a series of enzymes whose catalytic              mechanisms are presumed to be known.                                            %%%                                                                             Studies of the time-dependence of enzyme-catalyzed reactions as a               function of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor concentration have                 developed into a paradigm for characterizing catalytic mechanism                (ie. the timing of bond-making and bond-breaking events during the              converstion of substrate into products).  Understanding of enzyme               mechanism is important for developemnt of better substrates or                  inhibitors, etc.  Mechanism information is useful for understanding             how metabolism works and for the design of drugs and enzyme assays.             The study of pressure effects on enzyme catalysis has the potential             of developing into another powerful diagnostic of mechanism which               is both independent of and complementary to concentration-                      dependence studies.  The proposed work could provide revolutionary              new insights into enzyme function studies.",
