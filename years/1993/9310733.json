 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310733  Gartland       The investigator undertakes the mathematical and numerical  analysis of problems related to the science of liquid crystal  materials.  He continues interdisciplinary work with the Glenn H.  Brown Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University.   The primary focus of the project is on three areas: (1) numerical  minimization of the Landau-deGennes free energy for liquid  crystals (which involves tensor order parameters, finite-element  analysis, large-sparse optimization, and numerical bifurcation),  (2) automatic code generation for the finite-element analysis  of problems in liquid crystals (using modern computer  science technology from the area of symbolic and numeric  computing), and (3) numerical analysis and modeling of the optics  of display devices (involving the solution of Maxwell's equations  in nonhomogeneous birefringent media).       The study of liquid crystals is an area of materials  science that is rapidly growing in importance, driven primarily  by commercial applications in the display industry: watch  or calculator displays, notebook computer screens,  high-definition flat-panel TV screens, etc.  The Liquid Crystal  Institute at Kent State has a strong international reputation.   It is the only academically-based institute devoted solely to  research on liquid crystals, and it is the locus of the NSF  Science and Technology Center on \"Advanced Liquid Crystalline  Optical Materials\" (ALCOM). The investigator's research project  contributes to this activity in an interdisciplinary environment  involving physics and chemistry in addition to mathematics and  computer science.  He performs numerical simulations on current  problems of interest to the theoreticians and experimentalists in  the LCI.  He brings to bear state-of-the-art techniques from  modern numerical analysis and scientific computing to complement  theory and experiment. Investigators in the LCI are at their  limits, using sophisticated experimental techniques, in probing  the stru cture of liquid crystals in the very small (submicron)  size containments in certain display technologies currently under  development.  Also, the numerical simulation of the optical  properties of complicated liquid crystal devices (of the types  mentioned above) is in a rather primitive state of development.   The project's numerical work plays an important role in these  areas.  ***",
