A  Northwestern Memorial Hospital Network (NMHNET) connection to the  Internet would provide a critical service as Northwestern Memorial  Hospital (NMH) moves forward in the delivery of care to our  patients and the support of research and education.  NMH has deployed a high speed network over the last several years.   NMH is continuing this substantial investment with a new high  performance, TCP/IP network infrastructure to support advanced  clinical applications such as: clinical decision support systems,  diagnostic imaging and the creation of electronic patient records.  This grant request will provide over the two years a connection to  the Internet with the appropriate hardware and an opportunity to  improve patient care, research and education at Northwestern  Memorial Hospital.  NMH needs to provide a connection for hospital clinicians,  researchers and educators to communicate with NIH, NLM,  Supercomputers in Champaign, IL, and colleagues and co-  investigators across the nation via E-Mail.  We must remove these  barriers in order to enhance our support of patient care, research  and education.  The connection of NMHNET to the Internet is a vital link to our  clinicians, researchers and educators.  These initiatives being  undertaken with our partners at Northwestern University Medical  School (NUMS) constitute the development of a highly advanced  medical center network providing services to our diverse clinical,  research and academic staffs.  ***",
