 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223637  King    Nearly everyone who has ever done quantitative analysis in  political science has come across the problem of needing data where  none exist.  One might have found the right survey, but it is  missing a critical question.  A researcher may have data on U.S  states, but not all the information is known for all states.   Likewise, a researcher may have data on the cities but not the rest  of the United States.      The investigators study one important aspect of this problem:   handling missing data in the analysis of a dataset organized as a  time series of cross-sections; a problem for which no adequate  solution presently exist.  This problem arose as an important  obstacle in two distinct areas of the substantive research  undertaken by the investigators, one involving data comprising a  series of presidential \"trial heat\" polls and, the other, a large  quantity of legilslative electoral data.  In searching for a  solution, the investigators found that the problem is much more  general and has arisen at least implicitly in statistics, political  methodology, and numerous areas of substantive research in  political science and elsewhere.  The researchers plan to  generalize the existing statistical method of \"multiple  imputation,\" simulating data mathematically, to deal with data such  as these.  ***",
