The researchers see these topics as closely                                     related in aims and techniques and believe the                                  major problems in all three areas have the same                                 character as the famous \"P versus NP\" problem                                   (whether there is a propositional proof system                                  in which every tautology has a proof whose                                      length is polynomial in the length of the                                       tautology.)                                                                                                                                                     In their investigation of elicit connections,                                   the researchers will study the following                                        problems:  finite axiomatizability                                              of bounded arithmetic, lower bounds to the                                      depth and to the size of Boolean circuits,                                      bounds on the length of Frege, extended Frege                                   and first-order proofs.  Results are expected                                   to help determine whether some methods                                          developed purely for logic can be applied to                                    problems in complexity theory.                                                                                                                                  This research in mathematics fulfills the                                       program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    U.S. and Czech Republic to combine                                              complementary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.  Funds for the project are                                      awarded through the US-Czech Joint Fund,                                        Prague, in accordance with established                                          guidelines.",
