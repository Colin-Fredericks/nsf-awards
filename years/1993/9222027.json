 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to identify all the                        neurotrophic or neuronal cell survival factors active during                    development of the inner ear.  Neurotrophic factors are essential               for survival and development of most if not all neurons.  They have             thus far been studied individually relative to a given population               of neurons.  At this point, few studies have probed the issue of                whether multiple factors may be active on the same group of cells               either at the same time or at different time points during                      development.  This is a  potentially important avenue of                        investigation that will be pursued in the present project.  This                laboratory has previously shown that neurons of the inner ear can               respond to nerve growth factor (NGF), one member of a family of                 neurotrophic factors.  This new project will focus on other members             of this family of  molecules.  The initial studies will focus on                when during embryonic development binding sites for the other                   members of the NGF family appear on the neurons of the inner ear.               The presence of binding sites for a molecule is necessary for a                 nerve cell to be able to respond to that molecule.  Subsequent                  studies will determine when the factors themselves appear during                development.  Although binding sites are a prerequisite for a                   response, the factor itself must be present in the embryo in order              to elicit and effect.  This project will yield a more complete                  picture of the multiple influences responsible for development of               a neuron. ***//",
