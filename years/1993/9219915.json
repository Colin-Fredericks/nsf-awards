 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219915  Brown         The Ural Mountains of central Russia form a 3,000-km linear  orogenic belt of Paleozoic age and constitute a unique natural  laboratory to address a number of basic issues concerning  collisional orogenesis and the evolution of continental crust.   Several features appear to distinguish the Urals from other  Paleozoic orogenic belts such as the Appalachians, Caledonides, and  Variscides.  Primary among these are (1) the apparent presence  (based on seismic velocities) of a preserved crustal root below the  Urals, (2) the apparent lack of syn- or post-collisional collapse  evidenced in the Urals based on existing data, (3) the relatively  shallow crustal level and generally low metamorphic grade exposed  in the Urals, and (4) the nature and distribution of crustal  reflectivity in the Ural orogen.  In particular, the apparent  similarity in early orogenic evolution between the Urals and the  Appalachians, and the subsequent divergence in post-orogenic paths,  offer a special opportunity to evaluate the role of various  orogenic processes in the development of lower crustal structure.   For example, if the prominent lower crustal layering observed  beneath the Appalachian interior relates to post-orogenic  extension, will it be absent beneath the  Urals?  Do the Urals  preserve an intermediate stage in orogenic development between the  more mature collapsed orogens like the Appalachians and more recent  compressional belts like the Alps and Himalayas?         The Principal Investigators will initiate a collaborative  research program with Russian scientists at the Bazhenov  Geophysical Expedition in Scheelite (near Ekaterinburg, formerly  Sverdlovsk), Russia, for a comprehensive study of the nature and  origin of the crustal structure of the Urals based on their  extensive existing geophysical database.  This  collaboration  constitutes the initial phase of a larger, long-term program to  compare and contrast the Urals with other Paleozoic orogens,  eventually leading to the  first deep seismic reflection profile  across the Urals.  This effort also represents the first  collaboration between US scientists and EUROPROBE, a major new  European initiative to coordinate lithospheric studies in Europe.   The US component will focus on a comparison of Uralian and  Appalachian structure, complementing EUROPROBE's investigation of  the Urals versus Variscan evolution.         In particular they will focus on reprocessing and synthesis  of Russia reflection (mostly shallow), refraction and DSS (deep  seismic sounding) data, with the aim of mapping the crustal  structure and understanding the Phanerozoic history of the Urals  and nearby regions.  In doing this, they will be establishing with  their Russian collaborators a common knowledge of the various  existing datasets and their interpretations.         It is important to note that the Bazhenov Expedition is the  center for all geophysical data available on the Urals (including  DSS and reflection data, gravity and magnetic data, heat flow,  etc.) and the majority of these data, are of unrestricted access  under the conditions of a joint statement with scientists from that  institute.  ***",
