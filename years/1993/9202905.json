 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will provide funding for participation by a team of               experts from the U.S. in an international study of acoustically                 significant rooms in North America.  Objectives of the research                 are:                                                                            1. The acoustical conditions in many significant rooms in North                 America will be characterized in detail by the new measures of                  acoustical quality.                                                             2. Comparisons of the simultaneous measurements made by three                   research teams will test the acceptability of the draft of ISO 3382             standard for the new impulse response type of acoustical                        measurements regarding many specifics of the data acquisition and               analysis process.                                                               3. The comparisons of the different measurement techniques would                also allow the extensive data base of detailed acoustical                       measurements for the statistical modeling of room acoustics with                the architectural properties of the rooms on an unprecedented                   scale.  These models based on an extremely large sample would                   provide a deeper understanding of the build-up and decay of sounds              in complex rooms and the fundamental relationships among acoustical             measurements and architectural properties of rooms.                             4. High quality impulse responses from multiple source and receiver             locations would be gathered in each room studied.                                                                                                               The results of this research will have a major and immediate impact             on the state of architectural acoustics.  the scientific basis for              acoustical decision-making in the design of buildings will be                   greatly expanded.  The active participation of the acoustical                   consulting community (evidenced by their financial support of the               project) would also allow for the rapid translation of the research             results into everyday design practice.",
