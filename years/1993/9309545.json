 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309545  White         One of the most basic needs of a complex organism is the  maintenance of nutrient and energy homeostasis, a process which  requires coordination of nutrient, hormonal, and neuronal signals  to integrate metabolism with behavior.  Food intake, appetite and  body weight are controlled by the brain through an interaction with  peripheral signals.  This interaction is complex and poorly  understood even though it is of obvious importance.  Recently, it  has been discovered that a peptide in the brain, neuropeptide Y,  induces feeding when injected into specific nuclei of the  hypothalamus.  Indeed neuropeptide Y is one of the most abundant  peptides and is one of the most potent stimulants of food intake in  satiated mammals.  During his previous NSF support, Dr. White  demonstrated that neuropeptide Y is an integral link in the  communication between the periphery and the brain for regulating  energy homeostasis and food intake.  He will now determine the  means by which neuropeptide Y gene expression in the hypothalamus  and pituitary is directly responsive to peripheral hormones  regulating metabolism, i.e. insulin, glucocorticoids and thyroid  hormone.  Dr. White will examine how much neuropeptide Y is formed  under various experimental conditions that manipulate peripheral  hormone levels.  These studies of neuropeptide Y gene regulation by  the peripheral hormones will provide valuable information about the  physiological role of this peptide in integrating metabolic signals  important in energy homeostasis, food intake and body weight  regulation with neuroendocrine function of the hypothalamus.  These  studies can serve as a basis for understanding how such regulatory  systems become disturbed in physiologies such as obesity and  anorexia nervosa and may lead to development of therapies for  controlling human eating disorders.   Indeed, Dr. White in  collaboration with others in the Division of Endocrinology,  submitted New Technology Disclosures for the use of specifi c diet  formulations for the treatment of morbid obesity and for the  stimulation of growth hormone secretion in growth hormone-  suppressed individuals through the manipulations of specific brain  neuropeptide systems.    ***",
