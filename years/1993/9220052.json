 "awd_abstract_narration": "Measurements of the peculiar motions of galaxies are proving to                 be one of our most direct probes of the large-scale distribution                of matter in the local universe.  This information bears on a                   variety of issues, including the amount and nature of dark matter               and the birth and evolution of structure in the universe in the                 context of the big bang model.  The research to be conducted with               this grant will involve an observational program to measure                     improved distances to galaxies.  This will provide peculiar                     motions of unprecedented accuracy for a sample of hundreds of                   galaxies spread over a significant volume of space.  The                        availability of such data should allow a much more detailed and                 relatively bias-free map of the distribution of dark matter.                    Such a map is essential for evaluating the ability of numerical                 models of structure formation to simulate the real universe, and,               through comparison with maps of the distribution of luminous                    galaxies, instructive as to the process of galaxy formation.                                                                                                    The Principal Investigator is highly regarded for his research in               this area.",
