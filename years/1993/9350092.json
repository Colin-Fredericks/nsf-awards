The self-             study will begin with a review of current practices including                   goals, available equipment and technology, community resources,                 teacher qualifications, model programs, and others.  New data will              be gathered from the broad community through surveys, interviews,               and observations.  The data will be carefully analyzed and                      recommendations for improvement made by the Steering Committee.                 Public fora will be held in the city to share the data and                      recommendations and to gather comments on them to be included in a              final set of recommendations and a plan for improvement of science              and mathematics education based upon the data and recommendations.
