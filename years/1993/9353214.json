All are part of Bank Street's Liberty  partnership program, a New York State-funded comprehensive college  preparatory program that stresses prevention through early  intervention.    LESA's residential, 20-day, intensive summer science experience  will take place at Bard College.  Developed and coordinated by the  Bronx Botanical Garden's Institute of Ecological Studies (IES),  field investigation will alternate yearly between a terrestrial and  an aquatic ecology focus.  Outdoor Biological Instructional  Strategies (OBIS) investigations will familiarize students with  organisms and their environments with activities centered on the  physical environment, aquatic environments, and organisms, plants,  insects, and other invertebrates, birds, and mammals.  Mathematics  will be continually integrated into activities.  Students will  attend \"Writing to Learn Mathematics and Science,\" and receive  career counseling.    During the school year, weekly Saturday Environmental Science  Clusters at Bank Street will involve LESA students in accessing  Learning Link, a national electronic network; using the Center for  Children and Technology's NSF-sponsored Imagine, a computer-based  environment; and participating in Wave Hill's natural area  restoration project.",
