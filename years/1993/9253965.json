 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Indiana University SOCRATES PROJECT is contributing to a                    critically needed national improvement in university                            introductory physics education through research on and                          development of interactive engagement methods for cost-                         effective mastery learning. In particular, this project is                      further developing, improving, and promulgating the Socratic                    Dialogue Inducing (SDI) Lab method which has been shown to be                   effective in promoting student crossover to the Newtonian                       World.  The focus is on mechanics and related areas (fluid                      statics and dynamics, oscillations, and waves). The testing                     ground is the Indiana University Physics Department's General                   Physics I, a large-enrollment, non-calculus based course for                    science (but not physics) majors (including prospective high-                   and middle-school teachers).  \"Real-world\" in-class                             investigation, well-controlled out-of-class research with paid                  student subjects, and in-depth case studies are being utilized.                 The goals sought are to (1) improve and systematize the                         Socratic-dialogue and SDI lab techniques; (2) collaborate with                  other instructors to modify the SDI method for various                          instructional settings; (3) improve and extend the laboratory                   modules and instructor's guides; (4) more widely disseminate                    the method by means of publications, talks, workshops, and                      distribution of videotapes and lab modules; and (5) continue                    the construction of computer Force-Motion-Vector Animations to                  assist laboratory and lecture instruction.***//",
