 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project assembles historical measures of soil degradation                  and its effects on agricultural productivity in India and China,                countries containing 44 percent of the population of all                        developing nations.  Now that population growth is near the                     fastest rate in all history, how fast is productive land being                  lost to erosion, aggradation, salinity, alkalinity, and cities?                 How fast has the net soil loss really been?  How much has it                    cost?  The techniques developed here can become a model for                     solving other debates over trends in soil quality.                                                                                                              Most estimates of soil degradation are erosion estimates.  These                estimates suggest enormous losses.  For example, it is estimated                that rivers carry 24 billion tons of sediment to the ocean each                 year, compared with only 9 billion tons before the introduction                 of agriculture, grazing and other human activities.  But such                   studies give gross measures of soil loss, not the net measures                  that are closer to the productivity measures needed in order to                 assess the productivity effects of erosion.  These measures lack                information on the earlier amount and quality of soil, for                      comparison with water levels.  Instead of a chain of snapshots                  over time, we are asked to judge movement from a single snapshot.               In contrast, this project assembles and analyzes six main data                  sets on soil qualities and agricultural productivity in China                   from the 1930s to the 1980s and three main data sets for land                   quality in India from 1950 to 1984.  Considerable time is spent                 on direct comparisons of soil data from cultivated lands within                 each county in China and India.  The productivity consequences of               land attributes will be estimated from these data.  Finally a                   range of related hypotheses about land tenure and the role of                   specific policies will be rigorously tested.",
