These include the transportation (airlines,  cruise ships), lodging (hotels, resorts), fashion, and seasonal  manufacturing and retailing industries. Because of long lead times  capacity can be considered fixed, at least in the short run, and  its cost sunk. The relatively low marginal costs of providing goods  or services within capacity makes revenue maximization a main  concern for these industries. Effective temporal pricing and  allocation decisions can significantly increase revenues in these  industries and hence strengthen their competitive positions. At  present there is a wealth of reservation and point-of-sale data  which can be used to make temporal pricing and allocation  decisions. The goal of this research is to develop theoretical and  practical temporal pricing and allocation methods that take full  advantage of these data.  This research develops modeling  techniques and algorithms that capture realistic and complex  multiple product problems.  The framework will ultimately be  capable of handling extremely complicated problems such as pricing  and allocating the capacity of an entire airline carrier network  over multiple markets.  Also planned is a study of joint pricing,  allocation, and demand estimation, an essential building block for  the future implementation of the research. Toward this end, an  initial program of empirical studies in conjunction with a major  fashion retailer is also proposed to secure financial and in-kind  support from both the retail and airline industry for continued  funding of the research.  ***",
