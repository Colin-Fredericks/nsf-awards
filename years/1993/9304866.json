 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromosomes of eukaryotes have regions of differing                        compaction termed heterochromatin and euchromatin. Heterochromatin              has a high density of repetitious DNA, few genes and little                     transcription. Active genes, most of which are found in the                     euchromatin, are inactivated if they are removed to heterochromatic             regions. This effect, called position effect variegation (PEV), has             been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly.             There is evidence that the telomeric regions at the ends of                     eukaryotic chromosomes are specialized heterochromatic-like                     domains. The project proposed uses telomeric PEV in Drosophila to               investigate telomeric chromatin by identification of telomeric non-             histone proteins and telomeric DNA sequences which bind those                   proteins. A white eye color gene flanked by telomeric sequences                 will be integrated at non-telomeric locations and the expression of             that gene with and without the telomeric sequences will be                      compared. A second approach will be to localize the DNA sequences               necessary and/or sufficient to bind HP1, a protein characterized in             other laboratories, which is implicated in chromatin condensation.              %%%                                                                             The primary objective of this project is to identify telomeric                  proteins and the DNA sequences to which they bind, but the                      resulting data will also be relevant to the broader question of how             gene expression is regulated by chromosome condensation. Such a                 mechanism is thought to be critical to normal development of                    eukaryotic organisms.",
