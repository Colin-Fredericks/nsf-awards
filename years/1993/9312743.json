 "awd_abstract_narration": "This support will enable installation and implementation of a                   prototype distributed system to network and provide virtual access              to biodiversity databases associated with 6 fish collections:                   Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology, the California Academy of              Sciences, Academy of Natural Sciences (Philadelphia), University of             Michigan Museum of Zoology, University of Alabama, and the Field                Museum of Natural History (Chicago).  The system will utilize                   Gopher software technology running via a client-server architecture             over the Internet.  At each institution the awardee will (a)                    install a Sun workstation on Ethernet and configure it with the Sun             operating system and Gopher server software; (b) reformat the                   database text file (using custom UNIX and Perl scripts) for the                 Gopher server; (c) train local staff in UNIX system and Gopher                  software management and provide system management over the Internet             for one year.  Access to the database files over Gopher will be                 read only, for security reasons, and each institution will choose               the accessible content of the database.  This prototype project                 will demonstrate to the national collections community the ease,                security and affordability of sharing biodiversity data bound up in             museum and herbarium collections as well as associated authority                files. The need for and potential impact of such a demonstration                project was stressed at the US Government-sponsored International               Workshop on Biodiversity Inventory, Survey and Data Management in               January, 1993.  Gopher has become the de facto standard for                     networked research and academic computing worldwide because it is               platform independent, operates on TCP/IP networks, incorporates                 public domain WAIS software for creating full text indices, and                 uses simple, powerful client-server architecture.  It is                        opportunistic and cost-effective now to marry this current                      technology to information management needs in museums and herbaria.             Successful networking of collection databases can achieve great                 economies of scale in capturing collection data in the same                     discipline at different institutions, in using authority files to               standardize the data dictionary, and in providing biodiversity data             sets for research, conservation and educational endeavors.                      %%%                                                                             This support will enable installation and implementation of a                   prototype system to network and provide access to biodiversity                  databases associated with 6 fish collections at Harvard's Museum of             Comparative Zoology, the California Academy of Sciences, Academy of             Natural Sciences (Philadelphia), University of Michigan Museum of               Zoology, University of Alabama, and the Field Museum of Natural                 History (Chicago).
