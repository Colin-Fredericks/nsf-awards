The workshop will examine             conservation problems and develop remedial strategies. A task force             will be established to oversee the field testing of these                       strategies after the conference. The approaches, methodologies and              solutions discussed at the conference will have important                       applications pertaining to a wide range of organisms. The                       conference will contain a blend of participants including                       ecologists, conservationists, planners, and governmental                        representatives. The proceedings of the conference will be                      published.                                                                      %%%                                                                             This conference is an important, timely, creative, and                          cost-effective forum for the discussion and dissemination of                    information regarding the conservation, restoration, and management             of chelonian species. The results of the conference will also yield             important implications for conservation biology, in general.",
