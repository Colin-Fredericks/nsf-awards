 "awd_abstract_narration": "This series of annual Summer Institutes in Game Theory and                      Economics is designed to stimulate and disseminate new advances in              research on game theory and its applications and to make conceptual             and methodological developments in game theory available to an                  expanding group of scientists in economics and other disciplines.               Each year the month-long program of research-oriented conferences               and workshops and an intensive course of instruction on a topic of              major significance, complemented by a further period of informal                research activities, will bring together a large international                  group of researchers - a mix of established scholars, junior                    faculty, and graduate students - whose interests represent a                    diverse array of theoretical and applied aspects of game theory.                                                                                                The programs proposed for 1993-1995 are a continuation of the                   series of Summer Institutes held at Stonybrook in 1990, 1991, and               1992, each of which attracted more than 200 participants.  Formal               activities include a five-day conference with plenary and parallel              sessions, and invited and contributed papers; two weeks of                      workshops on selected themes; and one to two weeks of intensive                 instruction on selected topics.  The value of this format and                   approach is evidenced by the success of the previous Institutes.",
