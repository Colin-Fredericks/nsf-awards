 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics curriculum reform has no significant effect on                 what and how students learn unless classroom teachers learn about               newly developed ideas and methods and get support for integrating               them into their teaching.  Results of the Phase I Small Business                Innovation Research (SBIR) study establish the technical basis                  for a model of teacher inservice offering not only training and                 follow-up but ongoing support.  The results also demonstrate that               there is an important opportunity for publishers of educational                 materials to play a key role in providing inservice support for                 their innovative materials which in turn support adherence to the               National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) Curriculum and               Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.  The objectives of                 the Phase II research focus on (1) continuing to develop and test               a professional development model; (2) extending the range of                    professional development workshops and institutes both                          geographically and beyond its Phase I substantive focus on                      geometry; (3) creating a series of videos that can be used to                   provide or supplement professional development workshops; (4)                   starting professional development leadership workshops cum                      associated materials; (5) publishing a newsletter on professional               development in secondary mathematics for workshop leaders,                      teachers, and mathematics supervisors; and (6) disseminating                    findings from Phases I and II.  The project aims to prepare large               numbers of teachers to use innovative materials effectively; to                 apply its inservice mode in more schools in a variety of settings               (urban, suburban, rural); to propagate the successful                           professional development mode to other areas of mathematics                     education: problem solving, calculus, the core mathematics                      curriculum, and probability and statistics; to disseminate                      inservice economically and profitably, to research ways                         technology can be employed; and to promote effective integration                of innovative technology tools such as computer software and                    graphing calculators into mathematics teaching.                                                                                                                 The project will contribute to the facilitation of sound                        curriculum change based on the premise that teachers are the key                to producing change in the classroom and professional development               is the key to reaching teachers with new ideas, content, methods                and materials.",
