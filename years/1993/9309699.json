 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309699  Scheinkman    This project consists of two parts: (1) the study of dynamic  problems with irreversibilities similar to the dynamic decision  making problems encountered in negotiating international  agreements to avoid future environmental catastrophes, and (2)  the development of methods to evaluate and estimate nonlinear  continuous time models using discrete time data from financial  markets.  The two parts of the project are related in that the  methods used to study environmental irreversibilities are  extensions and applications of the models developed for financial  markets.      Much of the research on biodiversity, ozone depletion and other  aspects of environmental policy focuses on the irreversibility of  certain actions that alter the environment.  Part of this project  develops new mathematical tools to study the effects of  irreversibilities like those present in many environmental  questions, on dynamic problems.  This research should provide  theoretical insights as well as numerical methods that could be  helpful in evaluating the value of environmental preservation.    Continuous time formulations been used to produce theoretical  insights in a variety of questions in finance and economics and  are also used, in practice, to yield pricing and hedging  strategies in financial markets.  Much less has been done to  develop methods to evaluate and estimate these models when only  discrete time observations are available, as is the case in  economic applications.  Part of this project aims at filling this  gap by developing a series of methods to evaluate nonlinear  continuous time models using discrete time data.  The research  will provide theoretical justification for the proposed methods,  and also use them to evaluate alternative models of the  determination of securities prices.  The objective is to increase  our understanding of several of the determinants of securities  prices and their volatility.  ***",
