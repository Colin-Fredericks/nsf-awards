Sanchez of the University of Texas at  Austin, and Prof. Jose L. Moran-Lopez of the Universidad  Autonoma de San Luis de Potosi, Mexico, has as primary  objectives to provide an up-to-date and in-depth review of the  subject; foster the direct interaction between U.S., European, and  Latin American scientists; and explore areas of common interest in  magnetic materials between the common interest in magnetic  materials between the Latin American and U.S. communities.  The  workshop will involve the participation of approximately 30 leading  authorities in magnetic materials and magnetism from the U.S.,  Europe and Latin America.    The workshop addresses an area of significant current interest in  terms of fundamental aspects and technological issues.  The advent  of new materials, advanced processing and synthesis techniques,  and new characterization methodologies have set a brisk pace of  development in this area.  All participants are likely to benefit from  the interaction with researchers having a broad range in the subject  of magnetism and magnetic materials.  ***",
