 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of the proposed project is the development of             a creative approach to the teaching of sophomore-level engineering              mechanics courses which stimulates the students' thinking beyond a              problem-solving level and helps students overcome fundamental                   deficiencies in their ability to conceptualize problems.  The                   stimuli is to be supplied by adding both visual and hands-on                    components to the teaching and learning experience, two components              which are known to be critical in the retention of learned                      material.  Specifically, there are three distinct, yet                          interrelated, components to this proposal:  development of                      graphical software emphasizing the visualization of relationships               such as load distribution is static systems and force/motion                    relationships in dynamical systems:  design and development of a                mechanics toolbox consisting of basic building block components for             individual experimentation by the students; and the development of              more sophisticated in-class experimental demonstrations emphasizing             the relations between qualitative and quantitative perspectives of              static and dynamical systems.  The immediate impact of these                    learning tools will be that students develop an improved physical               insight, engineering relevancy and spatial visualization of                     mechanics problems.  The long range impact of the usage of these                tools will be to help capture the interest of the students at an                early stage of their education thereby fostering an increased                   interest and enthusiasm in engineering.  In addition, the proposed              work will allow for exploration of problems from a perspective                  which encourages inductive learning, a learning style which is more             natural for the students than the traditional deductive style.                  Critical review and evaluation of the proposed work will be                     conducted through formative evaluations by participating students               and faculty, through a 2nd year evaluation workshop using external              reviewers, and through quasi-experimental testing of student                    performance and long-term retention.  Finally, deliverables from                this work will be in the form of graphical software from the                    visualization component, a working mechanics toolbox set and                    development of experimental in-class demonstrations.  These                     deliverables along with the pedological contributions of the                    research will be disseminated through technical publications, a                 summer workshop during the third year and a videotape summary of                the project.",
