 "awd_abstract_narration": "This disparity in interest and achievement in mathematics                       and science between white male students and female and                          minority students is a problem that needs to be addressed.                      At a three day conference in July 1993, Luther College will                     bring together college educators from Lutheran Colleges                         across the United States and elementary and secondary                           educators from Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin to examine                         current research findings on this topic.                                                                                                                        Two hundred participants will be introduced to materials and                    pedagogical methods designed to remove the disparity in                         student interest and achievement.  Presentations will focus                     on changing classroom activities from elementary through                        college instruction including teacher education.  The goal                      is that the event will serve as a resource that will enable                     educators at all levels:                                                                                                                                        *  to understand the causes of the disparities math science                      achievement and interest among student populations.                                                                                                            *  to implement teaching methods and materials that remove                         obstacles and disincentives that can cause disparities in                      achievement and interest.                                                                                                                                     *  to motivate more female and minority-group students to                          pursue careers in mathematics and science.
