 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves an extended series of EPR and optical                    experiments on S=1 linear antiferromagnetic chains in a variety of              different materials.  These chains which when closed have a singlet             ground state and a gap in their excitation spectrum (the Haldane                gap) are representative of the strong current interest in quantum               disordered ground states.  Open chains have the very novel property             of displaying fractional spin, S=1/2, (spinons) at the chain ends.              Electron- nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) will be used to map out              the spatial distribution of the spin 1/2 on the sites extending in              from the chain ends.  Breaks in the chains and resulting open ends              with spinons will be created by substituting small amounts of non-              magnetic ions for the Ni ions(S=1) in a variety of organic and                  inorganic compounds with Ni chains.  Efforts will also be made to               create these chain breaks by optically pumping some of the Ni ions              out of their ground state.  In this way chain lengths can be varied             by changing the light intensity and interaction between the spinons             may be observed.  In addition Raman scattering is underway with                 collaborators at The Francis Bitter lab to measure the Haldane gap              at k=0 to help resolve some of the important questions involving                its nature and magnitude relative to the gap at k=..                            %%%                                                                             The magnetic behavior of compounds in which the magnetic centers                are arrayed in chains with negligible interaction between the                   chains represents an intersection of a forefront topic in                       theoretical magnetism with creative materials synthesis.  Until                 recently such ideal chain compounds did not exist as it was                     difficult to keep the magnetic chains far enough apart to inhibit               interaction among the chains, ultimately resulting in three                     dimensional magnetic behavior.  However, new materials have been                synthesized in recent years which display this ideal one-                       dimensional magnetic behavior.  The principal investigator works                closely with materials scientists at AT&T Bell Laboratories who are             creating these materials for the experiments mentioned above.  It               is hoped that an enhanced understanding of these one dimensional                systems will lead to further insight into two-dimensional systems               and by extension to high temperature superconductivity.",
