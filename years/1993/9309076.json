Such a central                    database is a critical bottleneck preventing the extensibility of               the CAD system over time, and forcing all design tools to work on               the same (comprehensive and hence extremely complex) data model.                Clearly, there is a conflict between supplying design tools with                customized design representations and integrating design data                   into one uniform model.  This research effort addresses this                    problem by extending OODB technology by two advanced features:                  (1) design views and (2) schema change support.  To support                     customized design representations, mechanisms to manage                         individualized tool interfaces of the CAD database are being                    implemented (which free individual design tools from having to                  maintain mappings between the global data model and local design                views). To support the extensibility of the CAD system, the view                system will be augmented with schema change functionality. It is                this unique integration of both capabilities that makes the                     Object-Oriented Extensible View System (OOEVS) a radically new                  tool for supporting CAD applications. Extensive experiments will                be performed to evaluate OOEVS and its application for building                 complex software systems (in particular, CAD systems).  The                     proposed research is significant in that it provides a solution                 to the important problem of CAD tool integration and extends                    state-of-the-art databases with powerful functionalities.",
