We will establish three new computerized laboratory  workstations consisting of a GC/MS, a IR spectrometer and a 486  computer containing tutorials and environmental software. These  workstations will greatly enhance the undergraduate laboratory  experience for students learning analytical methods, chemistry, and  environmental fate of compounds. The GC/MS and IR are well suited  for this endeavor since together they can effectively analyze the  majority of OSHA and EPA regulated pollutants. The development plan  features hands on experience, instruction in principles of GC/MS  and IR spectrometry, interpretation of spectra, analytical  techniques, and applications. Specific experiments will be  conducted to allow comparison of conventional GC, GC/MS and IR  techniques. Analysis for atmospheric gases, vapors and priority  pollutants will be covered, so they may be used as investigative  tools in research topics and result in scholarly works with  undergraduate coauthors. Since chemistry, biology and environmental  science students will take laboratory courses using these  workstations, the project will impact a significant number of  students.    i",
