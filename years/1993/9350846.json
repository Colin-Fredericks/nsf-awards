The Hewlett-Packard MS  Engine has a modern data system capable of true multi-tasking  and four attached personal computers allowing exposure of large  numbers of students to practical modern mass spectrometry.  The  degree of exposure and \"hands on\" use of the instrument  increases from the sophomore to the senior level.  Initial  student contact with the instrument is in the organic  laboratory where students are identifying the products of  simple synthetic reactions.  In physical chemistry, the  concepts of bond formation and reaction mechanisms are being  studied through ion-molecule reactions.  In the inorganic labs,  students routinely are using the instrument to analyze the  products of their inorganic syntheses, while in the analytical  laboratories, quantitative analysis of chlorinated hydrocarbons  and polychlorinated biphenyls is being carried out on water and  soil samples collected throughout the state.  Finally, students  are using the mass spectrometer in a number of undergraduate  research projects.  Careful choice of experiments, efficient  use of instrument time, and easy data access through multiple  computers are enabling us to expose large numbers of students  to practical \"hands on\" mass spectrometry.  A review of the  literature shows a marked deficiency in teaching mass  spectrometry at the undergraduate level.  This project is  providing a model for correcting that problem.  ***",
