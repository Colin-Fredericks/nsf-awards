 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Marin S. Robinson has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Robinson's doctoral degree was                     from the University of Colorado/Boulder under the supervision                   of Professor Charles DePuy. Dr. Robinson will continue research                 at the University of Colorado/Boulder under the sponsorship of                  Professor Margaret Tolbert. Dr. Robinson's postdoctoral                         position will provide her the opportunity to construct a flow                   tube apparatus and study heterogeneous processes between gas                    phase molecules and metal surfaces. Longer term, she plans to                   apply her postdoctoral experience to the study of chemical                      reactivity of ion-molecules and ion-radicals on model ice                       surfaces and metal surfaces. These studies will advance our                     fundamental understanding of both atmospheric chemistry and                     catalysis by metals.                                                            %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                      broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                  and teaching.",
