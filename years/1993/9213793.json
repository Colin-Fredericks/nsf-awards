 "awd_abstract_narration": "Theoretical studies will be conducted on localization problems                  associated with the propagation of light in crystals.  In                       particular, research will be done on (1) band structure and                     localized impurity modes associated with the propagation of                     electromagnetic waves in two- and three-dimensional periodic                    dielectric media; (2) transverse Anderson localization effects                  associated with the propagation of electromagnetic waves in random              dielectric media; and, (3) localization effects in the heat                     conductivity associated with the propagation of acoustic waves in               amorphous materials.  The band structure and impurity mode spectra              of periodic dielectric media are of potential importance in the                 development of laser and solar cell technologies.  On the other                 hand, fundamental studies of classical waves propagating in random              media offer the opportunity for the prediction of new Anderson                  localization related phenomena which do not have complications                  associated with self-interactions of the system excitations.                    %%%                                                                             The theoretical research will study the propagation of                          electromagnetic waves, such as light, through media of different                dimensionalities and structure.  These different media can cause                the light to behave in strange ways such as bunching in specific                regions.  Effects such as these are of fundamental interest in                  condensed matter physics and are also of interest to the technology             of photonics.",
