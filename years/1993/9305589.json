 "awd_abstract_narration": "In April 1992, a team consisting of David Applegate of                     AT&T Bell Laboratories, Robert Bixby of Rice University, Vasek                  Chvatal of Rutgers University, and William Cook of Bellcore                     established a new world record by solving ten previously                        unsolved problems, with sizes ranging from 1,060 to 3,038                       cities, from a standard library of test data called TSPLib.                     (In particular, the 3,038-city problem is the largest TSPLib                    instance ever solved.)  The task of writing up an exposition                    of the new algorithm is overwhelming: the program, developed                    by four people in the course of four years has some 50                          thousand lines not counting the part that implements the                        simplex method.  The award is so that Chvatal can buy himself                   out of his teaching duties at Rutgers for the Spring term of                    1993 in order to dedicate himself full-time to writing in                       constant consultations with his colleagues at AT&T Bell Labs                    in Murray Hills, NJ and Bellcore in Morristown, NJ.",
