 "awd_abstract_narration": "Superhard refractory materials have important applications in                   metal shaping equipment and heat engines due to their high-                     temperature properties.  However, these desirable engineering                   properties are major obstacles to the fabrication of useful                     shapes.  In addition they suffer from low fracture toughness as                 compared to metals.                                                                                                                                             Conventional processing methods at or near equilibrium conditions               are limited with respect to peak pressure and temperature                       capability.  They are also very limited in their capability to                  produce heat-treatable ceramic composites.                                                                                                                      We propose to apply a non-equilibrium method for consolidation of               silicon carbide composites containing an electrically conductive                phase.  In this process a fine powder mixture is subjected to                   mechanical pressure and an intense current pulse with a duration                that is typically less than a millisecond.  Under these                         conditions the conductive phase is melted and alloyed with the                  silicon carbide phase with a minimum of heat loss to the                        containment structure.  The rapid cooling of the compact is                     expected to result in a heat-treatable solid solution or                        extremely fine microstructure.                                                  %%%                                                                             The materials under development are applicable to cutting tools,                dies, armor, and wear components.",
