 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a combination of economics and the psychology of               decision making.  The basic decision making problem studied is                  repeated decisions made under conditions of risk.  How do people                evaluate a risky decision or investment decision which is one of a              sequence of such decisions?  The answer turns on three issues:  How             they evaluate single trials (or decisions), how they aggregate the              trials over time, and how they estimate the cumulative distribution             of outcomes.  The combination of these three processes is shown to              produce myopic loss aversion -- the tendency to overweight the                  chance of losing on a single trial.  This concept of myopic loss                aversion is used to try to explain the so-called equity premium                 puzzle.  The equity premium puzzle refers to the fact that stocks               have earned much higher returns than bonds in the last century, and             the difference is difficult to explain within the standard economic             framework.  The solution investigated in this project implies that              investors evaluate their portfolios annually, even though they                  usually have a much longer investment horizon.  If evaluation                   horizons were longer, then the equity premium would shrink.",
