 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal U.S. participants in this project are Prof.                       Peter Tandy of Kent State University and Dr. Craig Roberts of                   Argonne National Laboratory. Also associated with the project are               Dr. Michael Frank from Hampton University and Dr. David Kahana,                 an NSF-supported post-doctoral associate at Kent State                          University. The primary Australian participants are Prof.                       Bruce McKellar of the University of Melbourne and Dr.                           Reginald Cahill of the Flinders University of South Australia.                  This award will provide travel support over a two year period                   for the American participants to visit the laboratories of the                  Australian colleagues.                                                                                                                                          The cooperative research to be undertaken is in the area of                     non-perturbative studies in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and                    QCD modelling.  The experimental work will probe issues in                      nuclear dynamics that have no clear separation between baryon-                  meson degrees of freedom and quark-gluon degrees of freedom.                    Important tools for addressing such issues are effective QCD                    models of hadron dynamics. The topics to be investigated include                the determination of the structure of the quark propagator                      through study of the QCD Schwinger-Dyson equations, the                         construction of covariant, confining models of QCD based on these               studies, the quark structure and interactions of baryons and                    mesons in such models and the electroweak couplings and form                    factors of these quark and quark-antiquark composites. The                      exchange visits by Drs. McKellar and Cahill are being supported                 through the Australian Department of Industry, Technology and                   Commerce (DITAC).",
