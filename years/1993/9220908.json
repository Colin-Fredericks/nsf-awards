 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. H. Strauss of the University of                       California will investigate the vibration-rotation spectra of                   small molecules in order to study the dynamical interactions in                 the condensed phase.  In this work the methods of infrared and                  Raman spectroscopy, neutron spectrscopy, time-dependent                         vibrational excitation, and theoretical analysis will be used                   to explore the dynamics of a number of liquid and solid                         systems.  The emphasis is on chemical systems that illustrate                   important general methods or elucidate important intermolecular                 interactions.  Infrared \"holeburning\" is used to study the                      ability of infrared radiation to cause changes in the molecular                 conformation and structure in solids at low temperature.  Raman                 spectral data of hydrogen gas dissolved in water or ice will be                 combined with theoretical calculations to determine the nature                  of the interactions in these systems.  The nearly free rotation                 of deuterated ammonium ions embedded in ammonium salts will be                  studied to ascertain the cause of observed different rate                       processes of reactions and to determine the effect of the                       inhomogeneous environment on them.  The iodine-benzene complex                  interaction will be investigated by Raman spectroscopy in order                 to understand the dynamics of the ground and excited states.                    %%%                                                                             These investigations serve to improve our understanding of                      molecular interactions in the condensed phase.  These                           interactions have a profound effect on the reaction dynamics                    and kinetics in liquid and solid systems.  The work on                          molecular hydrogen dissolved in ice will provide important data                 on the behavior of a quantum mechanical rotator embedded in a                   classical bath and will assist in the development of                            theoretical models for this process.  Such knowledge will be of                 use in understanding the properties of cold planets and moons                   which are believed to contain the hydrogen/ice system in their                  surface layers.",
