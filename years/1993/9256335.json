Proposals              were solicited from institutions whose existing facilities and                  staff could accommodate additional graduate students in Ph.D.                   programs of high quality.  The program is also intended to                      contribute to strengthening the Nation's human resource base across             all geographic sectors and among all under-represented groups.                  Graduate Research Traineeship awards are packages of student                    support.  The colleges and universities that receive the awards are             responsible for the selection of trainees, retention of trainees,               and administration of traineeships.                                                  The University of Colorado at Boulder will initiate a focused              traineeship program in the areas that couple applied, nonlinear,                and computational mathematics.  The initiative will integrate the               tools of high-performance computing into the educational program                with supercomputer facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratories               (LANL) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),                 provide for summer internships at national research laboratories                (LANL and NCAR), and fund an industrial laboratory seminar series.              The department will continue to make strong efforts to recruit and              retain students from under-represented groups.",
