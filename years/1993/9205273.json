 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project designs storage and retrieval methods for multimedia                databases, in collaboration with Dr. Christodoulakis, head of the               MUSIC-FORTH Center, Chanea, Greece. Specifically, it focuses on                 high-performance similarity retrieval of multimedia objects by                  content.  For text, it uses signature file methods, inversion and               combinations (hybrid methods). For images and other media (voice,               etc.), it examines indexing methods for high-dimensionality spaces,             treating objects as multi-dimensional points in feature space. Such             features could be, e.g., the Fourier-transform coefficients of an               image. Parallelism further improves the response time for large                 objects, using declustering methods, e.g., based on fractals or                 error correcting codes. The results of this work will be retrieval              and declustering methods for several types of media.  These methods             will serve as building blocks for the multimedia and object-                    oriented DBMSs of the near future.  This project, which is co-                  sponsored by the European Community Esprit program, will foster                 collaboration between researchers in the United States and Europe,              enhance exchange of research results, and speed up development of               a new generation of DBMSs.",
