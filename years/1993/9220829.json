 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an ongoing study of the function of                the large material donation or spermatophore transferred by male                monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) during mating.  Because                  there will often be a tradeoff between investment in present and                future matings, investment by males in more resources than are                  necessary to ensure fertilization in a single mating is of                      theoretical interest.  Two possible, but not mutually exclusive,                hypotheses are the focus of the project.  These are that the                    spermatophore provides nutrients to be used by the female in                    offspring production (paternal investment), or that it delays                   remating by the female, increasing the time during which the                    donating male's sperm are used to fertilize eggs (mating effort).               Studies of sperm competition and mating frequencies of wild                     butterflies will allow estimation of the portion of a male's                    investment that is available to his own offspring, and relative                 fitness gains from the nutrient and delayed remating effects of                 spermatophores.***//",
