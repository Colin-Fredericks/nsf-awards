 "awd_abstract_narration": "Melt condensation polymerization techniques are used in the                     polymer industry for the synthesis of thermoplastics and                        specialty polymers.  For example, saturated polyesters (such                    as poly(ethylene terephthalate) - PET and poly(butylene                         terephthalate) - PBT), polyamides, polyarylates, and                            polycarbonates are manufactured in either semi-batch or                         continuous polycondensation reactors.  Many of these processes                  are characterized by multiple reaction stages and complex                       reaction networks that give rise to various unwanted side                       products.  The pure molten monomers are polymerized in the                      absence of added solvents - a more environmentally friendly                     process than other industrial polymerization processes.  The                    process is also advantageous because the polymers can be                        directly pelletized or spun into fibers.                                                                                                                        A common feature of industrial melt polycondensation processes                  is that multiple reaction stages are employed using several                     reactors in series.  For PET production, the sequential                         reaction procedure includes: (a) monomers, low molecular                        weight oligomers, and low molecular weight prepolymers are                      synthesized in continuous stirred tank reactors, and (b) the                    prepolymers are then polymerized to higher molecular weight                     polymers in finishing polymerization reactors (often rotating                   disc reactors) where large vapor-liquid surface areas are                       provided.  The final polymer product properties are mostly                      regulated in this finishing polymerization stage, therefore                     the optimal design and operation of this reactor is important                   and is the objective this research.                                                                                                                             Specifically, the PI will address the following questions:                       (1) What are the major factors that affect the formation of                         polymer films on a rotating disc?  What are the                                 quantitative relations between the disc design/operating                        variables and film thickness?                                               (2) What is the role of gas bubbles of condensation                                 byproducts in the mass transfer process?  How can one                           quantify the effect of gas bubbles on the total vapor-                          liquid mass transfer rate?                                                  (3) What interactions occur between the neighboring discs and                       what will be the optimal layout of multiple discs on the                        agitator shaft?  What will be the optimal angle of disc                         immersion in the liquid pool?                                               (4) What is the overall liquid (polymer melt) flow pattern in                       the reactor?                                                                (5) How does the continuous finishing reactor behave under                          various reactor operating conditions and feed conditions                        at steady state and transient state?  What polymer                              properties are most strongly influenced by what reactor                         variables? How should one pair the polymer property                             parameters with reactor operating conditions for the                            design of product quality control systems?                                 Both experimental work and reactor modeling will be done.***//",
