 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to study the degradation and                   buckling of metal beams subjected to cyclic bending into the                    plastic range of the material.  The cross-sectional shapes which                will be considered are: tubular (square and circular), I, wide-                 flange and T. Previous work on cyclic bending of circular tubes                 has indicated that the interaction of material and geometric                    nonlinearities causes accumulation of deformation in the beam                   cross-section.  This leads to degradation of the structural                     response.  Persistent cycling results in buckling and                           catastrophic collapse of the structure.  Evidence exists that                   similar degradation and failure can occur in the other geometries               mentioned.                                                                                                                                                      The problems will be studied through a combination of experiment                and analysis.  The cyclic bending experiments will be conducted                 in a special purpose bending apparatus.  In these experiments the               curvature, bending moment and deformation of the cross-section                  will be monitored.  The analysis will be conducted using special                purpose numerical tools which include appropriate nonlinear                     kinematics and state-of-the-art cyclic plasticity models.  The                  models which yield good predictions in the cases studied will be                identified and used to help establish the cyclic degradation and                the onset of failure of the structures.",
