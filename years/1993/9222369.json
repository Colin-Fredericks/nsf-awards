 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222369  Rashotte    To survive in vastly different environmental conditions, such as  occur across the seasons of a year, animals and humans must have  good strategies for keeping their energy expenditure in balance  with energy intake.  Endothermic (warm-blooded) animals,  including humans, face the most serious problem because of the  need to maintain high body temperature and metabolic rate.  This  project will use advanced experimental methods to study in  greater detail than has previously been possible the ways a very  widely distributed and, in survival terms, highly successful  endothermic animal (the pigeon) manages to cope with the range of  environmental conditions in which it is found.  By using unique  computerized environments, this project will vary the ambient  temperature, the difficulty associated with finding food, and the  length of the daily light-dark cycle in ways that simulate some  natural conditions for these animals.  The experimental situation  in which they live is highly instrumented to record their use of  strategies for achieving energy balance through changing their  feeding behavior, body temperature, metabolic rate, and overall  daily activity level.  In some cases, the environmental  conditions are specifically designed to elucidate factors that  influence which of these strategies are brought into play when  the environment changes.  This project is unique in providing new  information about the changing interplay of these strategies  across the animal's normal daily cycle of activity and  inactivity, and in providing such data from animals which are  free to adopt varied combinations of these strategies over the  long term as they become acclimated to new environmental  conditions.    The outcome of this research is likely to deepen our knowledge of  the survival strategies used by endothermic animals to cope  successfully with varied environmental conditions.  With the new  and detailed information in hand which this project promises to  provided, it shoul d be possible to encourage new lines of future  research on specific brain and hormonal bases for these  strategies.  A thorough understanding of the relationship between  changes in environmental conditions and the appearance  of  certain survival-related strategies involving feeding,  metabolism, activity, and energy balance will contribute to basic  knowledge in the life sciences and may ultimately have relevance  for problems as diverse as the proper management of animal  habitats and seasonally related human disorders involving  metabolism and feeding.",
