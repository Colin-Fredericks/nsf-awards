 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be an exploratory study of the dissemination of               MathFINDER in two settings:  a university-based preservice teacher              education program and a field-based inservice teacher training                  program for mathematics teachers.  (MathFINDER is a CD-ROM disc                 which presents mathematics resources and teaching strategies based              on NCTM standards.)                                                                                                                                             Using qualitative evaluation methods--questionnaires, interviews                and observations--the researchers will provide data about the role              and use of curriculum materials, technological innovations, and                 curricular standards that have been acquired from the MathFINDER                disc.  The findings should inform and shape the design of a more                comprehensive evaluation and utilization study that (1)                         conceptually links curriculum materials to a set of reform                      standards, and (2) structures access to the materials that will                 support local reform initiatives.                                                                                                                               The findings of the exploratory study will be disseminated to                   several mathematics and science education reform networks,                      including the Statewide Systemic Initiative and Urban System                    Initiative projects.  The researchers expect to tentatively                     identify and describe the factors that facilitate or inhibit change             in reform settings in this study as a precursor for further study.",
