 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304998  Fischer    A unique aspect of the plant life cycle is the alternation of  generations between diploid sporophytes and haploid gametophytes.  In higher plants, the sporophyte is the dominant generation, and  the male and female gametophytes, greatly reduced in size and  complexity, are dependent upon the sporophyte. The female  gametophyte is formed in the ovule that is composed of specialized  tissues, integuments and nucellus. The nucellus gives rise to a  megasporocyte that undergoes meiosis to form four haploid  megaspores. Three megaspores degenerate, whereas the megaspore  adjacent to the nucellus grows and becomes the female gametophyte,  the embryo sac. Within the embryo sac, haploid nuclei generated by  mitotic divisions migrate to different cytoplasmic positions and  form structurally and functionally distinct cells, including the  egg cell. Ovule integuments surround the nucellus and embryo sac,  providing nutrients and form the opening for the pollen tube during  fertilization. Although a wealth of information about ovule and  female gametophyte morphology is available, the molecular  mechanisms that control their development are not known. The extent  to which their development is coordinated, how the striking  polarity of the ovule and gametophyte is generated, and the effect  of their cellular organization on subsequent development of the  embryo, is not understood. The strategy Dr. Fischer will use to  address these questions involves studying mutations in Arabidopsis  thaliana that reduce female fertility. He has isolated ovule  mutants among lines mutagenized by insertion of the T-DNA from  Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Mutant phenotypes include failure to  initiate integuments, abnormal integument development, aberrant  cell proliferation within the nucellus, degeneration of all spores,  repression of embryo sac formation, and embryo abortion. Molecular  genetic analysis of these mutants will provide information about  early events involving integument initiation and  megasporogenesis,  the role of integuments on embryo sac development, competition  between the nucellus and embryo sac for growth within the ovule,  and maternal effects on embryogenesis.  %%%  The significance of these experiments is that they will identify  genes and processes that regulate ovule and gametophyte development  and will provide insight into interactions between the haploid and  diploid generations. Moreover, they will advance our understanding  about how cells and tissues differentiate and communicate, and may  result in new conceptual information about processes leading to the  inception of the embryo in higher plants.  ***",
