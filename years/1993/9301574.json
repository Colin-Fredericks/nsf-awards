 "awd_abstract_narration": "9301574 Ramu The application of the variable structure and sliding mode control techniques to reduce the vibratory effects in civil structures due to wind and earthquake forces, will be investigated.  Algorithms for synthesizing the control forces for both linear and nonlinear models of the structures will be developed.  For physical application of control forces, an electric actuator with regenerative capability is proposed.  Energy regeneration concept  utilized for braking trains and other moving systems will be used both for controlling the vibratory effects and for recovering the energy from the structures for subsequent cycles in the active control of structures.  The proposed regeneration capability is expected to reduce the energy storage requirement and will lead to an efficient utilization of the power for the application of control forces.  The time delays inherent in the control system and the issues concerning real time implementation of the controller using single chip micro controller will be analyzed.  This is a collaborative research effort involving an electrical engineering team and a structural engineering team.  The outcome is expected to be an integration of research ideas in the field of control and structural engineering to develop a practical approach to mitigate the hazardous vibratory effects in civil structures.",
