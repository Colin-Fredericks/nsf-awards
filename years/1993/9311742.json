Recent research  suggests that a constriction in the domains of ethnic language  use must be considered in addition to external factors such as  age, sex, social class, etc.    This research will explore the idea that change is also due to  the restriction in domains (socially defined settings) in which  bilingual speakers use the ethnic language in the community.  The  Spanish spoken by Mexican-Americans in the United States,  Southwest Spanish, is characterized by phenomena typical to  language situations, for example, phonological transfer, loan  translations, and lexical borrowings.  This study will be  conducted in a Spanish-English community (San Antonio) and in a  home/family domain rather than a school domain, as in previous  research.  Sociolinguistic sampling and data collection will be  conducted with young adults and adults.  Data will be deposited  in the University of Texas-San Antonio, Hispanic Research Center.    Results of this research will add to our knowledge of Spanish  sociolinguistics and will have potential application in bilingual  education, language acquisition, and language policy and  planning.  ***",
