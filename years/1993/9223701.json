 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues research begun under an earlier NSF grant                on the dynamics and learning in multistage games.  Since                        experiments, oligopoly experiments, bargaining experiments,                     committee experiments, and experiments in many other settings                   studied by social scientists are conducted by multi-stage games,                a better understanding of these dynamics is critical to the kinds               of inferences that can be made from the data.  This project                     develops a unified theoretical and econometric approach with a                  structure that permits the rigorous analysis of diverse                         experimental data from multi-stage games.                                                                                                                       The theoretical development involves modification of standard                   game theoretic analysis by introducing random errors in actions                 (trembles) and beliefs (home-made priors and non-Bayesian                       updating).  Different specifications of these random components,                including assumptions about the degree to which subjects take                   errors into account in their own decision making, lead to several               classes of models which can be rigorously evaluated and compared                using data from simple experimental games.  These alternative                   models can also be used to rigorously analyze - for the first                   time - data from earlier experiments that offer descriptive                     evidence about what appear to be systematic departures from fully               rational behavior.",
