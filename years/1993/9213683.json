 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heterogeneous catalysis is used in the chemical and petroleum                   industries for the manufacture of a variety of valuable                         products.  Inorganic membrane reactors combine the catalytic                    reaction and separation functions into one unit.  The                           attractiveness of these reactors arises from their                              substantially improved performance for reversible reaction                      systems; as the products are continuously removed the                           reactions can shift to higher conversions, not limited by                       equilibrium considerations.  For a fixed total amount of                        catalyst, the question arises as to how it should be                            distributed within the membrane so that the membrane reactor                    performance (for example reaction rate, product purity, etc.)                   is optimized.  This is the motivation for this research                         project.                                                                                                                                                        The PI plans to conduct a combined theoretical-experimental                     study, to investigate the performance of catalytic membrane                     reactors with controlled catalyst distribution.  Theoretical                    work will identify the optimal catalyst distribution required                   to maximize specific performance indices (for example,                          reactant conversion, product purity, etc.).  This will include                  analysis of membrane reactors where the catalyst is                             distributed in a controlled manner along the membrane                           thickness as well as along the reactor length.  Experimental                    work will be directed towards preparing and testing such                        membranes, and will permit a quantitative comparison with                       theoretical predictions.***//",
