 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support and in close collaboration             with Ukrainian colleagues, Dr. Anthony Marks will conduct                       archaeological work in Crimea. Previous excavations have                        demonstrated the presence of rich Middle Paleolithic industries                 which contain human remains in addition to faunal materials.                    However these sites were excavated many years ago and employed                  techniques which are inadequate by present day standards. Dr. Marks             and his collaborators will re-excavate and study seven of these. In             particular they will attempt to obtain absolute dates for                       individual stratigraphic levels and will employ a range of                      techniques. These include thermolumenescent dating of both burned               flint and sediment, uranium series dating and finally radiocarbon               dating for younger deposits. In addition to obtaining samples for               age determination, excavation will serve to clarify stratigraphic               problems and to obtain large samples of faunal and lithic remains               which will be analyzed to reconstruct Middle Paleolithic lifeways.                                                                                              Both archaeological and fossil data indicate that anatomically                  modern humans first appeared in Africa over 90,000 years ago. They              later occur in the Near East but it is not until 40,000 or so years             ago that they are found in the rest of the Old World.                           Archaeologists wish to trace this spread because until dates are                available for different parts of the world and patterns of movement             known, it is extremely difficult to understand the processes which              lead to the origins and spread of modern humans. The Crimea is                  known to contain important fossil bearing sites from the relevant               period but the data are scanty and poorly collected. Since Crimea               lies near one of the major routes out of the Near East it is an                 area worthy of investigation.                                                                                                                                   This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                the archaeological data base for an important and little known                  region of the world. It will add to our understanding of the origin             and spread of modern humans and assist in the training of Ukrainian             archaeologists.",
