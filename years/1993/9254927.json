The                                    booklets include a rationale for choosing a science-                            based career and encouragement to seek out                                      postsecondary institutions that offer science and                               engineering curricula.  The booklets include much                               practical advice on admissions, orientation,                                    establishing support services, interaction with                                 faculty, asssistive technology, and pre-career science                          work experiences.                                                                                                                                               The booklets were developed in 1987-89 as part of                               an NSF-funded research project conducted by                                     American Institutes of Research (AIR) and AAAS                                  on critical factors contributing to entry and                                   advancement by persons with disabilities in science,                            mathematics, and engineering fields.  In the course                             of the study, 280 working scientists and engineers                              and students with disabilities were interviewed.  The                           content of the booklets was developed from these                                interviews.                                                                                                                                                     AAAS will design and publish the booklets in an                                 attractive format and will do some editing so that                              the legislative information and language meet 1992                              standards.  Announcements about the availability of                             the booklets will be placed in both the science                                 education and disability press and announced in                                 electronic networks.  Single copies will be                                     distributed with a cover letter/return sheet to obtain                          feedback.  Multiple copies will be distributed at                               appropriate meetings.",
