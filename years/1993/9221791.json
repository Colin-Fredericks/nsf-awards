 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oceans play an important role in regulating the Earth's                     climate, not only through their well recognized role as a                       reservoir and transport medium for moisture and heat, but also as               a major dynamic reservoir for climatically sensitive gases such                 as carbon dioxide. Interactions between physical, biological and                chemical processes are important to understand in order to                      examine the exchange of physical and chemical quantities between                the atmosphere and the deep oceans.  The goal of this project is                to develop, test and modify an integrated physical-biological-                  carbon dioxide ocean model in an effort to simulate and evaluate                interactions controlling the exchange of carbon dioxide between                 the atmosphere and ocean in the Southern Ocean.  The Southern                   Ocean is of particular importance because it represents one of                  two regions in the world where significant deep water comes in                  contact with the atmosphere, allowing direct exchange of gases                  where substantial quantities of surface water downwell to aphotic               depths while still containing high concentrations of unutilized                 nutrients at the Antarctic Polar Front.  The potential                          utilization of excess nutrients by phytoplankton may have a                     substantial impact on carbon dioxide flux.  The large seasonal                  variability within the physical, biological, and chemical system                leads to an extreme range in the rate and direction of exchange                 with atmosphere and consequently, it is not clear whether this                  region is one of net uptake or release of carbon dioxide to the                 atmosphere.  Results from this modelling effort will prove                      important to advancing oceanographic research in the Southern                   Ocean.",
