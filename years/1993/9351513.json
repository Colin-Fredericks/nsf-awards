 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to create a Laboratory for Undergraduates in                         Computer Science where students will be exposed to programming                  issues in a variety of real world problems. The Laboratory will                 give students a basic understanding of real time programming,                   distributed systems, communication, simulation, and graphics by                 exposing the students to applications in robotics, computer                     vision, and 3D modeling. Students will gain leadership skills                   and experience with project teams by going beyond textbook                      exercises in areas such as computer hardware, interfaces,                       distributed systems, communication, and real-time control. The                  Laboratory will be used both for independent projects for                       undergraduates and for assignments in specific courses, from                    the sophomore year through the senior year, including senior                    and honors projects. The Laboratory will have a major impact on                 the quality of Computer Science education by giving students                    access to state of the art equipment they would not otherwise                   see until they find employment. As has happened with recent                     improvements in our curriculum, this Lab will have a major                      impact in higher education throughout the State of Minnesota.                   We envision this Laboratory as a collection of reconfigurable                   workcells, each equipped with cameras, manipulators, and other                  specialized devices, where students can conduct a large variety                 of experiments. Equipment will be standardized to simplify the                  reconfiguration of the workcells and for ease of maintenance.                   We will acquire off-the-shelf equipment that can be used in                     different combinations for a large collection of projects. This                 will increase the flexibility in the use of the Lab and will                    easily accommodate student initiated projects.",
