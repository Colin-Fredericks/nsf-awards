 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305399  Stolz  The strictly anaerobic microbe, Geobacter metallireducens (GS-15)  is a dissimilatory iron reducing bacterium which couples the  oxidation of short chain fatty acids and aromatic compounds to the  reduction of Fe(III), nitrate, Mn(IV), or U(VI).  This type of  organism is extremely important in the oxidation of organics and  the reduction of inorganics and metals in anaerobic soil, aquifers,  and estuarine sediments.  Nitrate induces both nitrate reductase  (NR) and the overexpression of five c-type cytochromes.  This NR is  stable under oxic conditions and its inhibition by oxygen is  reversible.  It appears to contain three polypeptides of Mr 18, 36,  and 43 kDa and three c-type cytochromes (Mr 28, 46, and 68 kDa),  and is not related to the NRs from other nitrate-respiring or  denitrifying bacteria.  The objective of this proposal is to fully  characterize this novel NR and determine which cytochromes are  involved in nitrate reduction.  The NR and cytochromes will be  purified, native structure, midpoint potentials, substrate  specificity, and kinetics will be determined, and antibodies will  be raised against each purified macromolecule.  The pathway of  nitrate reduction and electron transport will be deduced from the  data.  Future studies will use the antibodies as a taxonomic tool  in comparative studies and as environmental probes.  %%%  Geobacter metallireducens is a bacterium which grows by coupling  the oxidation of organic carbon to the reduction of iron in the  total absence of oxygen.  The type of organism is extremely  important in anoxic soils, aquifers, and estuarine sediments, since  it also metabolizes organic pollutants like benzene and toluene,  and inorganic contaminants, such as nitrate, manganese, and  uranium.  Preliminary work has shown that the enzyme that converts  nitrate to nitrite in this cell is novel and its function involves  c-type cytochromes.  The purpose of this work is then to  characterize the novel nitrate reductase and then determine th e  cytochrome(s) involved in nitrate reduction.  The results from this  study will help elucidate this unusual process of nitrate  reduction, and provide the background for future studies on other  unique biochemical pathways in this remarkable organism.  ***",
