 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a renewal of research to establish a climatic reference                 section for examining the synchroneity of the exceptionally large               and rapid changes in climate that occurred before, during, and                  after the last glacial maximum (~35Ka to 12.5ka).  The                          hydrologically closed Estancia basin in central New Mexico is                   especially well suited as a reference section because of its                    previous location under the Polar Front Jet Stream, because of its              uninterrupted high-resolution stratigraphic and paleontologic                   record, and because it recorded a strong, clear, and measurable                 response to climate forcing.  Abundant ostracodes and pollen are                available for AMS dating.  The sampling interval, owing to a high               accumulation rate and weak bioturbation, has a practical resolution             for changes in climate of less than a decade.  Closely spaced (~50-             yr) analyses of sediment composition, oxygen 18 and carbon 13, and              hydrochemistry (ostracode species abundance), along with mass-                  balance calculations and a hydrologic model will be used to                     quantify P-E on the time scale of centuries to millennia.  Gray-                scale images linked to compositional and other changes analyzed at              more closely spaced intervals will characterize interannual to                  century-scale climatic variability.  Patterns of recorded climatic              variability include ~2000-yr highstand and lowstands, very strong               ~200-to 250-yr, Maunder-scale oscillations, and ~20-years cycles.               A more accurate age model and chronostratigraphy based on AMS                   dating of abundant ostracodes will determine the timing of the                  unusually large and rapid climatic fluctuations recorded at the                 Estancia site during the glacial maximum and during the later part              of isotope stage 3.  The Estancia reference section will be the                 first complete, land-based high-resolution chronology for changes               in climate during this important time interval.  It will serve as               the basis for correlating and interpreting regional shifts in                   climate as well as hemispheric and global climatic events.",
