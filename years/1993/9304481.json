 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304481  Rubin    Predictions of contaminant transport by groundwater, as well as  monitoring and management, are based on quantitative models of  solute motion.  Present methods for prediction of contaminant  transport are inadequate because they fail to account explicitly  for measured data at its locations.  They also do not account  realistically for the effects of heterogeneity in the conductivity  and temporal variability in pressure (or only under some  simplifying assumptions), and they do not offer an economic means  of designing a monitoring scheme where the observed data are used  to update the predictive models.  Furthermore, little attempt has  been directed so far to obtain a better understanding of transport  in highly heterogeneous geologic formations and the effects of  chemical reactions on transport at the field scale.  Lastly,  current predictive methods fail to link the predictions with any  criterion of goodness of fit.  In this study, we propose to develop  a modeling strategy which considers the aquifer hydraulic  properties, the velocity field, and the solute concentration as  random space functions, expressed in terms of initial/boundary  conditions and various physical parameters, and which allow, both  spatial variability and prediction uncertainty to be analyzed with   probabilistic, quantitative tools.  Three-dimensional random  function models will be obtained for steady and unsteady nonuniform  velocity fields and will be used for predicting the various moments  of the concentration of reactive and non-reactive contaminants for  anisotropic conductivity fields.  Bayesian analysis will make the  predictions locally conditioned.  The model will be applied to two  field studies.  We plan to achieve a better understanding of  transport phenomena at the fundamental level and obtain risk-  qualified, locally-conditioned estimates of solute spreading in  applications.  We plan to generalize existing stochastic transport  theories to account for higher-order variability i n the flow field,  to investigate the influence of flow unsteadiness and  nonuniformity, to evaluate the relevance of unsteadiness to the  prediction of solute transport under typical conditions, and  finally to suggest simplified methods to incorporate flow  unsteadiness, flow nonuniformity and chemical reactions into  predictions.  ***",
