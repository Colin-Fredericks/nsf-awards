 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is better to understand smooth                 and symplectic 4-manifolds.  Smooth 4-manifolds are spaces which                are locally diffeomorphic to Euclidean 4-space.  Symplectic                     manifolds are endowed with additional structure which keeps track               of areas and volumes.  For both types of 4-manifolds, the most                  basic questions of existence and uniqueness are still poorly                    understood; it is these questions which the project addresses.                  Traditionally, these two types of objects have been studied by                  rather different methods, but the principal investigator's                      research to date shows that much can be gained from a unified                   approach.  In fact, he has solved major problems in both fields                 by simple \"cut-and-paste\" constructions (log transforms and                     connected sums along surfaces). He intends to apply these and                   related techniques to produce even better examples (for example,                simply connected, irreducible symplectic 4-manifolds with small                 second betti numbers).  These, and other examples which the                     principal investigator has already produced, should be detectable               by means of gauge theory.  Other examples which might be produced               (such as a simply connected, symplectic, non-Kaehler 6-manifold,                or a symplectic 4-manifold which splits as a connected sum of                   indefinite pieces) could be detected by elementary means.                            Smooth manifolds of dimension 4 are presently the least                    understood manifolds of any dimension.  Only in the last decade                 has substantial progress been made in understanding the possible                shapes of these objects.  This is particularly ironic in that our               own universe is an example of a 4-dimensional manifold.                         Symplectic manifolds have also come under intense study recently.               These objects first appeared in connection with classical                       mechanics, the physics of macroscopic objects such as mechanical                systems and orbiting satellites.  Subsequently, they have turned                out to play a deep role in quantum physics, so they are of great                interest to physicists who are attempting to understand the                     fundamental forces of nature.  Symplectic manifolds are also of                 interest to pure mathematicians because of their appearance in                  such diverse fields as algebraic geometry, gauge theory and Lie                 group theory.  It is the principal investigator's belief that                   there are deep and largely unexplored connections between the                   theories of symplectic manifolds and smooth 4-manifolds.  The                   instant research project is to exploit these connections to                     illuminate both theories.",
