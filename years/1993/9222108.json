 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222108  Jeanne    The most remarkable of the social wasps are the tropical species in which new  colonies are established by large groups called swarms.  The 24 \"swarm-founding\"  genera evolved from a more primitive type, still represented in the tropical fauna,  in which colonies are founded by one or a few inseminated queens acting  independently, without the help of workers.  Not only do the swarm-founding  species form the largest, most conspicuous, and most pugnacious colonies, but they  dominate the \"independent-founders\" ecologically, exceeding them in sheer  numbers in some localities by several thousand to one.  An important reason for  the striking success of the swarm-founders is that their entire life cycle is spent  as a group.  This gives them an advantage in countering the high risk of predation  that faces life in the tropics.      Swarming cannot work unless the scout wasps, who choose a site suitable for a  new nest, can communicate its location to the rest of the swarm.  How this is done  is known for one species only:  the scouts lay a trail of chemical scent-marks,  which their swarm-mates follow to the new site.  The scent is produced by a  particular gland on the abdomen in this species.  A number of other swarm-  founding genera have the same gland, but in some of these the form of the gland  is different, suggesting other functions.  In still other species the gland is entirely  lacking, suggesting other means of recruiting swarm members.  These facts  suggest (1) that chemical trails are not universal among swarm-founders and (2)  that swarm-founding itself may have had two or more independent origins.     The ultimate objective of Dr. Jeanne's research is to determine the specific  swarm-recruitment mechanisms utilized by seven key swarm-founding genera  and to use the results to test among several hypotheses on the evolution of these  mechanisms.  The results will yield a much-improved picture of the varieties of  communication evolved among the swarm-founding genera  and provide an explicit  phylogenetic model for the evolution of swarm-recruitment mechanisms.  This will  make it possible to conduct rigorous comparative studies on the adaptive  significance of these mechanisms.  Finally, the research will contribute  significantly to understanding the evolution of an extraordinarily successful form  of social behavior in insects.",
