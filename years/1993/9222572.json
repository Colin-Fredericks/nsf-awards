 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222572  Terry Baker      This is an exploitation of carbon filaments as a catalyst support medium.  Catalytically grown carbon filaments have attributes both of active carbon and of graphite; they have high surface area but are an ordered array of graphitic microcrystals with a high density of active edge sites.  In this effort, attention is focussed on the catalytic behavior of platinum or iron particles supported on carbon filaments and on the catalytic properties of the carbon filaments themselves.  Specific issues under investigation include the use of oxidation treatments to increase the surface areas of the filaments; methods of introducing platinum or iron particles onto the surface; structural and chemical changes of supported particles under various reaction conditions; and comparisons of the catalytic activities of carbon-filament-supported metal particles with those of particles on conventional support media.  A combination of techniques is employed including controlled-atmosphere electron microscopy, in-situ electron diffraction, thermogravimetry, chemisorption, temperature-programmed desorption, and flow-reactor studies.    The high-surface-area carbon filaments may have applications and advantages in a number of industrial and pollution control situations as catalysts, catalyst supports, or separations (adsorption) agents.  This is a high-risk investigation.",
