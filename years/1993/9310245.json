 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop empirically based,                    general equilibrium models of the monetary transmission                         mechanism, and use them to evaluate the desirability of                         alternative monetary policies.  The research consists of five                   parts.  The first develops a monetary model of the aggregate                    economy and proposes to investigate its implications for the                    proper conduct of monetary policy.  In the second part, the model               will be estimated with a broad set of financial data.  The third                part involves building a richer intermediate financial sector                   based on findings from parts one and two.  The fourth part of the               research well entail the investigation of the small sample                      properties of the statistical tools that will be used for model                 evaluation.  The final part of the study will investigate the                   potential for seasonal demand shocks to the economy to help                     account for features of the business cycle.  The conventional                   view is that seasonal shocks are irrelevant, and thus it is                     appropriate to use seasonally adjusted data for model estimation.               This project is important because it will provide a better                      understanding of the interrelationships between monetary policy                 and the business cycle.",
