 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modulating the level of protein biosynthetic machinery in response              to growth conditions is of utmost importance to every living cell.              In E. coli, two different regulatory systems couple the rate of                 ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis to growth rate.  However, the actual             mechanism(s) linking the central metabolism of the cell to the rate             of rRNA synthesis remain completely unknown.  The observation that              increased amounts of fructose 1,6 biphosphate (FbP) preferentially              inhibits in connecting central metabolism regulation of rRNA                    synthesis.  The development of a crude transcription-translation                system in which FbP specially inhibits rRNA synthesis provides an               experimental system for dissecting this effect.  Experiments to                 determine whether RNA polymerase alone or additional factors in the             crude extract are needed for inhibition will determine the target               of FbP action.  Genetic analysis of this interaction will establish             the growth conditions under which the regulatory circuit involving              FbP is operative.                                                               %%%                                                                             This project offers a chance to understand a molecular circuit that             couples rRNA synthesis to carbon metabolism, a problem of central               importance to every living organism that has not been elucidated in             any experimental system.",
