 "awd_abstract_narration": "New methodologies have opened up the possibility of discovering how             young infants perceive the world around them, and even how they                 think about it.  This research will examine the relations between               infants' representations of objects and substances and early                    language learning.  The studies will establish the ways in which                language learning requires children to conceputalize the world in               new terms and the ways in which language learning simply requires               children to learn how their language expresses the concepts they                already possess.                                                                                                                                                One series of studies will explore how babies establish                         representations of distinct objects in their environment, and how               they track identity of these objects over time.  Previous research              has discovered a change in the criteria for object individuation                and object identity beginning around eleven months of age that is               related to learning to comprehend object labels.                                                                                                                Other series of studies will explore the processes underlying word              learning by 2- to 4-year-old children, documenting continuing                   changes in lexical representations throughout the preschool years.                                                                                              These studies will shed light on fundamental questions concerning               the relations between language and thought.  Furthermore, they will             contribute to a deeper understanding of normal language and                     cognitive development, in terms of which abnormal development can               be better understood.",
