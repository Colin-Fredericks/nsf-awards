 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed work is to develop a freshman                     level course, Foundations of Computer Science,in the interface                  of computer science and mathematics that integrates critical                    reasoning, provlem-solving strategies and discrete mathematics                  topics with fundamental computer science concepts.  Mathematics                 and computer science educators have observed and commented on                   the weaknesses of entering college students in the areas of                     problem solving and mathematical reasoning, skills which are                    fundamental to computer science and should be a primary focus                   of the first college level course for computer science majors.                  The course to be developed emphasizes the importance of                         mathematics and provlem-solving concepts within the context of                  computer science and its applications. Computer laboratories                    are an integral component of this philosophy.  Hands-on                         experience acts as a catalyst to reinforce course material,                     provides motivation for learning and encourages students to be                  creative, independent thinkers.  An added bonus is the wide                     applicability of such an approach to other mathematically based                 disciplines.                                                                    The primary objective is to develop and evaluate material which                 makes it easier for educators to teach mathematically based                     introductory computer science courses and to integrate these                    concepts into existing courses. The material to be developed                    includes guidelines, available resources, annotated notes,                      problem sets, exam questions and laboratory software and                        manuals.  The material will be disseminated through                             announcements in mathematics/computer science education                         journals, meetings, newsletters, electronic bulletin boards and                 direct nailings.  Evaluation of course material using both                      problem-solving and mathematics pre- and post- tests and survey                 questionnaires can assess the suitability of this approach for                  introductory computer science and can improve the quality of                    the material.  Evaluation of laboratory material canalso                        significantly improve the quality of supporting courseware and                  manuals.",
