 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310267  King         Unlocking the mysteries of infertility will require a better  understanding of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), a  decapeptide responsible for the activation of the pituitary-gonadal  function.  Neurons in the brain that synthesize and release LHRH  are dispersed as individual cells or small clusters of cells across  broad region of the base of the brain which includes the preoptic  area and hypothalamus.  Dr. King believes that the positioning of  LHRH neurons, although diffuse, are exquisitely regulated to  facilitate integration of multiple internal and external factors to  synchronize secretion and optimize reproductive success.  Using a  combination of anatomical, histochemical and molecular tools, she  will continue to examine the heterogeneity of LHRH neuronal  subpopulations.  She will identify the specific groups of neurons  that are synthesizing LHRH at time when it is important for the  induction of ovulation.  These neurons will then be reconstructed  and studied in three dimensions using computer assisted analyses.   The results from these studies will determine if a certain group of  brain cells are critical to ovulation and reproduction.  Dr. King  will also examine a dynamic model whereby non-neural or glial  elements influence the secretion of LHRH from ends of the nerve  cells into the blood capillaries to enhances its transport to the  pituitary gland.  She will evaluate LHRH neurons/glial interactions  in response to various hormone treatments that are known to  influence ovulation.  This work will significantly expand our  understanding of the fine-tuning mechanism involved in LHRH release  occurring under physiological conditions.  The outcome of these  studies should have critical impact on the understanding of  infertility and will serve as an impetus for its treatment.    ***",
