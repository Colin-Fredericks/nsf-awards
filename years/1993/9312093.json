 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312093  Mayr  This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic  Chemistry Program supports research on metal-carbon triple  bonds by Dr. Andreas Mayr of the Chemistry Department, State  University of New York at Stonybrook.  Emphasis will be placed  on two projects: 1) coupling reactions of alkylidyne ligands  with other terminal ligands, and 2) reactions of metal  alkylidyne complexes with unsaturated organic substrates.  The  carbon-carbon bond-forming steps of alkylidyne-carbonyl and  alkylidyne-alkylidyne coupling reactions will be studied in  detail.  The feasibility of coupling alkylidynes with  thiocarbonyl, nitrosyl, and imido ligands will be explored.  Alkylidyne complexes containing sigma-bonded eta-1-hydrocarbon  ligands, such as alkyl, aryl, and vinyl, will be synthesized  and methods to induce the migration of the hydrocarbon ligand  to the alkylidyne will be tested.  In the second project, the  basic conditions for carbon-carbon bond formation during  reactions of alkylidyne metal complexes with alkenes and  alkynes will be studied.  %%%  The general goal of this research is to develop new ways to  form carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom chemical bonds, and to  understand the role transition metals play in mediating their  formation.  The results will provide a basis for developing new  organometallic reagents for organic synthesis and provide  models for proposed mechanistic steps of catalytic processes,  such as reductive polymerization of carbon monoxide,  hydrocarbon skeletal rearrangement, and hydrocarbon  hydrogenolysis.  Novel organometallic compounds will be  synthesized in the course of the research.  ***",
