 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311922  HOROWITZ  Juries have the implicit power to acquit defendants despite evidnce  and judicial instructions to the contrary.  This power, embedded in  the phenomenon called jury nullification, has historically  permitted sympathetic juries to acquit those who are legally guilty  but morally upright.  This research proposal presents a theory that  predicts when juries obey the law (that is, follow their prescribed  role as finders of the facts) and when they sometimes disobey the  law (i.e., do not apply the law as instructed).  The research also  examines the concepts of nullification in civil trials, a neglected  area of concern.  The theory distinguishes between nullification,  which we define as a principled decision to disobey the law, and  other forms of jury noncompliance with the judge's instructions.   This research will allow for a clearer understanding of when and  why juries disobey the law.  Jury nullification is an increasingly  important topic but it has been enmeshed in speculation and  unsubstantiated assumptions about how juries operate.  The  nullification controversy, and the place of the jury in the legal  system, will be well served by a serious empirical investigation of  the jury's nullification tendencies.    To test the predictions made by our theory of jury nullification,  we have designed three experiments using individuals drawn from  juror rolls who will view various videotaped trials in a realistic  setting (the moot courtroom of a law school).  These jurors will  deliberate to a verdict.  The deliberations will be taped and both  outcomes and group decision processes analyzed.  The experiments  examine the nullification process in both criminal and civil  trials.  The results of these experiments will provide empirical  information about why and how juries decide to obey or disobey the  dictates of the court.  ***",
