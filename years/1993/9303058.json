 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303058  Ewing       Aerosols in a variety of sizes, shapes and compositions are  found throughout the earth's atmosphere.  Some are easily observed  as clouds, haze, smog or smoke and they affect weather, climatology  and the radiation energy balance.  Some are nucleation sites or  cloud formation.  Others are sources of rich chemistry and  photochemistry.  With the obvious importance of aerosols, many  techniques have been directed toward their study.       This research advances the view that an understanding of  important atmospheric aerosols will be enhanced by exploring the  physical and chemical properties of their surfaces.  A versatile  analytical technique for this exploration is infrared spectroscopy.       While many types of aerosols are amenable to infrared  spectroscopic interrogation, salt particles are chosen as examples  of the analytical techniques.  These particles are of particular  relevance.  Sea salt aerosols generated over the oceans contribute  one of the, if not the, most abundant particulate loads on the  global atmosphere.  Their composition is transformed by an  intricate chemistry.  Two methods for producing suspended salt  particles in a temperature controlled chamber will be investigated.  Since the optical path will be in excess of 100 m, infrared  sensitivity allows interrogation of the size, shape and composition  of the aerosols as well as molecules stuck to their surfaces.  For  solid salt aerosols the incorporation of OH- and other ions at the  surface as well as water overlayers will be explored. Reactions of  NO2 at the surface will also be monitored.  Water, OH-, NO2 and  other oxides have been targeted for laboratory studies of salt  because similar surface chemistry is likely to occur in the  atmosphere.  Experiments to explore the properties of supported  salt particles will also be performed and methods for interrogating  surface defect concentrations will be explored.  It is suggested  that atmospheric chemistry is initiated at these surface defects .   For ice particles spectroscopic interrogation will likely be able  to characterize their interior structure (e.g. amorphous, ice I, or  microporous) as well as their surface properties.  It is the  surface properties that dictate the type of heterogeneous chemistry  that occurs in aerosols, whether in the laboratory or in the  atmosphere.       Preliminary experiments with both suspended and supported  aerosols have already been successful in the laboratory of the  Principal Investigator.  These successes suggest the practically of  the experiments.  The infrared spectroscopic interrogation  of these laboratory produced aerosols will reveal the feasibility  for future experiments on aerosols in the atmosphere.",
