 "awd_abstract_narration": "An  inverse relation between the capacity for growth  (i.e.               maximum growth potential) and length of the growing season over a               latitudinal  gradient  has recently been  discovered  in  fishes.               This intriguing form of intraspecific \"countergradient variation\"               may  represent  a  widespread adaptive strategy for  coping  with               seasonal  environments.  Using primarily the Atlantic silverside,               Menidia  menidia, as a model organism, this project will evaluate               the  selective  forces, evolutionary responses, and physiological               mechanisms underlying latitudinal adaptation. The premise is that               rapid  growth  in  the north is an evolutionary  response  to  an               intensely  seasonal environment:  i.e., one where large  size  is               necessary to survive long winters, but where only a brief growing               season  is  available  in  which  to  attain  large  size.    The               theoretical prediction that faster growth can occur only  at  the               expense  of some other life history function will also be tested.               Experiments  on  laboratory stocks of silversides from  different               latitudes  are designed to:  1) determine the influence  of  body               size,  lipid storage and genotype on overwinter survival; and  2)               test  for  genetic variation in energy acquisition and allocation               to  various metabolic functions such as food processing,  growth,               swimming   and  reproductive  performance.   Results  will   have               implications  for our knowledge of life history theory,  resource               management,  and  the  response of marine  organisms  to  climate               change.",
