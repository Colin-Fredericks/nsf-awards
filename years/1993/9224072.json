 "awd_abstract_narration": "The taxonomic circumscription and relationships among                           members of Cornaceae dogwoods have long been                                    controversial.  From one to 15 genera have been                                 ascribed to this family by various authors.                                     Furthermore, little agreement exists regarding the                              composition, taxonomic rank, and relationships of                               subgroups within Cornus.  To resolve relationships at                           several taxonomic levels in this enigmatic group,                               nucleotide sequences of both chloroplast and nuclear                            genes will be obtained.  Comparative sequencing of the                          chloroplast gene rbcL, which evolves slowly, will be                            used to test traditional concepts of circumscription of                         Cornaceae and to identify close relatives of Cornus.                            The rbcL sequence data obtained to date reveal that                             Cornus and 11 other genera form a cornaceous clade that                         differs from all previously proposed cornaceous groups                          and also indicate that some genera traditionally placed                         in Cornaceae are only distantly related to Cornus.  To                          understand better the closest relatives of Cornus, rbcL                         sequence data are needed for additional key genera.                             Within the cornaceous clade, comparative sequencing of                          the chloroplast gene ORFK, which evolves three times                            faster that rbcL, will be used to elucidate                                     relationships among Cornus and its close allies.                                Within Cornus, our analysis of chloroplast DNA                                  restriction site data has already yielded a                                     phylogenetic hypothesis based on 24 species.                                    Comparative sequencing of the internal transcribed                              spacer regions (ITS-1 and ITS-2) of the nuclear                                 ribosomal RNA genes (rnDNA) will facilitate a direct                            comparison of the concordance of nuclear and                                    chloroplast DNA phylogenies with Cornus.  In addition                           to elucidating relationships within a notoriously                               problematic group, this study will be of broad                                  systematic importance because it represents one of the                          first attempts to employ chloroplast genes other that                           rbcL in phylogenetic reconstruction and compare nuclear                         and cytoplasmically based phylogenies.  Lastly, the                             evolution of certain morphological, cytological,                                phytochemical, phytochemical, and embryological                                 characters will also be examined in light of the                                molecular phylogenies obtained.",
