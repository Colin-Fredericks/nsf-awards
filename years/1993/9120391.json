Biobased                                               industrial products are chemicals                                               and materials derived from renewable                                            resources and include such items as                                             biodegradable plastics, chemical                                                feedstocks, adsorbent polymers,                                                 cosmetic ingredients, waxes,                                                    lubicants, resins, gums, and                                                    pharmaceuticals.  A committee of                                                about 12 experts will examine key                                               issues dealing with research and                                                commercialization, and address                                                  future biobased product                                                         opportunities offered by advances in                                            biotechnology and the chemical and                                              material sciences.  Workshops                                                   dealing with key research and                                                   commercialization aspects will be                                               held to augment the information base                                            of the committee.  A final report                                               will provide an authoritative                                                   perspective on biobased products and                                            guidance for future actions by                                                  government, industry and academia                                               during the next decade.",
