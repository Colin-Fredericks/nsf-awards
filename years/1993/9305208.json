 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proper form of a multicellular organism requires precise                    control of terminal differentiation events.  This research will                 address how a single terminal differentiation event is executed                 during the development of a simple model organism, the nematode C.              elegans.  The analysis will focus on the terminal differentiation               of lateral hypodermal \"seam\" cells, which terminally differentiate              during the final (4th) molt.  Several distinct cellular processes               are coordinately controlled during this terminal differentiation                event, including cell cycle, cell fusion, and the stage-specific                regulation of cuticle gene expression.  A gene called lin-29 has                been identified as a pivotal component in programming the execution             of seam cell terminal differentiation.  Loss of lin-29 function                 causes hypodermal cells of the adult stage to reiterate                         indefinitely the larval program of cell divisions instead of                    exiting the cell cycle and differentiating.  lin-29 encodes a                   putative transcription factor of the (Cys)2-(His)2 class, and, thus             likely programs these events by regulating the transcription of                 other genes.  The major objective of this work is to identify genes             controlled by the lin-29 protein.  Three approaches will be                     employed to identify lin-29-regulated genes.  \u01311! Interactions of               lin-29 protein with predicted target genes:  The stage-specific                 expression of the cuticle collagen genes, col-17 and col-19, will               be analyzed.  col-17 expression is transcriptionally repressed                  during the larval/adult switch, whereas col-19 expression is                    activated.  The role of lin-29 in the alternative repression and                activation of these genes will be tested.  \u01312! Differential                     hybridization screens to identify genes whose expression is                     influenced by the presence or absence of lin-29 protein:  Genes                 isolated in this fashion will be examined for direct regulation by              lin-29, and those directly regulated will be characterized further.             \u01313! Development of a protein-DNA UV crosslinking method to isolate              DNA sequences bound by a specific protein in vivo:  In the future,              this method will be used to identify genes bound by lin-29 protein              in vivo, and should also be applicable to the isolation of genes                controlled by other C. elegans gene-regulatory proteins.  Genes                 involved in cell cycle exit and cell fusion, as well as additional              stage-specifically expressed cuticle genes, should be identified by             these methods.  Analysis of the types of genes regulated by lin-29              in vivo will lead to an understanding of how a complex terminal                 differentiation program is orchestrated at a specific time during               development.",
