 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308583  Strauss  Professor Strauss, of Colorado State University, will continue  to investigate weakly coordinating anions with funding from the  Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry Program.  New target anions will be polyfluorinated species such as   Sb(OTeF5)6 -,  Sb(OC(CF3)3)6 -, and analogous anions having  Ti4+ and other cations as central atoms.  Stable salts of these  anions will be prepared, characterized, and used to isolate  unusually reactive cations.  This will impact studies of  coordination complexes having very weakly coordinated ligands  (such as chloroalkanes), and it may help generate new  homogeneous catalysts.  Other target cations include silyl  cations,  Fe(por) +, and  Zr(Cp)2(Me) +.  A fourth area will be  the preparation of carbonyl complexes of the coinage group  metal cations.  %%%  Molecules that have a positive charge are called \"cations\".  When complex cations are constructed by bonding atoms or groups  of atoms to a central metal atom, this atom usually has a  preferred number of other atoms strongly bonded to it.  However, when these cations participate in chemical reactions  they can exist briefly with either a reduced number of bound  atoms or else with one bound quite weakly;  these unusual  states are crucial to the reactions, but they are difficult to  examine because of their instability.  Experiments to alleviate  these difficulties will be performed by preparing specially  unreactive anions, negatively charged species which are  required in order to balance the charge of the cations.  It is  anticipated that these new anions will permit preparation of  highly reactive cations that will elucidate fundamental  chemistry and perhaps serve as new industrial catalysts.  ***",
