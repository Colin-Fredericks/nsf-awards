 "awd_abstract_narration": "A quantitative understanding of the hydrochemical response of                   upland catchments is a fundamental goal of hydrologists and                     environmental chemists.  Such knowledge is needed to ascertain the              potential and realized effects, for example, of atmospheric                     deposition of acids and agricultural chemicals on the catchment                 (terrestrial and aquatic) ecosystems, of changes of climate on                  water quality, and of the role of hydrology in the transport of                 heavy metals and other trace contaminants.  In particular, an                   improved understanding of the factors controlling the variation of              dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in headwater streams is of                       scientific concern for at least two reasons.  First, the overall                carbon budget of lotic systems is of primary interest to aquatic                ecologists seeking a fundamental scientific understanding of these              systems.  Second, DOC interacts strongly with other dissolved                   substances (heavy metals in particular) and therefore plays an                  important role in the transport of contaminants in streams.                     Heterogeneities in the amount of precipitation delivered to the                 surface of a catchment, in soil properties and vegetation coverage,             and in incident solar radiation can pay an important role in the                hydrological response of mountainous catchments.  These                         heterogeneities may be particularly important in influencing how                chemicals (e.g., DOC) are delivered from the terrestrial catchment              to the stream.  Complete characterization of heterogeneities over               a catchment is essentially impossible, but is likely to be                      unnecessary for descriptions of hydrochemical dynamics at the scale             of a whole catchment. A possibly fruitful hypothesis is that the                heterogeneities that dominate the catchment response are relatively             large scale and hence can be identified from readily available                  data--topography, aerial photography, and satellite imagery -- in               conjunction with a modest data-collection program in the field.                 The proposed work will explore this idea.  The effects of spatial               patterns in topography, vegetation cover, snow accumulation and                 melt, and soil transmissivity on the hydrochemical response of the              Snake River in Summit County, Colorado will be determined.  Spatial             data will be analyzed using techniques embodied within geographic               information systems (GIS) and synthesized in the context of a                   hydrological model (TOPMODEL)  that will be modified to take into               account the identified landscape-scale heterogeneities.  Field data             on precipitation, flow, hydraulic conductivity, and dissolved                   constituents (sulfate and DOC, in particular) will be used to                   evaluate the working hypothesis of the links between large-scale                heterogeneity, hydrology, and hydrochemical response.",
