The REU program will be                   conducted in conjunction with an ongoing Undergraduate Summer                   Research Program, sponsored by the Texas Engineering Experiment                 Station for the past ten years, and the Minority Engineering                    Program.  Students for the REU program will be selected from                    institutions that have predominantly minority enrollments including             the University of Texas at El Paso, University of Texas at San                  Antonio, University of Texas Pan American, University of Puerto                 Rico, Trinity University, and Prairie View A&M University as well               as Texas A&M University, with at least half from other                          institutions.  Individual research projects will be undertaken by               the undergraduate students in conjunction with on-going research                programs, and regular faculty involved in these programs will serve             as advisors for the participants' research activities.",
