 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315856  Goldfinger  This award will fund a project to investigate a fundamental  problem in neuroscience: information propagation in branched  axons.  Anatomical and physiological data suggest that  axonal arborizations are efficient regions for neuronal  signal propagation; however, theoretical studies have found  that low safety factors for impulse conduction occur in  these regions.  This study will reexamine the theoretical  studies and use a new approach to solve the impulse  propagation problem.    This proposal was submitted to the Biosystems Analysis and  Control Initiative which encouraged the submission of  proposals that through the study of neurophysiological  systems could advance engineering science and advance the  knowledge of biological systems through the use of  engineering analysis techniques.  The research being funded  by this award has the potential to further the understanding  of a basic  neurophysiological phenomena and advance the  field of engineering in the area of computational methods.  ***",
