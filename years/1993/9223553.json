 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will plan and test an intensive engineering ethics                 short course for engineering faculty.  The course will take the                 form of a two to three day summer workshop, a fall seminar                      series, and a capstone half day workshop in January 1994.  These                activities emphasize case studies, role plays, the development of               communication skills, team teaching and application of both                     analytical and creative thinking to arrive at solutions of                      problems in engineering ethics.  The course will train                          engineering faculty to teach discussion sections in the                         engineering ethics course at Texas A&M.  This 3 credit, elective                course is soon to be required of most engineering undergraduates                at the university, and could involve as many as 800 students each               year.  The short course would expose 25 faculty to most of the                  material covered in the course and enable them to assign and                    grade coursework, lead discussions, and set the tone of the                     course.  As a result, these instructors will be prepared to make                writing assignments, grade student papers, lead class discussion,               and set the tone of the course.  They will also be better                       prepared to introduce ethics case study narratives into their own               engineering courses.  Several engineering faculty from other                    campuses of the Texas A&M system will also be invited to                        participate in the short course.  Faculty for the course will                   come from Texas A&M, and from several other universities where                  courses similar to theirs are in existence.  These faculty may                  develop similar training short courses at their own institutions.               The short course could also be offered as a professional                        development activity at professional society meetings on a                      tuition, self supporting basis.",
