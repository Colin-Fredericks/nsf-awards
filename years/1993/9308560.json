The project will result  in a sequential picture of life events from childhood to adulthood  in four dimensions -- crime, criminal justice sanctions (e.g.,  arrest, incarceration), employment and marriage.  Based on an age-  graded theory of social control, the focus is on how the sequencing  of sanctioning, employment and marital events are related to  changes and turning points in the criminal career.  A major  hypothesis is that sequences of incarceration followed by job  instability produce distinct turning points toward crime.  By  developing and extending new optimal-matching methods for detecting  resemblance in sequence data, the project seeks to establish  whether or not there are critical stages of the life course that  turn criminal careers in particular directions.      The data for this project stem from a classic longitudinal study  (by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck) of 500 delinquents and 500  nondelinquents followed from adolescence to age 32.  These data  will be reconstructed by the research team for the purpose of this  new kind of analysis.  Life records of the sequencing of job and  marital histories will be coded and analyzed in conjunction with  more recent data on criminal careers up to age 45.  The proposed  methodology of \"optimal matching\" aims to detect distinct patterns  of crime associated with salient events over the course of life.  ***",
