 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311567  Kennedy  Dr. Kennedy is examining the conceptual foundations of the new  theories in physics which describe quarks, the so-called `gauge  theories.'  Gauge theory is a dizzyingly exotic theory of the  underbelly of our physical world.  Quarks are laden with properties  like `charm' and `flavor,' but are so absolutely imprisoned within  protons and neutrons that direct observation seems foreclosed.   Gauge theorists seriously debate the prospect that these quarks  reside in a world which consists not of the mere three spatial  dimensions plus time, but of seven or even eleven dimensions.   These fantastical proposals seem all the more strange for being  derived from a venerable, but odd principle inherited from  classical mechanics.  Eugene Wigner has styled the principle of  `gauge invariance,' as the equivalent of introducing the `location  of a ghost' into the theory's equations but then requiring that all  predictions remain undisturbed.  This odd procedure is the core of  the theory.      To date, philosophers of physics have failed to evaluate and apply  gauge theoretic advances in the fierce debates now being waged.   Dr. Kennedy, under this grant, is pioneering the philosophical  study of gauge theories.  In the course of his research, he plans  to interview leading theorists in gauge theory.  His research is  concentrated in the geometrization of gauge theories and the  bearing of gauge theory on non-locality debates.  He hopes to  resolve whether the model of the physical world that gauge theory  presents does in fact resolve some central and long-standing  questions about action at a distance.  He is undertaking this  research with Jeremy Butterfield and Micheal Redhead at Cambridge  University.   ***",
