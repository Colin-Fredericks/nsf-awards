But its potential  in many publication arenas, although sensed by the \"early adopters\"   in fields such as elementary and secondary education and health  care delivery, is not well understood yet.  Who is using it?  How  are they using it?  Can we document the benefits?  And what is the  case for public investment in the NREN and the national information  infrastructure?       The goal of this project is to collect anecdotal descriptions  - \"stories\" -from a range of users about how Internet access has  improved their access to information and services.  This collection  of \"stories\" will help document the benefits of the Internet and  will create a pools of candidates for further study.  It will also  assist the foundation and other Federal Agencies, as well as  legislators, policy makers and Internet users, in locating  particular types of users and application.       The stories will be made available in one or more Internet  information servers, using technologies such as Gopher, WAIS, and  BRS.  They will also be published in an illustrated booklet which  will be distributed at no charge to a wide audience.  ***",
