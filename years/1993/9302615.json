The goal of this research is to explore the potential of natural  language processing in automated information retrieval from large,  minimally structured text libraries.  This effort includes  development of more effective techniques of indexing, routing,  contents approximation, abstracting and creation of hierarchical  domain maps from textual data.  Both linguistic and statistical  methods are used.  The main trust is to find satisfactory solutions  to the following problems: (1) obtaining an accurate and versatile  representation of database contents for search purposes; and (2)  devising algorithms that can accomplish this task with the speed  and robustness to match or exceed that of statistical systems.  In  order to create an accurate representation of database contents  that would be able to support various types of search, an extensive  natural language processing component is created.  Linguistic  processing includes stochastic part of speech tagging, dictionary-  assisted stemming, syntactic parsing, phrase extraction and  disambiguation, and semantic correlation of concepts underlying the  database domain.  This research is based extensively on empirical  experiments with large text collections.  It is expected to produce  technologies that will significantly improve the expected  performance levels for top-of-the-line full-text information  retrieval systems.   ***",
