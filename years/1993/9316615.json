Very little  is known, however, about how people use the risk information  available to them to make sense of risky situations.  This  project is to investigate how residents of Milwaukee rely on  their personal experience, and on the various mass and  interpersonal communications channels to develop their knowledge  and level of worry about tap-water borne parasitic disease  (cryptosporidiosis) in the wake of a recent widespread outbreak  in their city.  A random sample survey will be conducted by  telephone of 500 adults who live in the affected part of the  Milwaukee metropolitan area.  Since it is essential to gather the  data while personal memories of the experience with  cryptosporidiosis are fresh, while the outbreak is still  highlighted in the mass media, and while uncertainty still  remains about possible recurrences, this proposal is funded by  the Small Grants for Exploratory Research.  This effort is  conducted to prepare a more extensive research proposal that will  examine how people select and process information to cope with  risks in the world around them using an audience-based rather  than a sender-based approach to investigate risk communication.   ***",
