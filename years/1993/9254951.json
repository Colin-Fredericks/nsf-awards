 "awd_abstract_narration": "PEPP proposes to install a simple seismograph in schools and                    colleges, to create a computer network to share data and                        information, and to form a network of supporting IRIS-members* to               train and support science teachers.  The main goals are:                                                                                                        .  To develop \"hands on\" seismological equipment for use at high                     schools and colleges, to increase the curiosity of students                     to explain nature,                                                         .  To increase the understanding of physical concepts through                        connected lab experiments, while developing a sense of                          familiarity with the seismometer as an instrument based on                      these concepts,                                                            .  To train teachers to do real \"classroom science\" with their                       students and provide scientific back-up for these                               activities,                                                                .  To stimulate interaction between teachers in Earth sciences                       and physics with researchers in geophysics,                                .  To give teachers organizational and intellectual support by                       providing materials, computer networking as well as research                    opportunities,                                                             .  To disseminate PEPP nationally and build a unique                                 seismological array that allows students and teachers to                        make real discoveries.                                                                                                                                     Rather than stop at the classroom \"demonstration\" level, PEPP                   tries to extend all the way towards real science.  This unique                  feature of PEPP will greatly contribute towards the enthusiasm of               both students and teachers.  It will take three years to develop                the first PEPP modules with the necessary infrastructure and to                 show the feasibility in a pilot project before moving on to a                   final project at national scale.",
