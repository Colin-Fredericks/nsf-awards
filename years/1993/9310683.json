The  investigators have already developed a number of promising   procedures for characterizing time-varying risk in asset markets.   Two of the most popular strategies adopted by researchers and  practitioners to accommodate this time- varying risk are rolling  regressions and ARCH  models.  The research to be undertaken with  this award will involve further development and refining of both  these strategies.  This continued line of research is extremely  valuable because measuring asset riskiness is of fundamental  importance both for investment theory and practice.  ***   9310331  Foster  This collaborative project continues a line of research aimed at  developing better measures of risk in financial markets.
