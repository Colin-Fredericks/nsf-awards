 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303478  Simpson       This project addresses a controversial question in the  foundations of mathematics.  The orthodox view (e.g. Bourbaki)  holds that the ultimate axiomatic foundation for mathematics is  set-theoretical.  However, it is also clear that set theory  itself is concerned mainly with objects (pathological subsets of  the real line, large cardinals, etc.) which are rather far  removed from ordinary mathematics (analysis, algebra,  combinatorics, etc.).  The question which drives this project is:   Which set existence axioms are actually needed to prove specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics?  This question has been  investigated in the context of subsystems of second order  arithmetic, because:  (1) the language of second order arithmetic  is just rich enough to accommodate the bulk of ordinary  mathematical practice; and (2) subsystems of second order  arithmetic embody a detailed classification of set existence  axioms according to \"logical strength\" as measured by proof  theoretic ordinals.  It turns out that, for many specific  theorems of ordinary mathematics, one can precisely determine the  weakest subsystem of second order arithmetic in which the  given theorem is provable.  Furthermore, the subsystems which  arise in this way are few in number and correspond to certain  alternative foundational programs such as recursive analysis  (Myhill-Specker), predicativity (Weyl), predicative reductionism  (Kreisel-Feferman-Friedman), and finitisic reductionism  (Hilbert).  The study of subsystems of second order arithmetic  and their role in the foundations of mathematics has been  vigorously pursued by Stephen G. Simpson, the Principal  Investigator in this project, who is also in the final stages of  writing a book which covers the entire subject.  Some specific  questions which Simpson is currently investigating are: Which set  existence axioms are needed to prove basic theorems in countable  combinatorics (e.g. the dual Ramsey theorem of Carlson and  Simpson, and Laver's th eorem on embeddability of countable linear  orderings) and in Borel combinatorics?  Which set existence  axioms are needed to prove basic theorems of dynamical systems  theory?  Which set existence axioms are needed to prove Lebesgue  measurability of analytic sets?      This project is concerned  with the foundations and logical structure of mathematics.  The  orthodox view, promulgated by the Bourbaki school among others,  is that the ultimate foundation of mathematics is set  theoretical.  This view was basic to the \"New Math\" experiment of  the 1960's.  The research in this project tends to show that, in  certain respects, the orthodox view is incorrect and the  foundational claims of set theory are unwarranted.   Through systematic investigation of the relationships between  axioms and theorems, it emerges that carefully chosen systems of  second order arithmetic provide a logically more appropriate  foundation for mathematics.  ***",
