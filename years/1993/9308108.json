 "awd_abstract_narration": "A coarse-grained data flow (CGD) virtual machine model of                       computing for the development of a programming environment                      for parallel programs on MIMD architectures will be                             investigated. This paradigm will be evaluated using three                       criteria:  (a) portability across a wide range of parallel                      architectures, and (b) effective support for performance                        monitoring and debugging, and (c) ease of use.  To study the                    portability of this paradigm, Charm, a run time system for                      portable parallel programming on MIMD architectures has been                    developed.  To date, numerous reallife applications have                        been implemented using Charm, thus making it an effective                       testbed.                                                                                                                                                        To study the effectiveness of CGD as a portable programming                     paradigm, Intrepid - an integrated environment for                              performance monitoring, instrumentation and debugging, will                     be developed on a network of Unix workstations.  Programs                       developed using Intrepid will be capable of running                             efficiently on a wide range of MIMD architectures without                       change.  In a single environment, Intrepid will enable the                      comparison of the performance of parallel programs on                           different MIMD computers.  This will permit the                                 identification of architectural and operating system level                      support that is required for the efficient, portable                            implementation of the CGD paradigm.",
