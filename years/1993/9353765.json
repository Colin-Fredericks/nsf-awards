 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353765         Marshall    Find Your Wings is a collaborative program based upon the research related to attracting women  and girls to science, engineering and mathematics (SEM), and retaining them in the career  pipeline, as well as upon our experience with past projects in the San Antonio area which were  dedicated to those goals.  We have drawn particularly on the recommendations of the American  Association of University Women's report, How Schools Shortchange Girls, specifically that,  \"Local schools and communities must encourage and support girls studying science and  mathematics by showcasing women role models in scientific and technical fields, disseminating  career information, and offering hands-on experiences and work groups in science and math  classes.\" The importance of role models, especially female role models, is well documented in  the literature.  Thus, we are stressing the classroom presence of scientists and engineers,  particularly women, in the aviation and aerospace fields in designing our project.  We chose the  aviation/aerospace theme as a recruiting tool to exploit girls' interest largely because of the  proximity of four local U.S. Air Force bases and several major airports.  (Stinson Field is within  the cooperating school district.)  The lack of hands-on experience for girls in hardware  experimentation is recognized as a contributing factor in their loss of interest in science in the  middle school years (AAUW, Peltz 1990).  We are attempting to remedy this by giving the girls  goal-oriented activities in areas of interest to most children, and providing them with the  materials and encouragement to successfully complete the activities.  We also stress the  application of mathematical methods and activities.       The six-week program begins with five weeks of math/science exploration built around an  aviation/aerospace theme, with two weekly sessions, one at a local elementary school after  school hours for teams of girls and adults, working together on experi ments and problem-  solving, and one at the new Math/Science Learning Academy in an area high school, which will  feature career speakers from the aviation/aerospace professions, tours, etc..  These are to be  followed by a model \"air show\" for 100-200 girls in 4-6th grades at five designated elementary  schools.  Teachers, parents, Girls Scout leaders, and others in that school district will be  encouraged to participate.  Since it is important to expose the girls to the working SEM  environment, we are scheduling field trips to a variety of aviation and aerospace research and  commercial facilities, including operating airports and a U.S. Air Force research Institute.  At  all of these locations, the use of computers in the work place are to be highlighted, recognizing  the need to increase computer acceptance an computer literacy in the target population.   Cooperating organizations also include the Edgewood Independent School District, the American  Statistical Association, The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and the Girl  Scouts.  ***",
