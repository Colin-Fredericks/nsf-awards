 "awd_abstract_narration": "9219075  Walker    There are several different types of protein phosphatases in  eukaryotic cells.  One class, the type one protein phosphatases  (PP1) are thought to be involved in the control of the cell cycle,  protein synthesis, membrane functions, and probably many other  biochemical activities.  In most multicellular organisms there are  several different isoforms of PP1.  This raises several intriguing  questions about the expression, distribution, function, and  regulation of these genes and their products.  This proposal  focuses on a multigene family encoding PP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana.   The goal of this research is to determine the pattern of expression  and relative abundance of the PP1 genes and proteins, and analyze  the regulatory subunits associated with the different PP1 isoforms.   Analysis of the PP1 genes of higher plants will enhance our  understanding of these important regulatory enzymes in a broader  biological context.  %%%  Control of cellular growth and differentiation is a complex process  that requires the integration of many different regulatory  circuits.  A common mechanism by which cellular processes are  regulated is through protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.   This reversible modification can cause activation, inactivation, or  even a subtle modulation of biochemical function.  Although protein  kinases have been studied extensively, it is evident that protein  phosphatases are equally important in controlling the biochemical  circuitry that governs a cell's function.  Analysis of the protein  phosphatase genes of higher plants will enhance our understanding  of these important regulatory enzymes in a broader biological  context.  ***",
