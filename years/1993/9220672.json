 "awd_abstract_narration": "A long-term study of tree populations in tropical and                           subtropical rain forest in Australia has been carried                           on for 29.5 years.  The objective is to elucidate the                           mechanisms that are responsible for the high diversity                          of species as well as the variety of population                                 structures (age and size distributions, spatial                                 patterns, life histories) seem in these forests.                                Trees, saplings and seedlings were identified, tagged                           and mapped in 1963-65.  In subsequent censuses between                          1963 and 1992 the growth and mortality of tagged plants                         were determined, and newly recruited tree seedlings                             recorded.  These data yield rates of recruitment,                               growth and mortality of all sizes of all species of                             trees.  Other measurements included the timing and                              location of tree-falls and light gaps and the structure                         of the overstory canopy.                                                                                                                                        It is planned to continue this study for at least                               another 2 decades, for the following reasons: 1) to                             increase the probability of measuring the effects of                            rate important events (e.g. extremes of weather,                                population explosions of different species), or of                              detecting gradual trends, which require long records;                           2) to gather information on short-term changes that                             will help to interpret long-term findings; 3) to obtain                         information over larger spatial scales to assess the                            generality off findings.  The significance of this                              research is that it should increase knowledge of the                            dynamics of rain forest, one of the most complex and                            diverse ecological communities known, which contains a                          high proportion of the world's terrestrial species.",
