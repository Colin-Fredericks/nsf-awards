 "awd_abstract_narration": "9315976  Jirsa  This project organizes and convenes a research workshop to  identify the directions and to develop strategies for NSF's  earthquake engineering and earthquake-related earth science  research in the next decade.  The objective of the workshop are  threefold:    1. To review current activities and achievements under the     National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) with a     focus on those under NSF sponsorship.    2. To examine NSF policies and management of the Earthquake     Hazard Mitigation (EHM) program and the Fundamental     Earthquake Studies (EAR), including problem-focused research,     which may enhance or limit the future role of NSF.    3. To develop recommendations, in broad terms, for areas and     programs where NSF can and should vigorously support NEHRP.    The Workshop program will be designed so that in addition to  meeting these stated objectives, it would (a) address the issues  raised in a recommendation made by the NEHRP Advisory Committee  in its report to the Congress, and (b) develop a long-range  strategic plan of research for NEHRP components at NSF.    This workshop is jointly supported by the Biological and Critical  Systems Division of the Directorate for Engineering and the Earth  Sciences Division of the Directorate for Geosciences.  ***",
