 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222474  Smith  This award provides partial support for philosophical research on  the ethical implications of flexible production technologies.   These technologies include numerically controlled tools, robots,  and other forms of information technology that are or have the  potential to change work relations in manufacturing.  This research  project examines these changes and claims about these changes from  an ethical standpoint.  Among the ethical principles that form the  basis in normative social theory for an approach to this subject  are those of individual autonomy, or freedom, and the social good,  defined as the absence of fundamental social antagonisms.  The  analytical component of the research involves a thorough review of  the empirical literature and studies of flexible production  technologies that have been published, including those from both  management and labor perspectives.  The research involves  identifying alleged consequences of ethical relevance in this  literature, including areas of agreement and disagreement about the  consequences of these technologies.  It involves clarifying the  assumptions and evidence that underly the various conclusions, and  their strengths and weaknesses.  Careful consideration of these  issues may allow the investigator to formulate conclusions that are  defensible normatively and empirically.  If this is not possible,  he may be able to make clear the kind of further empirical work  needed to resolve the normative questions.  This research will be  undertaken with regular interaction and discussions with a group of  social scientists who are doing empirical research on these issues.   Results will include publication of articles and a monograph and  presentations at professional conferences.  Results will also be  presented in more public media.  ***",
