 "awd_abstract_narration": "A series of experiments will be undertaken on clays under differing             silica, aluminum, and potassium concentrations, at temperatures                 from 25oC up to 300oC.  The new experimental technique for the                  proposed research has been thoroughly tested.  It incorporates the              dual pumping of solutions through two feeder-bombs containing                   quartz or boehmite which provide, by their equilibrium solubilities             at controlled temperatures, fixed but adjustable silica and                     aluminum concentrations in the input solutions.  In the proposed                experiments, the narrowly sized clay samples will be suspended as               fluidized bed within the reactor.  Samples of both the solid and                the solutions will then be extracted during each run to track the               reaction progress, and a variety of analytical techniques will be               used to evaluate compositional changes in the fluids and solids and             the structural state of the illite/smectite sample.  The results of             these experiments will be important in several respects.  First,                they will provide kinetic data for modeling fluid-flow and                      diagenesis on a basin scale.  In such models the release of water,              reduction in porosity, and change in fluid chemistry and pressure               associated with illitization are important processes that have to               date been highly parameterized.  Secondly, they should resolve the              mechanism of the smectite to illite transformation.  An active                  controversy persists as to whether illitization proceeds via a                  solid-state or a dissolution-reprecipitation path.  In our                      experiments, the ability to control the fluid composition and flow              rate (hence \"closedness\" of the system) allows us to assess whether             these factors affect the rates and energetics of the reaction and               whether they are dominated by mass transport of surface kinetics                through an elemental reaction or through multiple pathways.  In                 addition to its significance to the kinetics of illitization, the               work proposed here will extend the valuable equilibrium solubility              results of May et al.  (1986)and of Aja et al.  (1991a, b) on the               stabilities of phases in the K2O-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-H2O system.  The                experimental results should also resolve whether the fundamental                particle explanation is solution or a mixture of multiple phases                (e.g., Tardy and Fritz, 1981; Aagaard and Helgeson, 1983; Nadeau et             al., 1984; Garrels, 1984; and Altaner, 1988).",
