 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years physiologists in the Department of Zoology have                 made a major effort to incorporate computerized data                            acquisition as a regular component of our undergraduate                         laboratory courses. Our long-term goal is to customize data                     acquisition so that students can quickly get down to the                        business of doing physiology rather than wasting time and                       energy struggling with antiquated equipment. Student enthusiasm                 has been so exceptional that we are encouraged to continue to                   modernize undergraduate (primarily major) courses in laboratory                 physiology and in physiological ecology. A computerized \"turn-                  key\" system is being used to measure the metabolic rates of                     both aerial and aquatic animals, with capacities to measure                     small ectotherms such as insects. Metabolism is a basic                         physiological focus that is relevant to diverse aspects of                      biology. The facility is being used primarily by students doing                 original research projects (e.g., \"cost\" of locomotion in                       insects, metabolic consequences of acid rain on plankton) in                    the laboratory sections of our physiology courses. The system                   is superbly suited for a student laboratory setting. Moreover,                  it is remarkably flexible and can measure and analyze the                       instantaneous metabolic rate of animals ranging in size from                    individual Drosophila or Daphnia to humans. The equipment used                  consists of a sensitive C02 analyzer, a compatible O2 analyzer,                 dissolved O2 meter and oxygen electrode, respiration cell,                      mass-flow meter, A:D board, computer, as well as data-                          acquisition and analysis software. Students using this                          sophisticated but user-friendly system are able to explore                      physiological problems (and organisms) previously inaccessible                  to them and indeed even to most professional physiologists.                     This system is not only enhancing the physiological training of                 students, but also encouraging them to consider a research                      career in physiology.",
