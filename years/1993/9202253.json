 "awd_abstract_narration": "9202253  Smith       This is the first year of a three-year continuing award to  investigate how computer users adapt from the use of introductory  systems to the use of more advanced systems.  This study involves  not only the issues related to user adaptation but also to the  mediating effects that a computer system can provide.  The  methodology is based on comparisons of basic and advanced system  tasks in the areas of expository writing and of computer  programming.  The cross-task transfer effects are also examined, as  well as any noticeable longitudinal effects in patterns of use and  adaption over time as subjects become more familiar with the  systems.  Variations in the graphical representations of the same  structural information are also considered in the sequence of  experiments.  A methodological issue considered is the direct  examination of the effects of the subject's \"thinking-aloud\" on  potential behavioral distortions and completeness and consistency  of the protocol data.  The extension of current concepts to a more  general cognitive architecture based on cognitive modes and  strategies, applicable to a number of different intellectual tasks,  is a goal of this investigation oriented towards the eventual  development of computer systems more consistent with the manner in  which users think.",
