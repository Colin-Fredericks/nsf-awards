Building on work that has already                    been done, this planning grant includes an assessment of the                    teachers' needs, an evaluation of the network capacity, and                     the development of a strategy for full implementation in the                    form of a proposal.  Through the network, the teachers will                     be able to access vast databases in science and mathematics                     as well as mentors and other resources.
