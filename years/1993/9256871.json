 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Samuel P. Kounaves is supported by a grant from the                   Chemistry Division and the Graduatae Education and Research                     Division of NSF for a Graduate Research Traineeship Program                     which will involve four graduate students who will receive                      training in environmental chemistry.  This traineeship program                  includes participation by ten chemistry faculty at Tufts                        University who have brought together their expertise from                       traditional sub-disciplines of analytical, inorganic, physical                  and organic chemistry to produce a focussed research and                        teaching effort in environmental chemistry.  A special emphasis                 will be placed on identifying, recruiting and encouraging women                 and minority students to apply, and to actively support and                     encourage them throughout their graduate training.                              %%%                                                                             Our country's ability to produce trained scientists in the                      critical areas encompassed by environmental chemistry is not                    only vital to the health of our environment, but also to our                    scientific and economic leadership.  In order to effectively                    manage the environment we need trained chemists who can apply                   their expertise in solving environmental problems in such                       diverse areas as: control of manufacturing processes; advanced                  environmental sensor and monitoring technologies; waste                         management; biodegradation; atmospheric and water modeling of                   chemical reactions; and better energy production and storage.                   The aim of this Graduate Research Traineeship Program is to                     provide a group of Ph.D. chemists who are trained to address                    these challenging problems.",
