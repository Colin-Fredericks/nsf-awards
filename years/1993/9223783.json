 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is a continuation of an on-going research project in               the area of flame structure and kinetics in the combustion of                   chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs).  In the first half of this                     program, the research will involve modifying an existing burner                 setup to study CO flames in the presence of HCl and CH3Cl; both                 premixed and nonpremixed flames will be studied.  Velocity,                     temperature, and species concentration fields will be measured via              laser diagnostic procedures.  In addition, numerical simulations                for validation of the existing CO reaction mechanisms in the                    presence of HCl and CH3Cl will be carried out, with modifications               to previous chloromethane work being re-examined.  With the new                 flame structure measurements obtained with the expanded diagnostic              procedures, comprehensive comparisons will be made between numerics             and experiments.  In the second half of the program, the research               will involve studies of the influence of higher Cl/H ratios on                  global flame characteristics and flame structure using mixtures of              chloromethane, dichloromethane, trichloroethylene, oxygen, and                  nitrogen.  Under these highly chlorinated conditions, the existence             of two-stage flame structures will also be examined in premixed and             nonpremixed flames, again through non-intrusive mapping of the                  flame structure.  Finally, the tendency of soot formation will be               investigated in detail and possible control approaches examined.                                                                                                The experimental results are anvicipated to provide a basis for                 validation of detailed reaction mechanisms employed in the                      numerical simulation of flame structures.  Such comparisons should              provide useful insight into the oxidation mechanisms of CHCs.  In               addition, through identification of the important species and                   reaction steps via sensitivity analysis, simplified, reduced                    mechanisms can be developed to describe the chemistry of CHC                    flames; these reduced mechanisms will enable incorporation of                   realistic finite-rate chemistry models into simulation of turbulent             and/or three-dimensional flame structures found in incinerators,                with ultimate development of design capability for safe, optimal                incinerator operation.",
