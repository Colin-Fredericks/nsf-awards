 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307832  Burggren         The cardiovascular system is the first organ system to  operate in developing vertebrate embryos, and proper  establishment of its transport functions is absolutely critical  to the subsequent  normal development of all tissues and organs.  In spite of this important early role for the cardiovascular  system, the development  of its physiology remains  very poorly  understood for any vertebrate, including birds and mammals. Our  initial findings on anuran amphibians (frogs) have been highly  useful in advancing our understanding of studying the general  properties of embryonic circulations. Consequently, support has  been requested to expand our investigations of the development of  central arterial blood pressure and flow generation and its  regulation in embryos and larvae of the frog Xenopus laevis,  which has become one of the major vertebrate models in  development biology.       The major objectives of this proposal are to: 1) determine  the development of flow and pressure generation in the early  embryonic heart, and 2) to determine how external and internal  influences that lead to low tissue oxygenation and changes in  blood transport demands affect both the short-term and long-term  performance of the cardiovascular  system in embryos and beyond  to the adult.       Measurement will include recordings of the heart rate heart  output, blood pressure, peripheral resistance and heart work. The  experimental design will encompass rearing populations of  developing embryos under conditions that include short-term and  long-term exposure to low oxygen levels, and subsequently  assessing their physiological performance to determine when in  development they are most vulnerable environmental disturbance.       Our studies on physiological development and how  environmental conditions impact upon it will have very broad  applicability to both vertebrate physiology and developmental  biology, particularly in the almost complete absence of similar  published data on eit her bird or mammal embryos.  ***",
