 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is a 24 month extension of a study of decision-making             by sentencing jurors in capital cases.  The current project is                  designed to examine a recent constitutional development that                    promises to alter both the content and tone of sentencing hearings              in capital cases.  In Payne v. Tennessee (1991) the U.S. Supreme                Court held that personal characteristics of the victim and the                  emotional impact of the crime on the victim's family, friends and               community can be presented to sentencing jurors.  Since prior                   holdings of the Court had excluded such information, Payne,                     therefore, changed the rules that determine what information jurors             could hear in the sentencing phase of capital cases.  The ruling                came at the very end of the sampling time frame for the original                study.  This timing affords a unique opportunity to study the                   possible effects on juror decision processes of allowing jurors to              hear emotional \"victim impact\" testimony.                                                                                                                       Interviews will be conducted with a sample of 360 jurors (four                  randomly selected jurors each) from 90 trials conducted since the               Payne ruling became effective.  In addition to the juror                        interviews, the prosecuting and defense attorneys who tried these               cases will be interviewed and transcripts of the sentencing phase               of the trials will be obtained for data on the character of the                 evidence and arguments to which jurors were exposed, and other data             on the proceedings for comparison and statistical control.                      Completed interviews with jurors from 360 cases tried under the                 prior evidentiary rules will serve as the baseline for assessing                the effects of Payne on sentencing behavior.  The same interviewing             procedures and instruments covering juror sentencing decisions will             be used for comparability between the pre- and post-Payne cases.",
