The  participants will attend two, four week summer workshops in order  to gain an understanding of basic chemistry and physics concepts,  develop effective methods of teaching these concepts in an  integrated manner, and learn safe and appropriate methods of  operating science apparatus, as well as proper handling of  substances in classroom activities.  The workshops will features  content presentations, discussions, laboratory activities,  demonstrations, safety sessions, teaching practice, planning  outreach sessions and attention to interrelationships of these  sciences and technology. Emphasis will be placed on core topics   common to most middle  school curricula along with effective  methods for concept-based teaching using the teaching/learning  cycle, cooperative learning, and improved integration of these  sciences with other sciences and mathematics.  There will be  support offered for key physical science concepts supplemented by  specially prepared background briefs, featuring applications and  extensions of the topic.  The teachers will also get a chance to  practice with a group of students in the UNC science camp during  the summer.  The cost share is 11% of the NSF grant.   ***",
