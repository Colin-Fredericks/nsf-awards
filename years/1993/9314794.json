 "awd_abstract_narration": "9314794  Rose    This Americas Program award will support attendance of a group of  U.S. and Latin American scientists and graduate students to an  international  workshop on the  Santa Maria Volcano, Guatemala.  The  workshop, organized by Dr. William I. Rose, Michigan Technological  University, will be held in November, 1993 and will initiate a series of  collaborative research investigations, including volcanic hazard field  workshops and crisis simulations.      In 1902 the Santa Maria Volcano was the site of one of the largest  eruptions in historic times.  Through one of its vents, the volcano has  been consistently active since 1922, thus it is regarded as an excellent  site for direct observations and measurements during eruptions.  This  volcano has been designated a Decade Volcano by the International  Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth's Interior  (IAVCEI) as part of the International Decade for Natural Disaster  Reduction.    The many potential research topics arising from the  activity of this volcano will serve to attract scientists from all over the  world to work at this site.                                   ***",
