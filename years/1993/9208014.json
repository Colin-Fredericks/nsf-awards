 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dispersal is a major life history characteristic composed of many               interacting traits.  Most arguments about the evolution of                      dispersal patterns assume that there is significant genetic                     variation for these traits and genetically covary with other traits             that are influenced by natural selection.  A major difficulty in                understanding the evolution of dispersal patterns has been the                  inability to quantify individual differences in those biological                parameters contributing to dispersal potential.  In the marine                  slipper snail, Crepidula fornicata, the principal biological trait              governing dispersal capacity is the duration of a free-swimming                 larval stage.  Larval of Crepidula must develop in the plankton for             one to several weeks before becoming capable of metamorphosing to               the sedentary  juvenile stage.  This period of obligatory dispersal             can now be quantified for individual larvae.  We propose to                     determine the quantitative genetic covariance with other larval and             post-metamorphic traits that have been previously proposed to                   influence the development of metamorphic competence and fitness                 variation.  We will specifically test the hypothesis that dispersal             capacity may evolve through its genetic correlation with other                  traits that are subject to natural selection.",
