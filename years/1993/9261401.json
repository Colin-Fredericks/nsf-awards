 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine the permeability and selectivity for                    gas transport of isotropic polymeric membranes made of                          poly(trimethyl silylpropyne) (PTMSP; \u0131C(CH3)=C(SiCH3)3!n).                      Previous research on PTMSP membranes have shown that because                    of their large free volume, the solubility and diffusivity of                   gas molecules through the membrane is very large, and this                      results in a very high gas permeability.  The high                              permeability is accompanied by relatively low selectivity                       (i.e. the ration of the flux of one species to that of the                      other).  This lack of selectivity can be attributed again to                    the large free volume size which facilitates the easy passage                   of molecules of all sizes.  Consequently, to date PTMSP                         membranes have not been of practical value in gas separations.                  The research points out, however, that the selectivity has                      been measured by passing pure gases through the membrane and                    taking the flux ratio under identical driving conditions.                       Recent experiments have shown that the membrane exhibits                        selectivity in co-permeation:  In particular experiments at                     MTR demonstrate a 27:1 selectivity on n-butane in an n-                         butane/methane mixture at 24oC.  The result of this research                    will be built by studying pure and mixed gas transport in                       PTMSP with a series of permanent gases such as methane or air,                  and closely related organic solvent vapors (CCl4, CF4, a                        series of freons and with hydrocarbon vapors such as butane                     and pentane if successful, the research will lead to membranes                  which can separate butane from methane (important in the                        natural gas industry), and organic vapors from air (an                          important separation in many environmental concerns).",
