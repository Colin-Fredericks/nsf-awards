These two  Departments currently have strong links, in terms of both  educational and research programs, through the MIT Center for  Global Change Science.    The proposed traineeship program is focused on educating earth  scientists in the observation, analysis and modeling of physical  processes governing the hydrologic cycle and the climate  system.   Investigations on the role of clouds, vegetation, land-surface  processes and atmospheric transport mechanisms are key to the  international, national and Institute-wide initiatives on the  scientific analysis of Global change and the definition of  sustainable development.    The MIT proposal is strongly focused on training and education at  both undergraduate and graduate levels.  The proposed MIT training  program in the hydrologic sciences will include: l)  multidisciplinary graduate education, 2) experience with integrated  analys9s-observation-recruitment and retention in the Environmental  Engineering and Water Resources Division will be included.  ***",
