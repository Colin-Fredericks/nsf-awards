 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309927  West    Data-mining or over-fitting, perhaps as a result of repeated  profession-wide use of a limited body of data, leads at times to  spuriously good in sample fits.  Some economists have argued that  out of sample predictive accuracy is the critical measure of  model quality.  Unfortunately most empirical work in economics  relies mainly on in-sample evidence.  Many of the out of sample  tests of predictions and predictive accuracy are informal and  qualitative in part because applied researchers find procedures  developed to date inadequate.  Procedures that have worked well  in sample also do not appear to work well out of sample.  One  contribution of this project comes from developing new procedures  for econometric inference about out of sample predictions and  prediction errors general enough to be useful in a wide range of  applications, including eventually models of the socioeconomic  impacts of global environmental change.  An earlier study found  that complicated models of exchange rates with good in-sample fit  do no better than a random walk model in out of sample  predictions.  This project uses these procedures to study the  predictive ability of competing models of exchange rate  volatility and develops alternative models, including one that  links exchange rates to interest rates.     The final area of research for this project is on empirical  inventory models.  In one part of the research, asymptotic theory  and simulation methods will be used to evaluate alternative  methods for estimating inventory models.  Issues include  sensitivity to normalization, finite sample behavior of efficient  GMM estimators, and the tradeoff between what has been called  \"exogeneity\" and \"relevance\" in choice of instruments.  The  results will be relevant in estimation of not just inventory but  other time series models as well.  In a second part, inventory  models will be estimated on two digit U.S., U.K., Canadian and  Japanese data, using the results of the first part.  Questi ons to  be studied include convexity of cost functions, dynamic responses  to shocks, and the importance of idiosyncratic versus aggregate  shocks.",
