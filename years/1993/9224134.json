 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor John Verkade of Iowa State University will                            investigate \"atrane\" coordination compounds with support from                   the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program.  These                 are highly symmetrical compounds with polycyclic alkoxide and                   amide-type ligands.  One class of compounds will place the                      metal center in a C3v environment with an axial amine.  The                     other class will be similar, but with a C2v (quasi-fourfold)                    environment.  Both transition metal and main-group metal                        centers will be used.  The initial studies will focus on                        synthesis of these interesting species.  Verkade will also                      conduct mechanistic studies of their transmetallations, axial                   ligand displacements, and other reactions.  An unusual                          technique to be employed will be 119Sn, 51V, and 73Ge NMR                       spectroscopy.                                                                   %%%                                                                             \"Atranes\" are an interesting class of compounds in which a                      central metal atom is bound symmetrically to three or four                      oxygen atoms in a plane, while a nitrogen atom is bound                         axially.  In such compounds the central metal can be                            systematically varied, as can other features of the molecules.                  Their high symmetry endows them with high volatility, which                     provides an unusual mechanism for transporting the central                      metal atom.  The synthesis of such compounds, as well as a                      study of their reactivity is the subject of the present grant.",
