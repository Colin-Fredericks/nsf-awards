Analogical similarity depends on overlap in the underlying  structure of situations, such as a common theme shared by two  stories or a common goal structure underlying two different  problems.  Such \"deep\" similarities can be distinguished from more  superficial types of overlap, such as similar characters and events  in stories or similar objects involved in problems.  Previous  research has shown that access to memories is strongly influenced  by such surface similarities, but has generally failed to find  evidence that deeper types of similarity can allow one situation to  trigger reminding of another.  This project will use a variety of  more sensitive measures to determine whether and when human memory  is guided by deep as well as superficial similarities between  complex situations.    The influences of different types of similarity will be  investigated by experiments in which college students process a  series of stories in a context that does not make it apparent that  a memory test will follow.  After a delay ranging from a few  minutes to a week, the subjects will be cued with other stories  that differ in their similarity relations to the target stories in  memory.  In some cases a cue will be related to multiple target  stories in memory.  It is expected that  the retrieval competition  triggered by having multiple related targets in memory (a situation  more in keeping with everyday experience that is the paradigm used  in previous studies) will greatly improve the sensitivity of  reminding to analogical similarity.  Other experiments will use  more indirect measures to determine which types of similarity  influence the way in which information is processed spontaneously.   These studies will determine whether reading a story that is  similar at a deep level, a surface level, or both, will render a  subsequent story more comprehens ible, or decrease the time required  to read and understand it.    These experiments will provide knowledge important for several  related topics.  Few current models of memory retrieval can account  for an influence of deep similarity on reminding.  If the project  reveals that analogical similarity indeed influences memory access,  this evidence would place important constraints on any adequate  theory of the way complex knowledge is represented in and accessed  from human memory.  The results will also provide guidance for  efforts to devise more psychologically realistic computer-based  models of memory retrieval.  In addition, sensitivity to analogical  similarity can provide a basis for flexible learning and transfer  in problem solving.  The results are therefore likely to have  important implications for training and education.    ***",
