The two                                    Pakistani scientists are Dr. R.A. Tahirkheli of                                 the University of Peshawar, and Mr. S.R.                                        Poonegar of the Department of Water and Power                                   in Pakistan.  They plan to visit Drs. R.                                        Lillie, R. Lawrence, and R. Yeats at Oregon                                     State University; Dr. Gary Johnson at Dartmouth                                 College, as well as other scientists at the                                     University of Southern California and the                                       University of Nebraska.  During these visits,                                   the scientists will work to finalize a regional                                 geological map of the northwestern sector of                                    the Indo-Kohistan and Eurasian Plates in                                        Pakistan.  A map at 1:1,000,000 scale is                                        currently not available for Northwest Pakistan                                  where three mountain ranges of the world, the                                   Himalayas, Karakorum, and Hindu Kush, meet.                                     U.S. scientists have contributed to exploring                                   this remote region in the areas of                                              sedimentology, stratigraphy, structure,                                         tectonics, seismotectonics, paleomagnetism,                                     radiometric dating, and fission track dating.                                   It is desired that information incorporated                                     into the regional geological map be checked and                                 be correct.                                                                                                                                                     Scope:  This project supports an important                                      visit by two key scientists from Pakistan who                                   can contribute greatly to the accuracy of a                                     proposed publication that will be of wide                                       scientific use.  The visit will help increase                                   collaboration between scientists of the U.S.                                    and Pakistan, and also help with opening                                        avenues to research in the area of global                                       seismic network.",
