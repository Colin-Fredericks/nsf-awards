Jaksic,                                           Universidad Catolica de Chile.  The                                             researcher's previous work has shown that small                                 mammal population varies greatly from year to                                   year whereas the abundance of large insects and                                 other foods appear to be seasonally determined.                                 The primary objective of this research is to                                    study the responses of predator assemblages to                                  this complex pattern of local variation in prey                                 densities.  Based on the nature of long-term                                    variation in the predators' use of different                                    habitat patches over the landscape, the                                         researchers will propose landscape-level                                        conservation plans that will serve to buffer                                    these predators from future local shortages in                                  their prey.                                                                                                                                                     This study is likely to yield significant                                       contributions to our knowledge of neotropical                                   guild structure and provide guidelines for the                                  design of refuges and preserves that will                                       maintain populations of wide-ranging                                            carnivores.  This is an excellent collaboration                                 in which the areas of expertise of the                                          researchers complement each other.",
