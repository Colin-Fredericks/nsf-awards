 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of electroanalytical chemistry.                   During the tenure of this three-year continuing grant, Professor                Johnson and his students will apply pulsed electrochemical                      techniques to the detection of polar and ionic aliphatic organic                compounds having biological  significance.  Of particular interest              to these studies are amino acids and peptides that contain thiol,               disulfide, or thioether moieties.  Such compounds traditionally do              not yield to conventional electrochemical analysis at noble metal               electrodes because of their electrochemical irreversibility.                    However, these functional moieties produce transient anodic                     signals at gold and platinum electrodes as a result of                          electrocatalytic reactions that occur during the formation of                   surface oxides and are thus detectable by pulsed techniques.  This              research builds upon accomplishments of the Johnson group under                 NSF grant CHE-8914700.                                                          %%%                                                                             Results from this research project will expand fundamental                      knowledge of electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms for anodic                    processes that result in water-derived oxygen transfer.                         Additionally, this research should give rise to significant                     advances in detection technology for liquid chromatography wherein              conventional photometric and fluorometric detection of the                      compounds of interest at levels less than nanomolar requires a                  priori chemical derivitization.",
