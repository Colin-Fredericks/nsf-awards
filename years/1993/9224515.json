 "awd_abstract_narration": "The producer, or intermediate business, services sector has                been one of the most dynamic in terms of job growth over the past               twenty years, and this trend is expected to continue into the                   foreseeable future.  At a national level, previous research has                 provided insights into aggregate spatial patterns of employment                 change in the producer services, but work at the level of                       individual establishments has been lacking.  Little information                 exists on how producer services firms have developed in this                    period of rapid overall growth.  Current theoretical models of                  firm dynamics derive from research on manufacturing sectors of                  the economy; there is a paucity of research to indicate whether                 the producer services behave differently or the same as                         industrial firms.  This project will test a number of theoretical               hypotheses put forward to explain the growth of these services                  through survey research on a geographically and industrially                    differentiated sample of establishments.  It will attempt to                    clarify the relative importance of externalization processes and                the changing division of labor within firms, document changes in                technology in the mode of provision of services, examine the role               of information technologies, analyze the nature of flexible                     production systems, and explain changes in the locations where                  services are sold.                                                                   Most research on spatial aspects of the restructuring of the               US economy have concentrated on industrial sectors.  This                       investigation would provide badly needed tests of current                       theoretical arguments regarding the bases of development of                     producer services.  It would provide basic knowledge of                         development processes at the level of the firm, and it would                    contribute to formulation of necessary location theory related to               services industries.  The results of this project would also                    inform public policy regarding the feasibility of services as                   substitutes for contracting resource-based industry in smaller                  and peripheral locations.",
