 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will focus in on  some problems                 involving theta functions, the Siegel-Weil formula, values and                  derivatives of L-functions and algebraic cycles on Shimura                      varieties.  A generalization of the work of Waldspurger and of                  Gross and Zagier will be attempted, together with problems that                 concern the completion of the theory of the standard L-function for             classical groups via the doubling method of Piatetski-Shapiro and               Rallis.                                                                              This is research in the field of number theory.   Number                   theory starts with the whole numbers and questions such as the                  divisibility of one whole number by another.  It is among the                   oldest fields of mathematics and it was originally pursued for                  purely aesthetic reasons.  However, within the last half century,               it has become an essential tool in developing new algorithms for                computer science and new error correcting codes for electronics.",
