 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is one of four coordinated projects that will make use of the              camp facilities established on the ice sheet in the interior of                 Greenland as part of the GISP-2 ice core drilling effort, in order              to investigate how atmospheric trace elements are deposited on the              ice and what kind of changes they undergo as they are being                     incorporated into the ice.  An understanding of such processes is               necessary in order to properly interpret the proxy climate data                 that can be recovered from ice cores.  While significant progress               has been made recently in extracting and analyzing ice cores,                   progress in understanding the air to snow transfer process for                  reactive chemical species has lagged behind.                                                                                                                    The major goal of this project is to understand the reasons for                 changes in the composition of snow at or near the surface of the                Greenland ice sheet that are observed to occur within days or weeks             after deposition.  It is known that the concentration of soluble                ionic species and aerosol-associated species may change rapidly                 with time, but the variability may be masked by small-scale spatial             heterogeneity.  A sampling protocol will be set up to characterize              the spatial variability on the one meter to one kilometer scale.                                                                                                Beryllium-7, a naturally-occurring radionuclide that is formed in               the stratosphere, will be used as an indicator for small aerosol                particles.  Its close association with atmospheric particulates and             half-life of 53 days make it a useful tracer of the incorporation               of aerosols in the snow and their post-depositional redistribution              within the snowpack",
