 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a theoretical renewal grant under the Research at                       Undergraduate Institutions program.  The principal investigator                 will complete the theory and derivation of the group theoretical                and crystallographic properties of the non-magnetic subperiodic                 groups, i.e., the layer, rod and frieze groups, and the                         relationships between the subperiodic groups and space groups.  In              particular, so called scanning tables will provide the relationship             between space groups and layer groups.  This work will be published             by the International Union of Crystallography in their series of                International Tables For Crystallography, and set the standards for             these groups for the international crystallographic and physics                 communities.  The tensorial physical properties which distinguish               domains of ferroic crystals will be determined.  The scanning                   tables will provide a basis for a study to determine the layer                  group symmetry and properties of domain twins.  The study of these              groups will be extended to include the theory and derivation of the             group theoretical and crystallographic properties of magnetic                   subperiodic groups.  The tensorial physical property distinction of             domains based on their magnetic symmetry will then be considered.               This will provide the basis for a study of the magnetic layer group             symmetry and properties of magnetic domain twins.                               %%%                                                                             The research funded through the NSF program for Research at                     Undergraduate Institutions involves developing the theory and                   deriving the properties associated with certain types of symmetry               groups.  These results will be readily available through the tables             to be published as a result of this work and will assist                        researchers in group theory, crystallography, condensed matter                  physics and materials science.",
