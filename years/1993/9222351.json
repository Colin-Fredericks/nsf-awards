 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Jay K. Kochi at the University of                  Houston. The study will develop general concepts of chemical                    reactivity based on electron donor-acceptor interactions. The three             principal methodologies in which electron-transfer will be induced              are (a) chemical oxidants and reducing reagents, (b)                            electrochemical oxidation and reduction, and (c) photochemical                  quenching and charge-transfer excitation. Specifically, work will               be carried out on: (1) application of the charge-transfer                       formulation to organic activation; (2) photo-induced electron                   transfer in charge-transfer ion pairs; (3) oxometals in high                    oxidation states as electron acceptors, (4) charge-transfer                     activation of hydrocarbon donors on metal oxide surfaces; (5)                   organometallic charge-transfer crystals and polymers.                           %%%                                                                             In this project by Professor Jay K. Kochi the broad applicability               of the electron donor-acceptor concept to a variety of organic and              organometallic systems will be exploited to develop new synthetic               procedures as well as catalytic oxidations both in solution and in              the solid state. The utilization of the charge-transfer phenomenon              in chemical dynamics especially of transient ions and radicals in               solution and with potential application to solar energy storage and             molecular memories and switches is included. The synthesis of                   various types of solid state charge-transfer complexes will be                  conducted because of their semiconductor and ferromagnetic behavior             as well as their unusual optical and magnetic properties.",
