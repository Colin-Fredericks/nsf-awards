 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Patrick J. Farmer has been awarded a Postdoctoral Research                  Fellowship in Chemistry. Dr. Farmer's doctoral degree was from                  Texas A&M University under the supervision of Professor                         Marcetta Darensbourg. Dr. Farmer will continue research at the                  California Institute of Technology under the sponsorship of                     Professor Harry Gray. Dr. Farmer's Postdoctoral training will                   provide him with bioinorganic expertise in metal-DNA                            interactions, cytochrome c oxidase, protein structure and                       function, metal porphyrin chemistry, and electron transfer                      through proteins. Longer term, he plans to synthesize well                      defined porphyrin ligand-metal systems in which the relative                    angle between donor and acceptor sites can be altered by                        bridging moieties. In this way, the directionality of electron                  transfer between ligand and metal sites can be determined.                      %%%                                                                             The Postdoctoral Research Fellowships in Chemistry Program is                   viewed as an important infrastructural program designed to                      broaden the knowledge and experience of new Ph.D.s and attract                  them into meaningful careers in contemporary chemical research                  and teaching.",
