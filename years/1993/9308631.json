 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308631  Michaylov  The Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) languages are a class  declarative programming languages based on the paradigm of rule  based constraint programming.  This project concerns the  development of practical techniques for highly-optimizing  compilation of CLP languages.  To obtain good performance, it is  necessary for a compiler to  perform optimizations based on  global properties of programs, because of the high-level nature  of these languages.    This study will concentrate on compiling the language CLP(R),  although many of the techniques will be applicable to other CLP  languages.  Program analysis for CLP languages has been studied  extensively, and the investigator has developed an abstract  machine for executing CLP(R) efficiently, given a suitable  optimizing compiler.  This project will address the questions of  which information provided by analyzers is actually useful for  obtaining efficient code for realistic programs, what compilation  techniques are needed for obtaining the code given this  information, and how such compilation can be made scalable and  reliable.    The study will build on the investigator's work on CLP  implementation issues.  It will lead to a greatly increased  understanding of the use of global program analysis as the basis  for a highly optimizing CLP(R) compiler, and demonstrate its  feasibility for the first time through the implementation of such  a compiler.  It will provide a much needed tool that can easily  be used by researchers in program analysis to evaluate their work  empirically, and will help to identify outstanding research  issues in high-performance compilation of CLP languages.  ***",
