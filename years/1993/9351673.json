 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department of Muhlenberg College is developing a                    workshop physics approach to the General Physics course.  The                   courses meet exclusively in the laboratory where students                       explore topics by performing a large number of computer                         assisted experiments.  Students learn by doing, while formal                    lectures have been abandoned.  In the past students generally                   played a very passive role in lecture courses and with this                     approach students are more involved in the learning process.                    They make the decisions on what variations of the basic                         experiments to perform, allowing students with different                        interests to explore different aspects of the topic being                       studied.  The course is structured around the computer                          interface Series 6500 system from Pasco Scientific, which also                  has a wide variety of compatible equipment specifically                         designed for the introductory lab.  We are phasing the new                      course in for all general physics students over a two to three                  year period.",
