 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310484  Popper    This U.S.-Russian Workshop on Comparative Sensory Biology is organized by dr. Arthur N.  Popper of the University of Maryland, College Park and Dr. Mikhail A. Ostrovsky of the  Institute of Chemical Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences and professor at Moscow  State University.  In past years, it has become apparent that different animal species have  evolved the ability to extract a good deal of sensory information within their environment.   While some of these senses, such as vision and hearing, are similar in aquatic and terrestrial  animals, many aquatic animals have evolved special techniques for extracting and processing  information.  In addition to the more \"traditional\" senses, the lateral line and electroreception  are found uniquely in aquatic species.  To date, there has been only a single international  meeting on sensory systems of aquatic animals and one on comparative sensory systems, in  1987.  Due to the political climate, no Russians were included in the meeting.  Only a few  Russians were included in a more general 1982 meeting.  At the same time, there has been  very active research in Russia in various areas of comparative sensory biology and evolution  of sensory systems.  Thus, this workshop will enable U.S. and Russian scientist to benefit  from the interchange of ideas and from potential bilateral collaborations.  The workshop  topics will be limited to three sensory systems: electroreception, mechanoreception (hearing  and the lateral line), and vision.    This research in zoology fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by enabling  leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary talents and pool research  resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
