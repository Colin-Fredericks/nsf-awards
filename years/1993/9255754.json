 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks funds to enhance the skills of                              mathematics and science teachers in the middle school.  The                     project is a three year program involving a total of 160                        middle school teachers in an integrated approach to                             improving science and mathematics instruction in middle                         schools.  It will provide pairs of educators, a science                         teacher and a mathematics teacher, from participating middle                    schools in the Jacksonville State University area in a six-                     week summer institute.  During the summer institute program,                    participants will take courses which will include topics in                     mathematics, and laboratory experience.  The courses will be                    taught by teams of mathematicians, educators, and a                             laboratory assisted scientists and will emphasize                               applications and ways to achieve desirable solutions and                        conclusions through skillful reading techniques.  The                           science course will allow participants to engage in hands-on                    experiments appropriate for middle school students to                           broaden their understanding of selected topics.  In                             addition, participants will attend weekly seminars involving                    the use of the latest technology in teaching.                                                                                                                   Cost sharing is equivalent to 10% of the NSF award.",
