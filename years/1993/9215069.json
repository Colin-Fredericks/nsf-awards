 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do we learn to protect ourselves from approaching danger?  One              of the oldest paradigms for studying this kind of learning is                   classical Pavlovian conditioning.  In classical conditioning, the               repeated presentation of two stimuli together, one that the                     organism normally would avoid (the unconditioned stimulus), and one             that it does not (the neutral stimulus), leads eventually to the                organism trying to avoid the neutral stimulus.  The previously                  neutral stimulus has acquired a value -- it has become conditioned.             Pavlov thought that the new associations necessary for conditioning             occur in the cerebral cortex, that part of the brain devoted to                 thinking and perception.  Dr. Thompson and his students have shown,             surprisingly, that circuits in the cerebellum, not the cerebral                 cortex, are necessary for conditioning to take place.  In this                  renewal of his NSF grant, he will use newly developed reversible                inactivation methods to demonstrate that the new associations are               actually formed in the cerebellum.  He will then use a variety of               sophisticated neurobiological techniques to determine the                       mechanisms by which these new memories are stored.  The                         investigators have a good chance of being the first to delineate a              complete information storing circuit in the mammalian brain.  Their             work will further our understanding of human learning and memory                and will be also useful to designers of artificial neural nets and              teaching machines.***//",
