 "awd_abstract_narration": "Work to be done on this project combines the mathematical theories of closed    multiple-valued, matrix valued functions.  The underlying motivation for the  studies lies in the expected significant applications to systems theory and  functional analysis. The research can be viewed from the point of view of  interpolation theory and meromorphic matrix functions, or as explicit work on the  correspondence between the Weil divisor approach and the factor of automorphy  approach to complex vector bundles over closed Riemann surfaces.  In the former  one wants to construct meromorphic matrix valued functions interpolating given  points on a closed Riemann surface.  In the latter, one takes local solutions to  form a holomorphic vector bundle and asks for conditions which guarantee that the  bundle be trivial. This is where Weil's work enters.    The work described in this project arises in systems analysis where one is  interested in selecting optimal functions from classes all of whose members  satisfy the same conditions.  The conditions may be given as prescribed pointwise  values of the functions.  It then becomes essential that one first solve the  interpolation problem to classify all such functions before establishing the  optimal ones.",
