These courses are important elements in continuum and pipeline                  issues, as well as general mathematical needs of students not                   continuing in mathematically oriented fields of studies. The                    American Mathematical Association of Two-Year Colleges (AMATYC)                 is undertaking a leadership role in designing a framework for                   systemic reform of college mathematics in the curriculum                        leading to calculus. The first stage is a meeting of an AMATYC                  National Steering Committee consisting of leaders of AMATYC,                    MAA, and NCTM as well as others actively involved in the                        development of innovative mathematics curricula and Standards                   . In the second stage a small invited conference of a National                  Task Force is being held to establish guidelines for the                        development of a set of Standards for two-year college and                      lower division mathematics and to formulate a plan to build                     consensus for mathematics reform among two-year college and                     university constituencies.",
