This project will collect documentary recordings of                as many northern Brazilian Cariban languages as possible and                    begin the process of transcribing word lists and grammatical                    information from these recordings.  The project will also provide               support for the Brazilian Cariban linguistics students to do                    intensive field work in three different northern Brazilian                      Cariban language communities.  The linguists will use traditional               field techniques, including recording, transcribing, and                        translating word lists and tests; syntactic analysis will be via                elicitation and analysis of transcribed texts.  For these three                 languages, the project will produce analyses of phonology,                      morphology, basic syntax, and papers on theoretically or                        typologically relevant issues.  With these new data, the co-PI                  will work towards a more reliable classification of the Cariban                 family and reconstruction of Proto Cariban lexicon and                          morphosyntax.                                                                                                                                                   This project is a collaborative effort, designed to help train                  new Brazilian linguists in basic linguistic description and                     historical/typological/functional approaches to linguistics.  It                will also be responsive to the needs of Cariban language                        communities, offering help in preserving their unique languages                 and cultures.//",
