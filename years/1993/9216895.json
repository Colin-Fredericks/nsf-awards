 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in neurosciences between Margaret M. Shiffrar, Rutgers                          University, and Jean Lorenceau, Experimental Psychology                         Laboratory, University of Paris.  Through a convergence of                      psychophysical, neurophysiological and computational studies, the               investigators propose to address the process of image                           interpretation in computational and biological visual systems.                  Signal fusion and fission; that is, how visual systems determine                which signals should be grouped together, and how human                         observers integrate visual motion signals across space and time,                are pivotal issues addressed by this research.                                                                                                                  Dr. Shiffrar and her colleagues bring to this collaboration                     expertise in computational studies of biological systems and the                environment for large scale computational modelling and                         simulations.  The French group will conduct complementary                       neurophysiological studies on the visual perception of motion                   coherence utilizing multi-electrode recording facilities.                       Psychophysical studies designed to measure sensitivity to                       direction of object motion will be performed jointly by both                    groups and serve as the unifying framework for the                              neurophysiological and computational methodologies.  This cross                 disciplinary approach will further understanding of the human                   visual system and applied aspects of vision research in video                   technology and robotics.",
