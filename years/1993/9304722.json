 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research is partitioned into four parts:  (1) cryptography;  (2) derandomization; (3) approximation algorithms; and   (4) parallel and  distributed algorithms.  As described below,   there are  strong interconnections and themes  that link the work in the different parts.  The interaction between  randomness and efficient computation is crucial in all  parts.  In cryptography,  randomness is crucial for hiding  information, and the interaction between  randomness and  computational power is the motivating  force behind the  definition of a pseudo-random generator.  The derandomization part explores the  development of general  methods for converting efficient randomized algorithms  into  efficient deterministic algorithms, and thus the interplay  between  randomness and efficiency is central.  The de-randomization part has strong  connections with the parallel  algorithms and approximation algorithms parts:  some of the  algorithms de-randomized are randomized parallel  algorithms,  and some are randomized approximation  algorithms.  Some of the work in  the approximation  algorithms part develops efficient randomized  approximation algorithms.    The work on the approximation algorithms is  done  jointly with the ESPRIT RAND working group.",
