The specific   areas are: (a) studies of exchange couplings in novel semi-  flexible organic biradicals by exploring the effects of   unsaturation, spacers, temperature, and solvents with the   objective to evaluate the through-bond and through-space   mechanisms; (b) studies on diffusion of organic reactive   intermediates on solid surfaces using ultra fast time-resolved   EPR spectroscopy with emphasis on determining the influence of   solvents; (c) studies using biradicals as probes of polymer chain   dynamics and photodegradation including the use of supercritical   fluids; (d) synthesis of bi- and tricyclic ketones using olefin   methathesis; and (e) improving the multiple frequency   time-resolved EPR spectroscopy methodology.  %%%  With this NYI award Professor Malcolm Forbes will conduct studies   of organic biradicals in a variety of systems that range from the   synthesis of polycyclic ketones to olefin methathesis and anionic   polymerization. The research is largely aimed at determining how   the different parts of molecular systems communicate with each   other electronically and how external factors such as solvents,   temperature, and spacers influence the diffusion, dynamics, and   exchange couplings. The work will include diffusion studies on   the solvent/solid interface and studies on photodegradable   polymers.  ***",
