 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation compares and analyzes recent and ongoing regime              transitions in Sub-Saharan Africa.  Between November, 1989, and the             end of 1992, over two-thirds of Africa's governments responded to               the demands of protesters for greater pluralism and competition                 within the polity.  For the first time in a generation, incumbent               leaders released political prisoners, tolerated the emergence of                independent newspapers, and permitted the formation of opposition               political parties.  By the end of 1992, multiparty elections had                been held in fourteen African countries and were scheduled for 1993             in a dozen more.  A peaceful democratic transition, with an                     electoral transfer of power to a new government, occurred in Zambia             and Benin, among other countries.                                               Yet Africa's regime transitions have not attracted the same                     scholarly and media attention as the democratization processes in               Eastern Europe or Latin America.  As a result, they are neither yet             fully documented nor well understood.  This project will explain                the trajectory and outcomes of political transitions in Africa,                 especially whether they conclude in a free and fair election whose              results are accepted by all contending parties.  The research asks:             why do some regimes undergo political reform while others do not?               Have political transitions followed a similar pattern or are there              major divergences in trajectories and outcomes?  Which sort of                  regimes are likely to make a peaceful transition to democracy and               which are subject to disruption and reversal?  To what extent are               political transitions in Africa similar or different to those in                other parts of the world?  How can any such differences be                      explained?  What are the long term prospects for democracy in                   Africa?                                                                         To address these questions, the investigators compile and                       disseminate a cross-national computerized database of transition                events, regime characteristics, and political resources for the                 forty seven countries of sub-Saharan Africa for the period 1989-                1994.  When completed, this database will provide a uniquely                    comprehensive and easily accessible source of information on the                political events surrounding each transition.  The completed                    database will be made available to decision makers and scholars to              let them use the database to compare and contrast the different                 national experiences and thereby increase our understanding of                  political transitions.                                                          In addition, the researchers analyze facts from the database to                 develop and test a theory of transitions in Africa.  Most                       contemporary research on democratization has focused either on the              highly contingent interaction of political actors or on deep                    socioeconomic variables.  The project starts from the premise that              political transitions can be most profitably explained with                     reference to the proximate structure of political institutions                  which delimits the opportunities and capacities of actors to shape              events in everyday politics.  This research analyzes the prospects              and problems of political transition in sub-Saharan Africa in terms             of these political-institutional variables.",
