 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223847  Newnham    This award is the initial funding for a new Materials Research  Group at the Pennsylvania State University on the topic of size  effects in ferroic solids.  Scaling phenomena in representative  oxide ferroics are being investigated theoretically and  experimentally.  Emphasis is being placed on determining the  critical sizes for the following four regimes:  (1) large  particles that each contain many domain walls which reduce in  number as the particle size decreases,  (2) particles that  contain a single domain,  (3) particle sizes smaller than a  single domain,  (4)  particles in the nanometer size scale.  The  material systems of choice are ferroelectrics, ferroelastics, and  secondary ferroics.  The goal is to determine the critical  particle sizes for each system where the material and its  behavior transitions from bulk behavior to single domain behavior  to glass-like, and non-ferroelectric behavior.  The experimental  program involves preparation of  fine-grain powders plus  ceramic/polymeric, and ceramic/ceramic composite materials in the  form of thin films;  characterization of the particle/grain  microstructure, domain configurations, phase transformations, and  critical sizes using thermal analysis, x-ray diffraction, Raman  spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and spectroscopic  ellipsometry; measurement of permittivity, elasticity, as a  function of  applied field, temperature, and frequency.  The  theory component is based on the Landau-Ginsburg-Devonshire  formalism.  The effects of volume, external surfaces, and  internal interfaces (both grain boundaries and domain walls)  are considered.    Ferroic crystals have domain walls which can be moved by electric  fields (ferroelectrics), magnetic fields (ferromagnets), mechanical   stress (ferroelastics), or some higher order phenomena involving a   combination of the first three (secondary ferroics).  These materials   are used as transducers, capacators, transformers, sensors, and actuators,   because of the lar ge contribution that domain walls make to piezoelectricity, permittivity, permeability, elastic compliance, and other property  coefficients.  A basic understanding of size effects is critical to the   development of these devices, which are being made smaller in the form   of thin films, fiber-filled composites, and multilayer ceramics with   submicron grain sizes.",
