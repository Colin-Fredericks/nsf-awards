 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project to disseminate the use of an                       effective teacher enhancement program in biology, Wisconsin                     Fast Plants, to elementary and middle school teachers,                          nationwide.                                                                                                                                                     Four different dissemination models will involve the                            presentation of teacher workshops at universities and                           colleges, local schools districts, and other institutions,                      such as museums.  Workshop leaders at these sites will                          include scientists, master teachers, science educators from                     museums and other institutions, and Wisconsin Fast Plants                       staff.  Non-staff workshop leaders have been, or will be,                       trained by the Wisconsin Fast Plants staff.                                                                                                                     The goals of the project are to 1) enhance teachers' science                    attitudes and skills; 2) train teachers to grow and use Fast                    Plants for inquiry-based instruction; 3) bring Fast Plants                      and better science instruction to underserved students; 4)                      encourage community partnerships among educators,                               scientists, and institutions; 5) expand the Fast Plants                         Network; and 6) continue to support all previous Fast Plant                     users.                                                                                                                                                          An estimated 3,000 teachers will receive training via 126                       workshops supported by the Wisconsin Fast Plants Program.                       The innovation is expected to spread to an additional 6000-                     9000 teachers as a result of the project.                                                                                                                       Cost sharing equals 21.2% of the NSF award.",
