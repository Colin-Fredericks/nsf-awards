 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of the seminar are to provide bridge engineers              from diverse backgrounds, industry, academia, or government with                a forum to assimilate, exchange, or become educated on the                      technological aspects of cable-stayed bridges.  Cable-stayed                    bridges have become a popular and cost-effective alternative to                 suspension bridges since the Second World War.  With the proven                 benefits of cable-stayed bridge crossings in the United States and              the world, still many government, consulting and academic engineers             are not investigating the use of the bridge type.  One can only                 speculate that a possible lack of understanding of cable-stayed                 bridge behavior and performance aspects are the cause.  Thus, the               seminar's major objective is to educate the attendees on the                    overall aspect of cable-stayed bridge technology.  Renowned                     speakers from the United States will lecture to participants in a               two-day seminar format tentatively set for April, 1993, in Miami,               Florida.",
