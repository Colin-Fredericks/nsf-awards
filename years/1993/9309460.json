Each nerve cell, or neuron, has a very specific pattern of axonal connections, and normal function of the nervous system depends on this specific pattern of connections. Development of the proper pattern of connections in the brain requires a precise regulation of axonal branching in the vicinity of a neuron's target cells.  The long-term goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms that regulate axonal branching in the developing nervous system. Recent studies show that neurons grow by the continuous addition and retraction of branches.  An increase in axonal branching, such as that observed after activity is blocked, might occur through a decrease in the amount of branch retraction or an increase in the amount of branch addition.  To resolve this issue, it is necessary to continuously monitor the a living axon over time.  This can now be accomplished using laser scanning confocal microscopy.  This project will determine the temporal limits for modifications of axonal structure and test the hypothesis that blocking synaptic activity increases the rate of branch initiation.  These results will provide important new insights into the mechanisms responsible for nerve cell form and function.  ***     Z   \\   ^ _ ` a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z { | } ~                                                                                                                                     9309460  Cline    Nerve cells communicate with one another via a slender cellular process called an axon.
