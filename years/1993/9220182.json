 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lev-Ari         This research aims to develop efficient model-based  techniques for non-stationary signal analysis and spectral  estimation, with a particular emphasis on Burg's maximum-entropy  approach and the order-recursive realization of linear  predictors.  The ultimate objectives are:  1.     to construct numerically-robust adaptive algorithms for  estimating the parameters of such models;  2.     to establish the statistical properties (e.g., rate of  convergence, tracking capability and steady-state error) of such  algorithms when applied to both persistent and transient non-  stationary signals; and  3.     to obtain simple procedures for recovering spectral  characterizations, such as the Wigner-Ville distribution or the  cyclic spectrum from the estimated model parameters.         Adaptive algorithms that efficiently estimate periodically-  varying model parameters associated with cyclostationary signals  have been constructed.   The ultimate goal is to extend these  results to a broader family of signals, including stationary,  cyclostationary, harmonizable, and asymptotically-mean-stationary  signals.  In particular,  multiresolution wavelet basis functions  are used to characterize the dynamics of time-varying model  parameters, leading to the construction of adaptive estimation  algorithms that are recursive in time, order and resolution.",
