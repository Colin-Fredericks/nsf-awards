Professors S.M. Chitre, of the Tata Institute                                   of Fundamental Research in Bombay and W. Saslaw                                 of the University of Virginia are the principal                                 organizers.  Galaxy distribution functions are                                  important for understanding the large scale                                     structure of matter in the Universe.  Gravity                                   is a primary influence on this distribution but                                 despite its long history, the mutual                                            interaction of large numbers of gravitating                                     objects is a difficult problem and progress in                                  areas relevant to galaxy clustering is very                                     recent.  Progress has resulted from a                                           combination of analytic physical theory,                                        computer N-body simulation, and astronomical                                    observations.  These problems, along with                                       closely related areas of physics and related                                    statistical descriptions, will be the main                                      topics of the workshop.                                                                                                                                         Scope:  Principal objectives of the workshop                                    are to review recent results related to galaxy                                  distribution functions and to coordinate future                                 collaborations between Indian and Western                                       astrophysicists studying large scale structure                                  of the Universe. There has been considerable                                    research activity in this field and increasing                                  interest among Indian astronomers resident                                      abroad in observing and analyzing galaxy                                        distributions. Exposure of the Indian                                           scientists and students to recent developments                                  will be significant for the course of research                                  on extra-galactic physics in India.  The                                        workshop is particularly timely since it will                                   soon be possible to obtain observational data                                   from the new Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope                                    under construction near Pune.",
