The                Russian participants have developed the theoretical methods and                 radio receiving equipment for phase-difference ionospheric                      tomography and have performed preliminary experiments in Russia                 which have provided an initial verification of these techniques.                In order to calibrate the resolution and accuracy of the method,                however, experiments done in conjunction with simultaneous direct               ionospheric observations are needed.  A cooperative research                    program between scientists and engineers in the US and Russia is                proposed to carry out a series of tomographic experiments in 1993               along the N-S meridian through Millstone Hill, Massachusetts.  In               conjunction with direct ionospheric observations made by the US                 participants with the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar, an               array of Russian-built ground-base satellite receivers will be                  deployed to investigate ionospheric structure using tomographic                 techniques.  The joint research will serve to both calibrate and                improve the tomographic deconvolution using the phase-difference                technique and will address the ability of radio tomography to image             small-scale ionospheric structures, beyond the resolution                       capability of the radar.",
