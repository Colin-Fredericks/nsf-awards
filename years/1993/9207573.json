 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pronounced local adaptation and genetic divergence have been found              between closely adjacent pea aphid populations on alfalfa and                   clover.  However, little is known about the balance between                     selection and gene flow that currently maintains the observed                   genetic differentiation of aphids on the two hosts.  On both hosts,             the performance of transplanted individuals is much lower than that             of residents, indicating strong disruptive selection.  Pea aphids               are capable of flying between fields of the different crops and                 specialist clones can interbreed and produce viable offspring, so               migration and gene flow are physically possible.  How much gene                 flow actually takes place?  The major questions addressed in this               proposal are (1) is the host-associated divergence maintained by                selection in the face of free gene flow between crops? and (2) if,              as we expect, gene flow is restricted, by what ecological and                   genetic mechanisms does this occur?  First, the extent of inter-                host gene flow will be determined using both direct and indirect                methods, with measures of gene flow between fields of the same crop             as a reference point.  Preliminary results suggest that populations             on the two crops are neither completely isolated nor panmictic.                 Various mechanisms that could act to limit gene flow between these              divergent populations will be then evaluated, including habitat                 choice by alate (winged) forms, selection against migrants,                     phenological separations between mating population on the two                   crops, and reduced fitness of hybrids due to developmental failure              and/or lack of adaptation to the parental environments.  The                    results of these experiments will provide a detailed view of the                mechanisms by which closely adjacent populations in different                   habitats remain genetically differentiated despite the potential to             interbreed.  This study represents a unique opportunity to study                mechanisms of local adaptation and population divergence.  These                experiments will also provide a case study of gene flow restriction             that has implications for the study of speciation, and the process              by which insect pests adapt to specific crop plants.",
