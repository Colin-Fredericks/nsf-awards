 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306720  Caflisch       Vortical and convective fluid flows are important for a wide  range of phenomena, such as fluid mixing, flow around airfoils  and obstacles, and turbulence.  In this project the investigator  undertakes research in three related topics: (1) Dynamics,  instabilities and singularity formation for axisymmetric,  swirling vortex sheets are studied through bifurcation analysis  and numerical computation, with applications to vortex breakdown.  (2) The effective diffusion rate for a convective flow is studied  for flows with randomness and time-dependence. (3) Singularities  are investigated for systems of PDE's through a combination of  PDE theory, algebraic geometry (catastrophe theory), symbolic  computation, and numerical simulation.       The research in this proposal is for analysis and  numerical computation of complex fluid flows, such as occur in  many problems of scientific and technological importance.   Effective understanding and application of these flows requires a  description of both their microscopic and their macroscopic  features.  This investigation first focuses on singularities as a  fine-scale phenomena in idealized flows.  A macroscopic  description of flows is also developed through homogenization of  the microscopic variations.  The results from this study will be  important in assessing the qualitative features of complex  flows,as well as in the development of effective computational  methods.  ***",
