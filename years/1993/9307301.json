 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Price and his             colleagues will examine the usefulness of barium as a paleodietary              indicator. Considerable research done focussing on strontium has                shown that it is discriminated against relative to calcium in                   biological systems. Therefore relatively less strontium is present              in herbivores which eat plants than in the plants themselves.                   Likewise bones of carnivores contain less strontium than do bones               of their herbivore prey. Preliminary analyses conducted by Dr.                  Price and colleagues indicate that the same holds true for barium               and that in this latter case the differences between trophic level              are even more pronounced. Relatively little is known however about              how barium moves through ecological systems and preliminary data                again indicate that the patterning is complex. Marine, arid and                 non-arid terrestrial systems all seem to act differently. In this               first stage of a planned long term project the team proposes to                 gain a better understanding of the barium cycle in a series of                  environments. They will collect samples and analyze a broad range               of species. Included within this will be anthropologically relevant             skeletal remains.                                                                                                                                               Because food is essential to human existence and subsistence and                social systems of necessity are built around this need,                         archaeologists pay a great deal of attention to the reconstruction              of prehistoric diet. This has proven extremely difficult because                various classes of food are differentially preserved in                         archaeological sites. Plants for example which formed an essential              part of prehistoric diet are rarely preserved. Chemical analysis of             bone has proven extremely useful since different diets may leave                telltale chemical fingerprints in skeletal remains. The proposed                work by Dr. Price and colleagues will help to develop a new                     technique which may yield insight not only into diet but                        paleoclimate as well.                                                                                                                                           This work is important because the technique, when developed will               provide a useful way to address a number of archaeological                      questions in many parts of the world.",
