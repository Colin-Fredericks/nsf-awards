 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Hungary research project in                                           microbiology is between Drs. Robert P. Tengerdy                                 and James Linden of Colorado State University                                   and Drs. Janos Schmidt of the Pannon                                            Agricultural University and Laszlo Nyeste of                                    the Technical University of Budapest.  This                                     project will combine the complementary                                          expertise of Hungarian and American research                                    groups in developing a new integrated                                           processing of sweet sorghum for value-added                                     products such as alcohol, protein, silage, and                                  animal feed.  The key to the integrated process                                 is a biological intervention, enzyme assisted                                   ensiling (ENLAC), that improves the storability                                 of the ensiled crop for year round processing                                   and makes possible a higher cell content                                        recovery by countercurrent diffusion.  Research                                 efforts will focus on improving the                                             extractability of sugar and protein from ENLAC                                  treated sweet sorghum and on separating                                         proteins from sugar in the extracted juice.  By                                 adjusting the engineering parameters of the                                     diffusion process, the researchers expect to                                    control the ENLAC process for maximum sugar and                                 soluable protein yields.  Results should                                        enhance the value of sweet sorghum as a crop,                                   offering a potentially profitable and                                           sustainable economic activity to farmers and                                    bioindustries in both countries.                                                                                                                                This project in microbiology fulfills the                                       program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                     complementary talents and pool resources in                                     areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
