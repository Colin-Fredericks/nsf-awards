Kappers of the University of Connecticut and                                    Dr. I. Foldvari  of the Research Laboratory for                                 Crystal Physics, Budapest is to study the                                       defect properties of nonlinear optical                                          crystals.  Specific materials to be                                             investigated include doped and undoped single                                   crystals of a new bismuth oxide, Bi2TeO5 as                                     well as other materials that possess an                                         intrinsic luminescence, (ZnWO4, Bi4Ge3O12,                                      Bi12GeO20, Bi12SiO20 and Bi12TiO20).  Single                                    crystals will be grown at the Research                                          Laboratory for Crystal Physics in Hungary using                                 the Czochralski technique while crystal                                         characterization will be performed at the                                       University of Connecticut before and after                                      electron irradiation using electron                                             paramagnetic resonance, optical and                                             spectroscopy.  The experimental efforts will                                    include studies of point defects and their                                      involvement in scintillation, photorefractive,                                  and photochromic processes in these materials.                                  Comparisons of the results for the different                                    crystals will contribute to our basic                                           understanding of these phenomena.  In addition,                                 complementary theoretical studies will build                                    upon results of the researchers' previous                                       collaboration on cluster modeling of defects in                                 paratellurite and will extend those methods to                                  Bi2TeO5.  Overall, combined results should                                      improve our knowledge of those oxide crystals                                   with properties that also have a potential for                                  applications in optical devices.                                                                                                                                This project in condensed matter physics                                        fulfills the program objectives of advancing                                    science by enabling leading experts in the U.S.                                 and Hungary to combine complementary talents                                    and pool research resources in the areas of                                     strong mutual interest and competence.",
