 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this study is to utilize historical information               in order to examine and document relationships between land use                 and the character of lakewater chemistry and phytoplankton                      biodiversity in a suite of 30 lakes.  Three sets of historical                  information will be assembled for each of the 30 waterbodies.                   The first set of data will consist of a detailed analysis of the                siliceous algal phytoplankton flora for each lake for 1934, 1970,               1990, and for pre-European settlement.  The floras will be                      determined using microfossil remains from lead-210 dated sediment               cores.  The second set of data will consist of lakewater chemical               analyses from the same time periods assembled from actual                       chemical records and/or inferred from paleolimnological inference               models.  The third set of data will consist of land use                         determinations for each surrounding watershed for 1934, 1970 and                1990, derived from high resolution aerial photographs, historical               maps and other archived land use records.  The three sets of data               will be used to correlate changes in the chemical and biological                status of each lake with measured alterations in land use for                   three time periods, the arrival of Europeans to the 1930s, the                  1930s to 1970s, and the 1970s to 1990s.                                         %%%                                                                             One of the primary causes of anthropogenic stress on aquatic                    ecosystems is the increase in solute content of runoff from                     catchment basins caused by a change in land use.  Despite this                  fact, the impacts that changing land cover patterns have on                     receiving waterbodies are poorly understood.  The availability of               detailed historical records coupled with the ability to extract                 data from the sediment record offers a rare opportunity to                      analyze the effects of land use on aquatic ecosystems.  A                       fundamental understanding of how changes from one type of land                  use to another could alter a nearby waterbody would provide a                   powerful tool for lake management.  The integration of historical               records, as outlined in this study, could serve as a model for                  similar projects in other geographic regions.",
