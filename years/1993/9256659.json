The students will be enrolled                    in one of the six participating Schools.  The traineeship                       program being administered through the Composites Education                     and Research Center(CERC), a campus-wide facility.  Georgia                     Tech has considerable depth of expertise in all technical                       areas related to composites technology, with very active                        research programs involving 25 faculty members who are                          collectively supervising 62 Ph.D. and 51 M.S. students                          (about one-half are engaged in composites research) in the                      various participating units and have considerable financial                     support from industry and government.  There are also a                         large number of composites courses available to students                        pursuing a Ph.D. degree in composites. Several of these                         courses are cross-listed and are team-taught by faculty from                    different schools.  Seven of these courses will form a set                      of required core courses to be taken by all trainees from                       all disciplines.                                                                %%%                                                                             Composite materials have extensive potential for use in                         aerospace, automotive, recreation, civil structure (highway                     and bridges), and telecommunications industries and have                        been identified in several recent federal reports as one of                     the key technologies for the future economic well being of                      the United States.  A multidisciplinary approach involving                      expertise in materials science and engineering mechanics,                       manufacturing and design is needed for the full commercial                      exploitation of these materials.  Trainees will be                              undertaking research and graduate studies in advanced                           composite materials.",
