 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309555  Grober          Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a decapeptide that  was isolated from brain in 1971 and has now been shown to exist in  at least five different multiple forms.  Further, with the  development of sophisticated antibody technology, the GnRH neuronal  network was demonstrated to be a complex, heterogenous system,  comprising three or more distinct neuronal groups and spanning  vastly different regions of the brain.  While it is known that GnRH  is involved in the control of reproductive behavior and physiology  in all vertebrates, specific functions for the different GnRH  peptides within the different brain regions have yet to be  identified.  Dr. Grober will examine a vertebrate that exhibits  exceptional levels of sexual plasticity as his model system, thus  providing an excellent opportunity to investigate how social  interactions can trigger profound behavioral and physiological  changes via the endocrine system.  He will combine molecular,  cellular and field endocrinological techniques to determine the  role of GnRH in sexual plasticity.  Dr. Grober will examine the  relationship between GnRH gene expression and changes in physiology  and behavior.  He will show where and how much GnRH is formed and  under what conditions.  This integrative approach coupled with an  unique model system will provide important insights into the role  that GnRH plays in basic mechanisms underlying reproductive  maturation, physiology and behavior.   ***",
