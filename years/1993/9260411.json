 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research suggests a new technique for fabricating high                speed steel by dispersing nanosized oxide particles instead of                  carbide precipitates within the iron-based matrix. Due to the                   chemical stability and smaller size of the oxide dispersoids, the               proposed material should exhibit high strength well above 600                   degrees C, unlike conventional high speed steels. The processes                 involved in the manufacture will be studied here, including firstly             the production of iron powder with the uniformly dispersed oxides               and secondly the consolidation of the powder by casting or standard             powder metallurgy.                                                                   Other benefits of the proposed material may be improved                    grindability and fracture toughness, due to the very small size and             greater homogeneity of the oxide dispersoids within the iron-based              matrix. Some of the high costs of conventional alloying would also              be avoided. The research method therefore offers an attractive                  alternative to producing superior high speed tooling material.",
