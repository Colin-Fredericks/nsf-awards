 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to understand the structures                and properties of muonium defect centers in semiconductors.  In                 turn this will provide a complementary picture of hydrogen in                   semiconductors, a common impurity which is difficult to study in                unreacted form.  The study of muonium permits us to learn about a               variety of deep-level defect properties, such as metastability and              bistability, local and long-range tunneling, carrier trapping, and              pairing reactions.  These topics are of considerable scientific and             technological interest but are poorly understood.  The powerful                 methods of muon spectroscopy together with the frequent occurrence              of muonium centers makes this a powerful approach to these                      problems.                                                                       %%%                                                                             The research uses a sophisticated technique (involving a short-                 lived sub-atomic particle and its interactions with its                         surroundings) to probe the properties of defects in semiconductors.             These defects are important determinants of the semiconductor                   properties and affect performance such as solar-cell efficiency.                These topics are of considerable scientific and technological                   interest but are poorly understood.",
