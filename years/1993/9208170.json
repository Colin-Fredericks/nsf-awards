 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on determining the computation power   of models of computation over the real numbers such as:   (a) linear decision trees;  (b) branching programs with linear tests; and   (c) combinational circuits of  bounded and unbounded fan-in with gates computing real functions, for the  computation of Boolean functions.  The latter models are also examined  from the aspect of approximate and exact computation of real  functions.  The goal is to prove lower bounds for explicitly defined  functions and to study the relations between different complexity  measures for these models.  This research could lead to new lower bound  arguments and it could contribute to the understanding of the  interaction between discrete and continuous aspects of computation.  In computational learning theory, extensions of previous work on concept  learning in on-line learning models are studied, as well as the  approximate learning of real functions belonging to classes defined by  smoothness or structural properties. In addition, concept learning   in structures of first-order logic is examined.   These investigations   are related to results and methods in PAC learning, information based   complexity and finite model theory.  Finally, another goal of this project   is to extend these formal learnability results to areas   often investigated in artificial intelligence.",
