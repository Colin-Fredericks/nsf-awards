 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate participation in research concentrated on remote             sensing applications to the understanding of geologic processes on              the Earth and terrestrial planets will allow students in the mid-               Atlantic region of the U.s. to take advantage of the research                   efforts underway at the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian              Institution.  Within the Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary                Studies, researchers are using data obtained from a variety of                  Earth-looking and planetary spacecraft to study aeolian processes               and real-time changes in desert environments as they relate to the              geologic record of climate change, the roughness of volcanic                    surfaces measured via radar to determine physical parameters that               are used to constrain hypotheses for the origin of similar surfaces             on Venus, and structural landforms in intraplate regions on Earth               as analogs to extraterrestrial structures.  A two-year program of               undergraduate participation is proposed to allow a close                        association between the student and mentor, and to broaden                      students' interests in, and knowledge of earth science processes.",
