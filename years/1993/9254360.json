 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a cooperative effort between the College of Education and                    the College of Engineering, various techniques will be tested                   in the basic and required course, Materials Selection, (taught                  by one of the PI's) to involve students more intensely in the                   learning process.  Among the techniques that will be used are:                  video tapes study with faculty and TA's as facilitators,                        student projects, and an interactive socratic-type classroom                    environment.  Naturalistic evaluation techniques will be                        supervised by the College of Education. Students preparing to                   become teachers of science will also be involved in the project                 as participants and later assistants in the engineering course.                 They will also be affiliated with ongoing research projects in                  materials engineering and will participate in the research                      activities.",
