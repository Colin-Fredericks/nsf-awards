 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Jeremy Sabloff, Ms. Renee Bonzani will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will analyze                    botanical and associated materials collected during archaeological              excavation at the site of San Jacinto 1 in northern Columbia. The               site is extremely important because it contains seven culturally                distinct layers dated from 6000 to 5700 B.P. (before the present)               and these include some of the oldest fiber-tempered pottery known               from the New World. The site is also extremely rich in floral                   remains and these were systematically collected by a flotation                  technique. What also makes the site important is its location near              a savannah margin. Several archaeologists have argued that it was               in such ecotone situations that domestication of plants was most                likely to have occurred. In her research Ms. Bonzani will attempt               both to reconstruct the environment and human use of it through                 time. To accomplish the former she will study charcoal to determine             the tree species represented and also examine insect remains for                environmental clues. The latter variable will be addressed through              study of food remains themselves.                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons. It has been                     hypothesized that, based on distribution of modern wild species,                several New World crops were domesticated in northern South                     America. However direct archaeological data is lacking and Ms.                  Bonzani's research may provide relevant information. By placing the             analysis in a broader environmental context the research may also               shed light on the causes of this most basic transformation in human             subsistence. It will provide information on how humans at                       technologically simple levels adapt to changing environments and                finally contribute to the development of a promising young                      scientist.",
