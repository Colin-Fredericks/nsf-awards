The meeting                                                will provide a unique forum for                                                 presentation and disscussion of                                                 current research in device physics                                              and applications of lower                                                       dimensional semiconductor and                                                   related materials structures. This                                              includes optical and optoelectronic                                             phenomena derived from quantum                                                  confinement, fabrication of novel                                               light emitters, modulators, and                                                 detector structures based on such                                               effects and techniques as synthesis                                             and nanofabrication of small device                                             configurations.
