The project addresses both  the development, analysis, and implementation of novel numerical  methodologies, and their application to challenging problems in  fluid dynamics.  Multiple scales problems are computationally  difficult because the uniform resolution of the smallest scales  present would lead to a prohibitively large number of degrees of  freedom in the approximate solution.  They are also a  common feature of scientifically and technologically important  fluid flow phenomena.  Mathematically, they are generally  associated with singular perturbations of the governing  equations, and can be analyzed by asymptotic techniques.  The  investigator uses asymptotic analysis in a number of ways to  guide and complement the numerical computations.  Particular  problems to be studied in detail include the generation and  interaction of sound waves with concentrations of vorticity in  slightly compressible flows, the effects of complex reaction and  diffusion mechanisms on flame dynamics, and nonlinear waves in  incompressible fluids in cylindrical geometries.  Slightly  compressible flows have two distinct time scales, the fast scale  being associated with the propagation of sound waves and the slow  with incompressible flow effects.  Understanding the interaction  between the dynamics on these disparate scales is of importance,  for example, in aeroacoustics.  Numerical problems considered  include the construction of accurate radiation boundary  conditions at artificial boundaries for long time computations  and the development of efficient time-stepping procedures.  For  the combustion problems, the investigator experiments with  various high order difference methods for solving the zero Mach  number reacting flow equations.  Using adaptive methods to  capture the thin flame front, he undertakes a detailed study of   various models for the chemical kinetics and transport  coefficients.  For the simulation of cylindrical flows, he has  developed efficient Chebyshev pseudospectral methods for  differential operators in cylindrical and helical coordinates  with coordinate mappings to resolve internal critical layers for  high Reynolds numbers.  One application will be to the  long-standing problem of transition to turbulence in pipes.       The science of wave propagation has a rich history  and provides a unified approach to the analysis of diverse  physical phenomena.  Advanced numerical methods, in concert with  modern computing technology, are a powerful tool for the  comprehensive study of the dynamics of nonlinear waves.  The  computational approach runs into difficulties, however, when  disparate scales are present.  These can be time scales, where  different waves propagate at very different speeds, or spatial  scales, where certain physical quantities vary greatly in  relatively thin layers.  To fully resolve the finest scales  throughout the physical domain is far too taxing for even the  most powerful computers.  Therefore, one must develop specialized  methods, based on a careful mathematical analysis of the solution  structure.  The specific problems considered here display both  multiple time scales (sound wave - vortex interactions) and thin  layers (reaction zones in flames).  They are fundamental problems  from the physical point of view, and also provide a testbed for  new computational techniques.  ***",
