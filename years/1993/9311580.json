In particular it concentrates on three areas.  1) A theory of phase transitions in porous media with wide  distributions of pore sizes is being developed using Migdal-  Kadanoff approximations. The PI is particularly interested in  studying the 4helium superfluid transition in porous aerogel  glasses. 2) The PI proposes to study a clean example of self-  organized criticality - that of the lambda transition in 4helium in  the presence of heat flow. 3) The PI plans to study the application  of computational complexity theory (something which arose out of  theoretical computer science) to problems in statistical physics by  determining the time requirements (and therefore the algorithmic  choice) to solve various models on parallel machines.  %%%  The proposed work involves theoretical and computational approaches  to the understanding of phase transitions in disordered systems. Of  particular interest is the understanding of how helium undergoes  its superfuid transition in a porous medium - the long wavelength  fluctuations which are usually present in such transitions are  truncated by the presence of the pore cages. Another aspect of this  work concerns the study of a metastable system; that of the so-  called lambda-transition in helium in the presence of heat flow.  This produces a clean example for the study of self-organized  criticality - a concept which has been applied to phenomena as  varied as stock-market pricing and earth-quake prediction. Lastly,  the proposal attempts to classify various models for phase  transitions according ideas that came out of theoretical computer  science - ideas that concern how difficult, computationally, it is  to solve these models.  ***",
