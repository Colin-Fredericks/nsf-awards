 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program,                  will develop new methods for the synthesis of novel supra-                      molecular systems.  In particular, well-ordered and chemically                  robust surface multilayer films based on structurally charact-                  erized lamellar inorganic compounds will be synthesized.                        Layered metal phosphates and phosphonates will be synthesized                   from precursors capable of Watson-Crick base pairing and other                  multipoint cooperative hydrogen bonding interactions.                           Multilayer thin films based on Hoffmann clathrate structures                    will also be prepared and the structure, host-guest chemistry,                  electrochemistry, and optical properties of the films will be                   investigated.                                                                   %%%                                                                             This project involves the development of new techniques for                     growing complex, multilayer structures (films) based on                         lamellar inorganic compounds.  These techniques are inteneded                   to add to an emerging \"nanofabrication\" technology which                        depends upon wet-chemical methods rather than ultrahigh vacuum                  deposition.  This may ultimately lead to the successful                         preparation of molecular-scale electronic, optical, and other                   type devices.",
