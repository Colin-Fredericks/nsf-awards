 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will implement an interactive video laboratory                     based on IBM and Macintosh computers, CD-ROM and laserdisc                      players and videodisc for use in undergraduate science                          education. It focuses on increasing scientific literacy and                     sophistication among undergraduates, including significant                      numbers of non-traditional, women and minority students who are                 typically underrepresented these fields. Faculty will                           incorporate interactive video technology into teaching in the                   following areas: biology, chemistry, and physics. The equipment                 will give students, including elementary and secondary teachers                 and non-science majors who need to meet science requirements                    for certification and degree-completion, the opportunity to                     focus on critical thinking as it relates to scientific study:                   formulating and testing hypotheses; solving problems; making                    decisions. Because of the ability of the technology to                          replicate experiments which faculty could not otherwise do, the                 equipment will enable students to have a wider variety of                       laboratory experiences and multiple opportunities to                            hypothesize, test and revise than conventional laboratory                       experiments would allow. It would constitute a more \"user-                      friendly\" approach to science because it would alleviate fears                  about working in a laboratory and, particularly for future                      teachers, it would model for them active learning strategies                    and use of technology which is becoming widely available in the                 Kansas City school districts.",
