 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222073  HUTTENLOCHER    This research concerns children's ability to remember the locations  of objects.  Remembering where things are in the world has very  clear adaptive importance.  Yet, somewhat surprisingly, the well-  known work of Piaget claimed that children younger than 9 or 10  years remember location only in terms of whether something touches  or is close to a landmark, but not in terms of distance.  This  description of spatial development has guided much subsequent  thinking about curricula in areas such as geography, map-reading,  and geometry.  However, recent work using new techniques suggests  that, by as early as 16 months, children can indeed encode distance  accurately.  In addition, the small errors they do make show a  pattern of systematic bias that suggests that, like adults,  children of this age encode location in terms of spatial  categories, as well as at a more fine-grained level, combining the  two levels when they search for objects.  This process can be  called hierarchical coding.  The first group of new experiments  will test the hypothesis that children use hierarchical coding from  a very early time, by excluding several other accounts of their  bias patterns.  The second line of work will use a new paradigm to  investigate coding of distance as early as 4 months.  Infants of  this age cannot crawl, and are just beginning to reach, so finding  distance coding at this time would suggest that crawling and  reaching are not vital to such coding (as Piaget and others have  suggested).  A third set of experiments will establish the nature  of the categories used in hierarchical coding, in particular,  whether the probability and extent of subdivision of larger spaces  increases with age.  The fourth line of work will focus on biases  in spatial judgment, aimed at testing the hypothesis that these  occur when spaces are subdivided.  Taken together, the work should  establish a new theoretical account of spatial development.     ***",
