 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of dolomite from Enewetak Atoll that                       employs new fluid inclusion techniques and standard                             techniques to develop a new model for dolomitization and to                     better understand the geochemical triggers responsible for                      dolomitization.  Thorough study of Enewetak dolomite using                      traditional indirect techniques has proven less than                            adequate in constraining the model and geochemical triggers                     of dolomitization.  Alternatively, fluid inclusions provide                     a direct record of the chemical composition of ancient                          dolomitizing fluids.  Freezing techniques will be applied to                    the Enewetak fluid inclusions to determine the salinity of                      dolomitizing fluids.  Reconnaissance data indicate that the                     dolomite precipitated from a brine that was twice the                           salinity of dolomitizing fluids.  Reconnaissance data                           indicate that the dolomite precipitated from a brine that                       was twice the salinity of seawater.  Thus, a new model for                      dolomitization involving reflux of brines that have not                         precipitated evaporites is one of several hypotheses to be                      tested.  Laser Raman microprobe work will provide the first                     analyses of sulfate in an ancient fluid of low-temperature                      dolomitization.  Extracts from fluid inclusions will be                         analyzed for cations and ions by DCP and IC to further                          characterize fluids of dolomitization.  This new approach                       will provide new insight into fluid evolution and                               geochemical triggers of dolomitization.  Such information                       cannot be gleaned by standard techniques.  Lastly, the                          dolomite will be analyzed by standard carbon, oxygen, and                       strontium isotopic techniques to make the work directly                         comparable to other dolomite studies and to further evaluate                    conditions of dolomitization.",
