 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combinatorial pattern matching encompasses a large class of  problems that are now emerging in several application areas.  The most important  application areas are molecular biology  where a myriad of pattern-matching  problems occur, and test  processing in the larger context of storing,  manipulating,  searching, and information gathering from large collections  of  texts.  For example, the need for approximate pattern  matching is expected to  grow as more and more text is being  read by OCR (Optical Character Recognition)  devices which  often make errors.  This project studies  fundamental issues in combinatorial pattern matching that are   motivated by these two application areas.  Theory and practice are interleaved   in this project with practical problems motivating most of the  theoretical questions and, in at least two cases, the other way around.    The potential contributions of this work include the identification,   abstraction, and unification of important problems in this area,   and the development of algorithms and software tools for their solutions.",
