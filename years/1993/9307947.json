Support is provided by  the Chemistry Division. The objective of the research is the  development of general strategies for the synthesis of designed  layered organic solid-state materials. The approach is based on  the identification of two independent sets of functionalities  that will independently lead to the self-assembly of molecules  into a layered supramolecular network. Conceptually, the first  functionality assembles the molecules into one-dimensional  networks and the second unites the one-dimensional networks  into two-dimensional layered solids. Representative  functionality candidates are the dicarboxylic acids and  N,N'-disubstituted ureas. New persistent hydrogen bonding  motifs will be sought. The relationship between molecular  symmetry and crystallographic symmetry and the use of chirality  will be explored.  %%%  New materials with novel mechanical, electrical and optical  properties will be required by developing science and  technology. Using the tools of molecular functionality,  symmetry and chirality for control of supramolecular structure,  this research will provide critical information that will form  the basis for the design and preparation of new materials.  ***",
