 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of the proposed research is to understand               the interactions which regulate a synergistic virus infection.                  Experiments focus on synergistic interactions between potato virus              X (PVX) and any of several related viruses from the potyvirus group             of plant viruses.  The PVX/potyvirus synergisms are characterized               by a large increase in the level of PVX in co-infected cells as                 compared to cells infected with PVX only, but no corresponding                  increase or decrease in the level of the potyvirus.  Our recent                 work indicates that the regulation of PVX RNA replication is                    altered in the synergistic co-infections.  The main focus of this               proposal is to delineate the potyviral sequences which regulate                 various aspects of the PVX/potyviral synergism using stable                     transformation experiments in whole plants and in synchronously                 infected protoplasts.  A further aim is to clarify the role of long             distance viral movement in localization of the acute synergistic                response.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Recent studies have shown similarities in diverse plant and animal              viruses based on genome organization, mechanisms of gene                        expression, and sequence homology of virally encoded, nonstructural             proteins.  These results suggest that elucidation of molecular                  mechanisms for virus interactions obtained in one system may well               apply to a diverse group of other virus systems.",
