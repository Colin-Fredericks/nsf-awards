 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines contract farming arrangements in the                 Sao Francisco Valley of northeast Brazil,  It addresses the                     question of when, where, why and how fruit and vegetable firms                  seek to institute contract farming, why and how farming families                become involved in them, and the outcomes for both families                     and firms.  It tests a series of hypotheses derived from existing               literature and from a preliminary field visit, about the causes                 and consequences of contract farming.  Some of these hypotheses                 are about the logic of contract farming arrangements for firms:                 they examine the relationships between contracting and labor                    intensity of the production process, the destination of crops for               processing, and former firm experience in sharecropping.  Other                 hypotheses are about the impact of contract farming on the                      families involved.  Structured interviews with a sample of                      contract farming families and of wage-dependent families will be                used to test the hypothesis that contract farming provides higher               incomes and more stable incomes; that it decreases the range of                 income-generating auxiliary activities that family members                      perform; and that success of contract farming is correlated with                greater availability of labor resources.  In-depth interviews                   with firm managers, and with contract farming families will                     provide additional data for interpretation and cross-checking of                statistical results.",
