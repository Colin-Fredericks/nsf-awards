 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is concerned with research in algebraic geometry                and category theory.  The principal investigator will work on                   using Chow varieties to obtain desingularizations of quotient                   varieties by algebraic groups and to construct higher-dimensional               generalizations of Grothendieck-Knuidsen moduli spaces of stable                punctured curves.  He will also develop the formalism of braided                monoidal 2-categories and apply it to the study of                              Zamolodchikov's tetrahedra equations.  In addition, he will study               Koszul duality for quadratic operads as motivated by graph                      cohomology; polyhedral syzygies among Steinberg relations in                    order to get a more formal algebraic approach to higher algebraic               K-theory; and the setting for generalizing the Langlands                        correspondence to 2-dimensional schemes by using a certain                      generalization of a concept of operad.                                               This is reasearch in the field of algebraic geometry, one of               the oldestparts of modern mathematics, but one which has had a                  revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century.  In its                    origins, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by               the simplest equations, namely polynomials.  Nowadays the field                 makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in theoretical computer science and robotics.",
