 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to characterize the functions               of nucleolin, a nucleolar specific protein.  Although nucleolin is              thought to bind pre-ribosomal RNA, its actual function in                       processing nascent ribosomal RNA into 18S, 5.8S, and 28S ribosomal              RNA remains unknown.  Xenopus nucleolin consists of unique modules              with distinct functional characteristics; the amino terminal third              contains several alternating acidic and basic domains, while the                carboxyl terminal two-thirds contains four RNA-binding domains.                 Xenopus oocytes will be injected with in vitro synthesized                      transcripts that encode either epitope-tagged full length Xenopus               nucleolin or epitope-tagged nucleolin truncation peptides;                      subsequent immunolocalization of epitope-tagged nucleolin                       truncations to either the ribonucleoprotein matrices of lampbrush               chromosome loops or subregions of multiple nucleoli will strongly               indicate functional associations.  Nucleolin's macromolecular                   associations within an established Xenopus pre-rRNA processing                  extract will be determined by immunoprecipitating nucleolin-                    containing ribonucleoprotein complexes from the extract.                        Associations with other nucleolar proteins or with nucleolar-                   specific small nuclear RNAs will expand our understanding of                    nucleolin function.  Immunodepletion of nucleolin from the                      processing extract will also test the functional significance of                nucleolin in the initial pre-RRNA processing reaction.  These                   studies, which are at the interface of cellular and molecular                   biochemistry, will advance our fundamental knowledge of the                     function of the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell.                                 %%%                                                                             In eukaryotic cells, most of the genetic material is sequestered in             the nucleus of the cell, and it is in the nucleus that the DNA is               both replicated and transcribed into RNA, which in turn is                      transported out of the nucleus to function in the biosynthesis of               proteins.  Three different kinds of RNA function directly in                    protein biosynthesis in the cytoplasm:  messenger RNAs, which                   contain the \"codes\" for the specific amino acid sequences of the                nascent proteins; transfer RNAs, which are the \"decoders\" that                  supply the correct amino acids in the correct sequence; and                     ribosomal RNAs, which are structural components of the ribosomes,               the machines which \"sew\" the amino acids together.  While messenger             RNA sequences are scattered throughout the DNA of the nucleus, the              genes coding for ribosomal RNAs are grouped together in a                       microscopically-definable structural region of the nucleus called               the nucleolus.  The nucleolus contains, in addition to the                      ribosomal genes, a number of nucleolar-specific proteins which are              presumed to be involved in either transcription or assembly of                  ribosomal RNAs, but for which specific functions have not yet been              determined.  In this project, the goal is to determine the function             of one specific nucleolar protein, called nucleolin.  This work                 will advance the understanding of a fundamental process of                      eukaryotic cells.",
