 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317720    Mierson     Several functional properties of receptor cells for taste in  mammals are unknown.  Although most of our knowledge of taste  behavior, central anatomy, and nerve physiology comes from  mammalian studies, amphibian taste receptor properties are far  better known because these cells are much larger than those in  mammals, and so are more accessible to microelectrodes.  This SGER  project develops a new method for measuring the intracellular  voltages and ion concentrations in mammalian taste cells, to  explore these unknown properties.  An approach from the basal side  of the taste bud makes it possible to visually identify taste bud  cells, and to chemically and electrically manipulate the tissue  from both the basal side facing the nerves, and the apical side  facing the tastant stimuli.  Results allow testing a mathematical  model of the biophysics and mechanisms of adaptation in taste  receptors.  The technological difficulty of the new approach  presents risks, but allows testing the novel hypothesis that  sensory adaptation in mammalian taste occurs within these receptor  cells, rather than in the nerve.  The impact of this work extends  beyond taste and chemosensory neurophysiology, to the field of  epithelial physiology where the relation of intracellular to  trans-epithelial currents is important, and to computational  modeling in biology.      ***",
