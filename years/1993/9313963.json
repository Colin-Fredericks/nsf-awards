 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research on the political campaign leading up to the Spanish               election in June of 1993 is part of a large cross-national study on             the manner in which citizens obtain information during political                campaigns.  It focuses on the roles played by secondary                         organizations and personal contacts with friends, co-workers and                family as well as the impact of the mass media on the channeling                and structuring of political information to potential voters.  This             study, as part of the larger Comparative National Elections                     Project, will enhance our understanding of the flow of information              in campaigns.  The effectiveness of this communications process is              vital to citizens making informed judgements in their voting                    decisions and is, therefore, critical to the health of the                      democratic process.                                                                                                                                             The funding will be used to expand the sample size of the surveys               so that conclusions drawn on the basis of these data will be more               reliable.  The researchers will archive campaign materials,                     especially the media broadcasts that appear to play such a major                role in modern campaigns, so that the flow of information can be                accurately assessed after the campaign.  These data would not be                retrievable without immediate support for the project.",
