 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306490  Hayes    This project represents basic research into how small hormonal  and neurotransmitter molecules called peptides are used as  messengers between cells and tissues. Dr. Hayes is attempting to  discover how information is written on the structure of these  small molecules and read by the target tissues. What are the  rules of the peptide molecular language? This type of basic  information has potential for future application indirectly to  the development of  new pharmaceuticals and  to applications in  agriculture. Utilizing mosquitoes as subjects, he can  economically obtain millions of insect subjects for his  experiments. Also, by using mosquito subjects, he can direct the  results of the research toward the development of a new  generation of potential, specific insecticides that have  potential for not having harmful effects on humans, beneficial  insect, and the environment. Specifically, the project is  designed to isolate and determine the structure of peptides that  effect a physiological process critical to mosquito survival,  water and salt elimination. The structures of these naturally  occurring peptides will allow synthetic versions of the native  peptides to be prepared for the generation of antibodies and for  receptor investigations. The antibodies will be  used  to locate  sites of storage and release of the peptides within the mosquito.  This should help determine if each peptide is a neurohormone, a  neurotransmitter or an extraneuronal peptide. Synthetic analogs  of the native peptides will be designed to probe the receptor(s)  tissue location, molecular structure, and binding site surface.  The interaction between receptors and peptides are a critical and  perhaps the most important single form of intercellular  communication that integrates a collection of cells into an  organism.  ***",
