One of the processes that influences insect diet is human manipulation of the landscape. This project investigates changes in diet of the butterfly Euphydryas editha, that have been brought about by two types of human activity: cattle ranching and clear-cutting of coniferous forest. In each case, human intervention has caused insects to change their preferences for egg-laying sites and incorporate new plant species into their diets. These populations are undergoing rapid diet shifts mediated by genetic changes of host preference.  Diet expansion may be aided by correlations between maternal oviposition preference and offspring performance. This project will determine whether such correlations are present at the first arrival of the novel host. The project also continues long-term assessment of the extensive geographical variation in host specificity of E. editha. Comparisons between populations that differ in diet breadth will show whether this variation is mechanistically caused by variation among plants, among insects, or both.  %%%  Understanding patterns of plant use by herbivorous insects has been a central concern of plant-animal interactions. The PI has documented extensive temporal and spatial variation in this association of a widespread butterfly and has shown that changes in diet may be due to human influences. These diet shifts have implications for the conservation of threatened insects that live on managed land. Understanding the processes that cause herbiv ores to expand their diets will also help to elucidate the mechanisms by which non-pest insects become converted to pest status when their diets change to incorporate crop plants.         s  t            One major focus of this proposal seems to be the PI's laboratory hybridization attempts and field work to assess ecological and sexual isolation.  There is a problem, especially with sexual isolation, in that the PI has done preliminary testing with a species pair currently considered to be in different major clades and the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             0   .   3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        !         !         !         !
