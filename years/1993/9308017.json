It will focus on how authority and resistance in the  occupied territories interact in the court system.  Data will be  collected on the network of relations among the various categories  of participants (Israelis and Palestinians), and on Israeli legal  discourse about the occupation which provides the justification for  Israeli legal authority.  The study will cover three main topic  areas.  First, the investigator will conduct an ethnography of the  roles, practices and relations of the Israeli and Palestinian  participants.  Second, the investigator will analyze the  controversy over the military court system's legitimacy from the  perspectives of the participants, especially the interaction  between authority and resistance as it is negotiated in practice.   Third, the investigator will conduct a sociological analysis of  Israeli legal culture as it relates to the debate over the  applicability of international law to Israeli authority over the  occupied territories.    ***",
