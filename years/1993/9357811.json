 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates issues associated with analysis,  testing and maintenance of procedural and object-oriented  programs, with  emphasis on the problems presented by C and  C++.  Several issues of particular  concern are program  representation, integration testing, selective regression  testing and testing of object-oriented programs.  A program  representation  provides control flow, data dependence, and  control dependence information,  supporting required tools.   This representation must be efficient in terms of  both  construction time and storage space.  Algorithms that  accommodate program  modifications are sought.   Integration testing techniques make  use of the program  representation to validate interactions between procedures,  and practical regression testing techniques assist in  retesting program  after modifications.  Many of these  techniques are applicable to  object-oriented programs, but  additional techniques are being developed to test  individual  classes, selective regression testing techniques are extended  to identify the required testing in a subclass, and  both static and dynamic  analysis techniques are required  for the interaction among classes.  Finally, a prototype  system is being built to facilitate experiments, and  methods  for using the system in a distributed environment are investigated.",
