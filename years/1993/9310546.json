 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310546  Cerling   This proposal is to study the carbon isotopic composition of fossil tooth   enamel to determine the diet of mammals in the last 20 million years. C4 plants   are isotopically different from C3 plants. Therefore, this study will determine the   timing of development of C4 ecosystems, which are usually dominated by   grasses. The proposed research has three parts: 1) to identify diagenic changes   that may alter the isotopic concentration of tooth enamel, 2) to precisely   determine the time that C4 ecosystems developed on several continents, and 3)   to establish the variability of diet in horses of North America. Based on   preliminary data, the apparent synchronous development of C4 ecosystems in   the Old and New Worlds suggests a global ecological change, perhaps related   to changes in atmospheric changes in CO2. This research will establish the time   of the first significant appearance of C4-dominated ecosystems on different   continents. Specifically, fossil horses from North America, Europe, Asia, and   Africa will be studied.   %%%  This research represents the first attempt to document the development of   grassland ecosystems worldwide. Given that these C4 ecosystems developed   simultaneously on different continents, then their evolution is most likely closely   tied to global ecological change. Understanding such changes and their   consequences is vital to predicting and preparing for future changes as   atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise.  ***",
