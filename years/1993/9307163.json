Communal breeding in which adults share a  nest or mate and may provide care for unrelated young, has been  identified as one path leading to complex social systems in both  insects and vertebrates.  But even in social insects and birds,  facultative reproductive cooperation among non-relatives is rare.   To understand the origins of alternative reproductive strategies,  where individuals can breed either independently or communally, it  is essential to identify the options open to each individual and  assess the relative success of each alternative.  %%%       Both male and female Nicrophorus tomentosus (Coleoptera:   Silphidae) demonstrate facultative communal brood care.  More than  one male and/or female may help to rear young that may not be  related.  The aims of this research are to examine the frequency of  communal breeding in a natural population and to identify the  parentage of these offspring using a DNA fingerprinting technique.   %%%       This study will examine why the reproductively dominant  individuals allow communal breeding and how this might be achieved.   Several hypotheses for the evolution of sociality and of communal  breeding in particular, have been constructed with considerable  general application.  These have been tested in communally-breeding  vertebrates and in social insects with joint nest foundation.  They  can and should be tested in other groups.    %%%  The study is of practical value because the survival of the many  species committed to a Social way of life is dependent on survival  of individuals and the well-being of their social organizations.***",
