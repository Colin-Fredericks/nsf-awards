Discovering functional relationships among high-dimensional data is  astonishingly hard.  Overcoming the \"curse of dimensionality\" is a  vital problem for any complex manufacturing industry, such as VLSI  production, in which hundreds of variables must be precisely  controlled in order to achieve high-quality yield.  This research  addresses both theoretical and practical concerns.  On the  theoretical end, statisticians have recently proposed a number of  compelling new ideas for high-dimensional, nonparametric regression  (e.g., ACE, AVAS, LOESS, PPR, MARS, RPR and several other  algorithms).  These ideas are largely untested, and little is known  about their comparative performance in realistic situations.  To  remedy this, a large-scale simulation experiment is performed that  employs statistical design to evaluate the effects of sample size,  dimensionality, signal-to-noise ratio, and various kinds of  underlying functions on the integrated mean squared error of the  fitted model.  The results of the study are examined in an analysis  of variance, leading to clear conclusions as to the circumstances  under which each of the proposed methods is most valuable.  On the  practical side, this research applies the methodology studied in  the simulation experiment to VLSI production data as micro-modeled  by the PREDITOR software, which is widely used in industry to  calculate from physical principles the actual result of each step  in the production of a VLSI circuit wafer.   ***",
