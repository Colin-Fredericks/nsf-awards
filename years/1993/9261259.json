 "awd_abstract_narration": "A highly precise remote measurement system is proposed for the                  purpose of dynamically maintaining the figure of sub-millimeter-                wave radio telescope reflectors.  Such structures are normally                  distorted by the combined effects of wind forces and differential               thermal expansion.  The result of such distortions is that the                  telescopes are unable to achieve diffraction-limited angular                    resolution.  The implementation of a servo system in such                       telescopes would, at very small incremental cost, improve their                 performance (angular resolution) by as much as an order of                      magnitude.  Such a servo system needs actuators to control the                  figure, and a metrology system to generate the error signals which              drive the actuators.  This proposal is aimed at creating the                    necessary metrology system.  It should be noted that modern                     submillimeter-wave antennae (or reflector dishes) are already                   equipped with mechanical actuators, which are used to bring the                 reflector to its optimum shape following installation.  It should               be relatively straightforward matter to provide these actuators                 with electronic controls to complete the servo loop.  The proposed              technology should be applicable not only to future telescopes and               telescopes under construction, but also as a retrofit to existing               submillimeter-wave telescopes.",
