 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many features of an animal, such as its skull shape, change               throughout its life.  Yet, comparative studies of skull shape,                  including those that seek to infer evolutionary relationships among             groups, and those that examine evolutionary changes in skull form,              commonly survey only adults.  The proposed research will analyze                developmental changes in skull form to determine whether these                  transformations provide information about evolutionary                          relationships among selected rodents, and to dissect evolutionary               changes in skull development.  Recent advances in  methods for                  quantifying shape change have yielded promising techniques that                 will be applied in this analysis.  The method of thin-plate                     splines, the method that I propose to use, has a unique advantage               in that it gives a way to identify a series of independent shape                characters that have specific location and spatial extent on the                skull.  In the first stage of this project, I will compare three                genera of murid rodent Mus, Sigmodon and Peromyscus.  Relationships             among these genera are not controversial.  I will compare: 1)                   transformations in skull shape from age to age in each species; 2)              average skull shape at each age across species; and 3)                          intraspecific variability of skull shapes and their                             transformations.  This phase of the research will explore several               methodological issues, such as methods for coding developmental                 transformations of shape characters.  The second stage of the                   research will use these methods to analyze relationships among                  Sigmodon species, and to describe evolutionary modifications of                 skull growth.",
