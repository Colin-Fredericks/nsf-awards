 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352523  Crisalle  The development and implementation of a Virtual Control Lab (VCL)  for teaching the design and analysis of control systems is  conducted by this project. This educational software is supported  on personal-computer platforms and uses object-oriented programming  to produce virtual devices representing physical systems, control  instrumentation, and data acquisition and display devices. The  objective of the VCL is to give students the possibility of  exploring with alternative operational scenarios: they can  experiment with the effect of changing different control  parameters, operating the system under different regimes, and  trying out alterative control configurations. As a pedagogical tool  the VCL permits the development of practical experience using a  convincingly realistic environment. A major appeal of the VCL is  that it accomplishes teaching goals that would be difficult to  attain using physical experimental systems that often respond  slowly to actuations, and which may be expensive to operate and  maintain.  Since the entire spectrum of control applications in all  relevant engineering disciplines are essentially amenable to the  same analysis and design strategies, VCL is designed as a  multidisciplinary tool. In this project the VCL is used to teach  control technology to both chemical and electrical engineering  undergraduates. One representative system from each of these  disciplines is modeled as a virtual device; however, both systems  share the same control structures and display devices. The contents  of relevant courses will be modified to incorporate experiments  done with the VCL. Subsequently, the VCL will be used to carry out  control experiments on physical systems. ln these applications the  virtual system is deactivated, however, the controller and display  devices remain unaltered and the students can then make use of  previous experience gained from experimentation with the virtual  system.  ***",
