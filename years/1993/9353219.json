Jackson State University  Jackson, MS      \"Comprehensive Regional Center for Minorities in Mississippi\"    One of the most important goals of the nation's education system is  to produce students who are first in the World in science and  mathematics achievement by the 2000.  Recent reports indicate that  the gap between United States and other industrialized nations in  these areas is abysmally widening.  The gravity of the problem is  even more conspicuous in the case of minority students, where they  are significantly under-represented in science, mathematics and  engineering.  Minority students must be provided, from the time  each enters school, and intellectually stimulating and academically  enriched learning environment.    The Mississippi Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) Network  Alliance is a partnership among a plethora of  colleges/universities, school districts, community organizations  and other constituencies which will address the need to increase  and enhance educational opportunities for minority children and  youth in Mississippi.  The Alliance is the only organization of its  kind in the state and given the successful experiences of programs  of similar kind in the past it will be highly successful in  implementing this project.    This project has five components: (i) Pre-college Outreach (Summer  residential academies, Saturday academies and Teacher Enhancement);  (ii) Special Support Services: (iii) Family Math-Science; (iv)  Dissemination; and (v) Evaluation.  The Pre-college component  exposes and provides middle school students with challenging  approaches to science, mathematics, communication skills and  computer science learning.  Students in grades 6-8 will participate  in the residential summer academy each year.  Other activities in  the pre-college component include: role-modeling, field trips,  demonstrations by college faculty, cross-tutoring by college  students, science fairs, parental involvement, etc.  Special  Support  Services component provides family involvement and  Business/Industry/Government interface with the pre-college  component.  Linkages, additional networks and partnerships with  major agencies and stakeholders in education will be encourage to  leverage support and resources.  The teacher enhancement component  will target middle school teachers.  The primary goal is to  strengthen their content knowledge and teaching skills to enable  them to develop and implement a plan for improving math and science  instruction at their school site.  The achievements of this project  will be disseminated throughout the state and the nation.        The strength of this proposal is native to its design which has  been worked out by building from past experiences.  This project  will impact the whole state of Mississippi and may become the  vehicle for revitalizing pre-college education in science and  mathematics in the state of Mississippi.    Expected outcomes include; (i) Greater interest in careers related  to Math and Science (ii) High achievement in Math and Science  courses; (iii) Increased enrollment in Math and Science courses;  (iv) Increased enrollment in Pre-algebra; Algebra and Geometry; (v)  More schools offering Pre-algebra, Algebra and Geometry; (vi)  Increased number of teachers trained in these subjects; and (vii)  Increased time devoted to Math and Science in the classroom.",
