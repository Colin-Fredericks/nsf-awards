 "awd_abstract_narration": "9302128  Meriwether         A lidar consortium consisting of Clemson University (CU), Utah  State University (USU), the University of Maryland (UMD), and the  University of Pittsburgh (UP) jointly propose a 2-year research  program on middle atmosphere dynamics based on Doppler Rayleigh and  Raman lidar observations combined with other optical measurements  obtained at Bear Lake Observatory (BLO) and measurements of winds,  densities, and temperatures obtained from balloon and rocket  flights.  (Proposals have been submitted by three institutions  using the same text, but different budgets; UP will support this  effort through current NSF funding.)  CEDAR funding made possible  the installation in Utah of a Nd:YAG Rayleigh lidar system that had  been developed at UMD and moved to USU to be part of the BLO  facilities.  The possible altitude coverage has been extended  upward to 75 km with the addition of a 6 times more powerful  frequency-stable Nd:YAG laser that was purchased by CU for use with  the lidar Consortium system.  This upgrade of the Maryland lidar  facility also includes one additional detector channel, which is a  Raman 607 nm channel that extends profile observations of  temperature structure downward to the ground from 30 km.  The first  year of this proposed effort would continue observations of  components - a high-resolution Fabry Perot etalon and a double-axis  mirror system - that are necessary for measuring the Doppler shift  of the backscattered Rayleigh and Mie lidar spectra to observe  line-of-sight winds in the middle atmosphere.  A small radar system  will be added to observe line-of-sight winds in the middle  atmosphere.  A small radar system will be added to shut off the  laser transmitter when any aircraft is near the beam.  A new lidar  transmission channel will be added (607 nm) based on Raman-shifting  the Nd laser output in a high pressure Raman cell.  Upon completion  of these instrumental modifications at the beginning of the second  year of the grant award, a pplication of the new Doppler lidar would  collect vertical profiles of middle atmosphere winds and  temperature from clear-air portions of the atmosphere above 10 km  by using the laser returns from Mie (particulate) scattering and  Rayleigh scattering at 532 nm.  These profiles will provide the  basis for examining the occurrence, structure, interaction, and  variability of the jet stream, planetary waves, tides, and gravity  waves in the middle atmosphere above the extended mountainous  region of the American Rocky Mountain chain.  The oblique  propagation of these waves through the middle atmosphere as  filtered by the prevailing winds in the middle atmosphere will be  related to the dynamic activity simultaneously observed in the  mesopause region by several instruments at BLO.  Correlative  observations of temperature, density, and winds will be made  between the lidar and a combination of balloons and rockets.  A by-  product of the PIs observations will be the measurement of aerosol  backscatter and extinction in high clouds, particularly thin  cirrus, and the detection of stratospheric aerosols.  ***",
