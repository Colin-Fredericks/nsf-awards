 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants from high resource levels are typically fast-growers                and rapid consumers of resources, while plants from low resource                levels are slow-growers with conservative, efficient use of                     resources.  In the proposed set of studies we will be determining               the degree to which this general pattern holds for resources                    ranging from nutrients and water (below ground resources for                    plants) to light (an above ground resource).  Our experiments will              attempt to resolve some knotty questions about the general pattern              of adaptation to low and high resources:  Are the relationships                 described above caused by the environment, or is there a genetic                basis to them?  What genetic tradeoffs prevent simultaneous                     adaptation to both low and high resources?  (i.e., why shouldn't a              plant be both efficient and rapidly-growing?)  Finally, can we                  demonstrate that natural selection acts on traits relevant to                   resource use, resource acquisition and growth in natural                        environments?                                                                        The results of this research will have direct relevance to the             impacts of humans on natural plant populations because the                      environmental perturbations caused by humans often directly or                  indirectly affect resource availability.  In addition, our research             is directed toward improving the mechanistic understanding of                   natural selection in wild plant populations, thus linking plant                 physiological ecology to plant population biology, two fields which             have developed largely in isolation over the past three decades.//",
