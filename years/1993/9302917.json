 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neural networks have gained much publicity in the scientific  and popular press as a new method of computation that is  superior to standard  techniques.  Early successes with small  problem instances have generated  optimistic conjectures that  neural network solutions to computationally  difficult tasks  will scale to real-world problems.  The project focuses   on the development and application of techniques in computational complexity,   in order to bring more rigor into the study of the    scalability of neural networks to large problems.    In addition, this research focuses on quantifying both their  computational  abilities and their capacity to learn from experience.  One  objective is the formal analysis of neural networks whose  performance has  hitherto only been guessed at from  experimental evidence on small or randomly  generated  problems.  Specific subjects to be investigated include:  (1) upper  and lower bounds on the weights of linear  threshold functions, (2) the  complexity of popular Hopfield  network algorithms, (3) the complexity of the  loading  problem for analog neural networks with a fixed number of  nodes,   (4) mistake bounds for variants of the perception learning algorithm.",
