 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most recent classification of the red algae (Rhodophyta)               recognizes one class and seventeen orders, the largest being the                Gigartinales with over forty families.  For the most part, growth               takes place by means of apical cells and the plant body is                      composed of branched filaments linked by pit connections.  This                 feature makes it possible to describe vegetative and reproductive               development cell by cell, event by event using morphological and                cytological markers seen with light microscopy.  Growth is                      punctuated by discrete events and transitional stages that                      bracket each phase of development.  These include formation of :                juvenile uprights, adult thalli, reproductive organs, and                       filamentous structures employed in nutritional strategies for                   fruit development and spore production.  Characters used in                     classification are resolvable into component ontogenetic                        sequences.  Primitive and advanced character states are readily                 polarized, apparent reversals resolved, and instances of                        convergent evolution (homoplasies) identified.  Analysis shows                  that every red algal order can be defined by its basic                          developmental plan, except the polyphyletic order Gigartinales.                 This study investigates the developmental morphology of family                  clusters in the Gigartinales to complete a phylogenetic analysis                of the group.",
