 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is part of an on-going effort to improve the                       water-related courses in the Civil Engineering curriculum.                      Several strategies for improving the introductory courses so                    that issues that are relevant in terms of course content,                       delivery systems and the inclusion of state-of-the-art                          engineering design and analysis tools have been identified.                     These strategies include: a) the reorganization of the                          curriculum to provide a more effective sequencing of courses;                   b) the inclusion of new courses in the curriculum; c) the                       development of a Laboratory course in Hydrology; d) the                         addition of a Hydraulics course -- with Lab as co-requisite --                  taught within the Civil Engineering Department to replace a                     similar Fluid Mechanics course -- taught as a service course.                   This project specifcially develops the laboratory course by                     combining classical experiments and multimedia computer-based                   modules to enhance student understanding.",
