 "awd_abstract_narration": "9223333  Jones  Little attention has been paid to ways to engage students at  community colleges in the consideration of ethical and value  dimensions of scientific and engineering practice and the impacts  of science and technology.  This faculty development project has  at its core an intensive study group program for eight faculty  members from Raritan Valley Community College (RVCC) and Somerset  County Technical Institute (SCTI).  The program will enable the  faculty to integrate into the standard curriculum attention to  the ethical and value aspects of science and engineering.  To  achieve its goals and to disseminate results and provide a model  for others to consider, the program involves a collaboration  among faculty at RVCC and SCTI, the New Jersey Institute of  Technology, and high schools, industries, and other consortia  involved in advancing science and engineering education in the  region and the nation.  The project uses an across the curriculum  methodology that involves the faculty in the process of  discovering ways of modifying their standard classroom  presentations in order better to prepare students for their  careers.  The participants will meet with an expert on ethics and  science and technology who will provide advice and instruction on  approaches to ethical decisionmaking concerning science and  technology and on developing classroom environments that foster  the analytical, conceptual and social skills necessary to  encourage ethical reflection in undergraduate students in  scientific, engineering, and technical courses.  Individual core  faculty, assisted by other experts if appropriate, will conduct  weekly seminars on particular issues of science, engineering and  ethics during the Fall semester.  A day-long open workshop on  ethics and effective working relationships between industry and  academia will end the Fall semester program.  The Spring program  will recruit eight additional group members for weekly seminars  and monthly curriculum development activiti es.  At the end of  that semester, faculty, students, and members of the commuhnity  will be invited to participate in a week-long program on  \"Technology across the Curriculum,\" and a day-long program for  high school faculty will be designed to make them aware of  opportunities to consider ethics issues in science curricula.   Program activities and results will be disseminated in a wide  variety of ways.  Newsletters will keep faculty at the involved  institutions informed.  Statewide, results will be made available  through the New Jersey Institute for Collegiate Teaching and  Learning, which is a state funded project to disseminate ideas  through publications and faculty and staff development workshops.   In the state and more broadly, information will be made available  through the Statewide Systematic Initiative for Achieving  Excellence in Mathematics, Science, and Technology Education,  through the NJ Mathematics Coalition and the Academic Officers  Association of the Community Colleges, and through the  MidAtlantic Consortium for Math and Science Education.  Project  results will also be disseminated nationally at appropriate  conferences and through appropriate journals.   ***",
