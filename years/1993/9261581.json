 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project                  proposes to break the curricular gridlock which prevents little                 teaching of probability and statistics in secondary school                      mathematics courses by developing new course materials and state-               of-the-art computer software based on current understanding of                  students' conceptions of probability and statistics.  The                       computer learning environment, provisionally named                              StochasticsLab, integrates simulation, data gathering, data                     display, exploratory data analysis, and statistical inferencing                 capabilities.  Emphasis will be on illuminating the inner                       workings of statistical and probabilistic processes and promoting               investigation and exploration by allowing objects such as                       spinners, graphs, and statistical measurement tools to be linked                together by students and teachers to create dynamic micro-                      worlds.  Tightly focused yet widely applicable two-week modules                 are proposed that could be integrated into other courses in the                 high school curriculum or combined into a semester course.                      This project has educational merit and potential for widespread                 impact on education.",
