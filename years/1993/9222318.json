 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research, in the general area of theoretical                           elementary particle physics, will concentrate on aspects of                     two-dimensional quantum field theory which are important in                     the solution of mathematical problems that arise in the                         understanding of superstring theory and statistical systems.                    (Super)string theory, which is believed to provide the basic                    understanding of the fundamental forces of nature, has as its                   underlying mathematical and quantum-mechanical description the                  formalism and methods of two-dimensional quantum field theory.                  The same formalism and methods are used in the study of                         certain one- and two-dimensional statistical mechanics models                   which describe the behavior of diverse systems such as long-                    chain molecules and membranes, and may explain certain                          phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity.  In both                  cases it has become apparent that much progress can be made in                  those situations where one is dealing with \"integrable\"                         systems, because in such situations a complete solution of the                  corresponding mathematical problems can be obtained.  It is                     believe that the relevant integrable systems can be described                   in two complementary, but equivalent, manners, either as so-                    called Liouville and Toda theories, or as nonlocal induced                      gravity and W-gravity theories.  The research will focus on                     the study of such theories and is expected to provide                           important information concerning strings and the explanation                    of the fundamental forces of nature, as well as information                     about statistical systems which arise in many practical                         applications.",
