These devices were                                                     fabricated by depositing a                                                      transparent n-type                                                              semiconductor (indium-                                                          tinoxide) on the porous                                                         surface of electrochemically                                                    etched p-type Si wafers. The                                                    key to the visible emission is                                                  believed to be the quantum                                                      confinement phenomenon in the                                                   nanometer-sized Si                                                              crystallites in the porous Si                                                   layers. As crystallites get                                                     smaller, the emission spectrum                                                  shifts to shorter wavelengths                                                   (blue shift). However,  we                                                      have noted that Si                                                              crystallites with light                                                         emission below yellow                                                           wavelengths are physically too                                                  fragile and  susceptible to                                                     environmental effects and thus                                                  are not suitable for device                                                     fabrication.                                                                    We propose a unique solution                                                    to the above problem; since                                                     crystalline carbon (diamond)                                                    has a large band  gap of 5.47                                                   eV, alloys of only a few                                                        percent C in Si will readily                                                    increase the base band gap of                                                   the new material  into the                                                      range where quantum structures                                                  of stable dimensionality can                                                    be prepared. We shall use non-                                                  equilibrium deposition                                                          conditions to assure epitaxial                                                  growth of Si 1-x Cx alloys                                                      without the formation of SiC                                                    phase.                                                                          In Phase I, we will use the                                                     chemical vapor deposition                                                       (CVD) process to grow                                                           epitaxial Si 1-x Cx layers  on                                                  Si substrates at low                                                            temperatures. These layers                                                      will then be electrochemically                                                  etched to produce porous                                                        layers capable of light                                                         emission in the blue                                                            wavelength range. The material                                                  and structural quality of the                                                   epitaxial and porous layers                                                     will be evaluated using                                                         various characterization                                                        techniques. The blue                                                            photoluminescence in porous Si                                                  1-x Cx layers will be                                                           demonstrated. We will                                                           fabricate high efficiency Si-                                                   based  blue LEDs in Phase II.",
