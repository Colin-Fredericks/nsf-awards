 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310916  Hare    Perhaps the most important advance in archaeology over the past  40 years has been the development of absolute dating techniques,  beginning with Carbon-14, which allows for the dating of  materials back as far as 30,000 years, and continuing on with  Potassium/Argon techniques for much more ancient materials.   However, no such dating technique was available that covered the  period of our prehistory between 30,000 and 300,000 years ago.    Recently, this group of scientists has developed an important  and reliable dating technique that covers a good deal of this  interval, by using eggshell, especially ostrich eggshell, but now  likely generalizable to new materials:  fish earbones, the  \"doors\" of gastropods, and so on.  They will pursue these  applications in this project, as well as expanding the technique  to more recent time intervals, and refining it.    This project will expand our understanding of the origins of  moderns humans, currently a very contentious subject.  ***",
