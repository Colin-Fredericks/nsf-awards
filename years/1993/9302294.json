 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research project, an innovative methodology is developed                for analysis, design and simulation of high-order complex                       nonlinear dynamic systems having an underlying multiple time-                   scale structure. A general approach is formulated for time-scale                identification, efficient numerical simulation, and reduced-                    order model development for high-order nonlinear systems                        encountered in the context of designing machines, processes,                    structures, vehicles and robotic manipulators. The methodology is               based upon the use of Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP)                 technique, which is an iterative decoupling procedure originally                developed for singularly perturbed linear systems. The                          application of this methodology has been successfully                           demonstrated for stiff problems in chemical kinetics. In this                   research, both initial and boundary value problems are addressed.               Formulating system design problems in the framework of optimal                  control leads to Hamiltonian boundary-value problems which often                have multiple time-scale structures. The modified and extended                  CSP method is used as a user friendly software-oriented general                 tool for such problems, and provides a significantly new                        capability for complex nonlinear system analysis and design.***  //",
