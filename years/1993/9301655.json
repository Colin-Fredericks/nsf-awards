 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is determination of chemical kinetic data              for reactions of metals involved in toxic emissions associated with             incineration of waste materials.  Reactions of nickel, lead,                    cadmium, chromium, and antimony, with HCl, O2, CO2, and Cl2 as                  oxidants, will be studied; atomic metals as well as metal oxides                and halides will be included in this investigation.  A uniyue set               of facilities (high-temperature fast-flow and pseudo-static metals              high-temperature photochemistry reactors) will be used to provide               rate coefficient and mechanistic data on individual isolated                    reactions over a 300-1800K temperature range at pressures from 0.01             to 1.0 atmospheres.  Laser-induced fluorescence and other optical               and mass spectroscopic techniques will be employed for rate                     coefficient and product identification measurements.  Information               obtained from the experiments will be used to aid in estimation of              kinetics for reactions of metal species other than those addressed              in the experiments.  This work is a logical continuation/extension              of current studies being conducted by the PI under NSF and Air                  Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) funding.                                                                                                            The presence of many metallic species in municipal, hazardous, and              biomedical waste incinerators can lead to emissions of toxic                    gaseous molecules and fly ash, as well as production of toxic                   components in bottom ash and slag.  The combustion process                      influences the distribution of the metals among these various                   \"products\" and their particle size and oxidation state, as well as              the ease of leaching of the residual solids.  This work is also                 relevant to combustion processes used to decontaminate soils, since             these can lead to similar gaseous and particle emissions, and to                emissions from high-temperature industrial devices such as glass                smelters, calciners, aluminum furnaces, and lead smelters.",
