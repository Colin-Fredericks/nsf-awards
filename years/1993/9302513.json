 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the interaction between studies of                 partial differential equations and the theory of several complex                variables.  The history of these interactions has been long and                 fruitful, with each subject providing valuable information to the               other. The present work builds on a recent formulation of a                     unique continuation property for the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann               equations in several variables that will yield information about                boundary behavior of holomorphic mappings between domains in                    complex space.  Efforts will be made to verify the property in                  the most important categories of domains.  Work will also be done               using recent results about the regularity of the Cauchy-Riemann                 equations combined with geometric arguments to prove regularity                 theorems for the Bergman projection.  Such results also have                    applications to mappings problems in several complex variables. A               program to express the classical solutions to the Dirichlet and                 Neumann problems for the laplace operator on domains in the plane               in terms of the Szego projection and kernel has just been                       completed.  These results give rise to new and practical methods                for numerically computing solutions to classical problems in                    partial differential equations and conformal mapping which are of               interest in the applied sciences.  Work will continue exploring                 applications of the Szego projection to related problems.                       Students on the project will be used to test the efficiency of                  the resulting numerical methods.                                                     The theory of several complex variables plays a central role               in the analysis of linear partial differential equations.  It                   provides an excellent environment in which tools from geometry,                 analysis and functional analysis can be brought to bear on                      equations which relate to modeling of the physical world.",
