 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311055  Stachel  Professor Stachel is undertaking a major study of the history of  relativity, including histories of the special and general theories  of relativity as well as a history of unified field theories.   Under this grant, Professor Stachel is preparing  a history of the  special theory of relativity and the general theory up to the death  of Einstein in 1955.  These studies include an examination of the  19th century antecedents of both theories, an explanation of how  Albert Einstein came to formulate them, how they were accepted by  the scientific community, and the later development of both  theories, their observational and experimental testing, and  applications to other branches of physics and to technology.      The special theory has had its main influence on elementary  particle physics, while the general theory, as the relativistic  theory of gravitation, has been most influential in celestial  mechanics and astrophysics.  Included in this study is an  examination of how each theory in turn evolved from a controversial  doctrine into an everyday tool of the working physicist in these  fields.  Although the subject matter inherently involves many  abstract concepts and much mathematics, Professor Stachel is  attempting to offer physically intuitive explanations and  illustrations wherever possible.  He is also discussing the popular  reception and philosophical impact of relativity.   These studies  should be of great interest to physicists, historians and  philosophers of science and members of the general public  with a  serious interest in relativity.  ***",
