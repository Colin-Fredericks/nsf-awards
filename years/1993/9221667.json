 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221667  Schwartz    Dr. Schwartz is just beginning to learn about molecular  mechanisms by which growth hormone (GH), a major regulator of  normal growth, exerts its varied biological effects. It is now  clear that GH regulates the expression of several genes. During  the previous granting period, this laboratory established  that  GH rapidly stimulates two proto-oncogenes (growth-related genes)  c-fos and c-jun in 3T3-F442A cells. The products of these genes  play a key role in the regulatory region of  the c-fos with  differentiation of these cells to fat cells. Her recent studies  of the c-fos gene have been very exciting in that they enabled  her to identify two regulatory regions which appear to be  sensitive to GH: the serum response element (SRE) and the SIF  element. Analysis of these regulatory regions provide an  essential key to understanding the earliest events in the  mechanism of GH action. She is thus in an excellent position to  make substantial progress in this direction, since c-fos is one  of the best characterized genes and the regulation of c-fos is an  area of active investigation. Importantly, regulatory factors  which bind to both the SRE and the SIF element have been  identified. Here, using c-fos as a model to understand mechanisms  by which expression are modulated by GH. Analysis of these  regulatory factors in turn directs this project to signaling  mechanisms. Analysis of effects of GH on the multiple factors  which regulate c-fos will provide fundamental new information  regarding mechanisms by which GH regulates genes and on the  signaling pathways involved.  ***",
