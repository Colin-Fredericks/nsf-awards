 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hormone-stimulated hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol bis-                     phosphate is followed by conversion of phosphatidyl inositol to                 phosphatidyl inositol bis-phosphate.  Studies indicate that lipid               from subcellular organelles in addition to the plasma membrane must             be accessible in order to account for the large amount of PtdIns                that is often involved in the cycling response.  To date, two                   mechanisms have been proposed to explain this:  (1) A PtdIns                    transfer protein facilitates the transfer of intracellular PtdIns               to the plasma membrane, and (2) The bulk of the PtdIns metabolized              is hydrolyzed directly, perhaps as a result of the rise in                      intracellular free calcium, and is not involved in the generation               of inositol tris phosphate second messengers or directly associated             with a hormone-receptor complex.  A third possibility is suggested:             (3) Internal membrane PtdIns is accessed as a result of receptor                sequestration and recycling through the interior of the cell.  A                series of experiments have been devised to test this third                      possibility.  They involve inhibition of internalization by                     potassium depletion as well as by receptor mutation.  As a                      corollary to this hypothesis, compensatory resynthesis of PtdIns                need not take place at the plasma membrane.  The subcellular                    location of the PtdIns synthetase enzyme will be determined by                  immunocytochemistry.                                                            %%%                                                                             One important signaling pathway in the response of cells to                     hormones involves the breakdown of a membrane component known as                phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate to produce further signal                    molecules.  To maintain a cell's ability to respond to hormone,                 this material must be resynthesized.  The goal of this research is              to determine where within the cell resynthesis takes place and how              it is controlled in coordination with hormonal stimulation of the               cell.  The results of this research will contribute important new               information on how cells respond to hormones and other external                 signals.",
