 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Dr. Maria Masucci will                 conduct neutron activation analysis of clay samples collected in                the southwestern portion of Ecuador. She will also conduct                      neutron activation as well as petrographic analysis on a series                 of ceramics which date from Guangala Phase (100B.C.-A.D.800)                    sites located in the same region. These studies will shed light                 on details of the ceramic manufacturing process and also allow                  the clay in finished vessels to be traced back to raw material                  source areas. This information in turn will permit Dr. Masucci to               reconstruct the economic and political interactions among                       individual Guangala Phase communities and determine how they                    changed over time.                                                                                                                                              The Andean region was home to one of the world's great                          civilizations which saw the incorporation of large numbers of                   individuals into a state comparable in size to those which exist                in the region today. Centralized authorities commanded enough                   labor to erect monumental constructions and maintain an extensive               road system. Archaeologists wish to understand the processes                    which lead to the rise of complex societies and many believe that               trade, and relative inequities which developed through it may                   have played an important part. While much is known about the                    prehistory of Peru, relatively less information is available for                Ecuador, its northern neighbor, and as the political situation in               Peru has grown more difficult, archaeologists have focussed their               attention more in other Andean regions. The Guangala Phase                      appears to mark a period of incipient political centralization                  and therefore the results of Dr. Masucci's work should shed light               on the state development process.                                                                                                                               This project will produce data of interest to a large number of                 archaeologists. It will also help to develop analytic techniques                which may be applied in many archaeological situations.",
