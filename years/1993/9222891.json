 "awd_abstract_narration": "9222891  Balsam    The aim of this research project is to develop a model system for the analysis of  the role of learning in behavioral development.  During development, experience  can affect all of the factors that control the expression of behavior as well as the  form of the response itself.  For example, in many species the factors that guide  feeding behavior change during development.  Many young animals eat under very  different circumstances than do the adults of that species.  Additionally, in many  species the form of the feeding response changes, as when young mammals go  from suckling to independent feeding.  In both of kinds of changes, experience  plays an important role.    Drs. Balsam and Deich are attempting to understand changes that occur over the  course of development by using principles of learning and memory to analyze  specific developmental transitions.  The model system in which they study these  processes is in the transition from dependent to independent feeding in ring doves.   Both the transitions in controls of feeding and changes in the form of feeding  responses will be described and the processes underlying the transitions will be  analyzed.  In addition to clarifying the role of learning in development, these  studies will contribute to a general methodology and theory for the study of the  induction and maintenance of new response forms.",
