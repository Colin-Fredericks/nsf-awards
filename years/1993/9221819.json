 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research in the areas of                  partial differential equations and functional differential                      equations. The work focuses on the applications of infinite                     dimensional nonlinear programming theory to optimal control                     problems for systems governed by equations such as the                          Navier-Stokes equations, reaction-diffusion equations and                       nonlinear wave equations.  The object is to obtain existence                    results in the realm of relaxed controls, necessary conditions                  for optimal controls of the type of Pontryagin's maximum                        principle, convergence results for numerically obtained sequences               of suboptimal controls and feedback solutions by means of                       Hamilton-Jacoby equations.  Work will be done both in the case of               distributed and boundary control for problems that include sate                 constraints.  Regularization of problems containing singular arcs               and the role of the Hamiltonian in free arrival time problems                   will also be examined.                                                               Partial differential equations form a basis for mathematical               modeling of the physical world.  The role of mathematical                       analysis is not so much to create the equations as it is to                     provide qualitative and quantitative information about the                      solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                         uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis often                 develops methods for approximation of solutions and estimates on                the accuracy of these approximations.",
