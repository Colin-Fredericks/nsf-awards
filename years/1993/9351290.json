 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for purchase of an X-ray fluorescence                      analyzer (XRF), the Kevex EDX-771, to enhance our capabilities                  in quantification of environmental data in undergraduate                        courses and undergraduate research in the fields of                             Environmental Sciences, Geological Sciences, Biology, and                       Chemistry. The recent establishment of an Environmental                         Sciences concentration (major) at Brown builds on the expertise                 of faculty in these natural sciences and the established                        policy-oriented Center for Environmental Studies. Joint use of                  the XRF would encourage development of interdepartmental ties                   while strengthening the new Environmental Science program.New                   environmental courses are being offered and existing courses                    are evolving to a stronger field-analytical orientation. Access                 to the XRF would give students in these courses the opportunity                 to perform chemical analyses in lab exercises simulating                        natural processes, to analyze natural materials, and to                         determine how limitations of the instrument constrain our                       ability to solve certain problems. A senior thesis is required                  of all Environmental Science and GeoScience majors and most                     science concentrators choose at least one semester of                           independent research. Many of these research projects will make                 excellent use of an XRF analytical facility.",
