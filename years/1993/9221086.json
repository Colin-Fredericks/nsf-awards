 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research project is to understand the regulatory               mechanisms mediating metabolic repression of photosynthetic genes               in higher plants.  Recent studies in this laboratory have shown                 that sugars and acetate specifically and coordinately repress seven             maize photosynthetic gene promoters.  The repression is effective               at physiological concentrations of these metabolites, and overrides             regulation by light, cell type, and developmental stage.  Metabolic             repression of transcription appears to be a major regulatory                    circuit in maize and is susceptible to biochemical and molecular                genetic analyses using protoplast transient expression methods                  established in this laboratory.                                                                                                                                 The project can be divided into two parts: the first part is to                 continue the study of transcriptional mechanisms directly involved              in glucose- and acetate-mediated photosynthetic gene repression.                Using a well characterized maize photosynthetic gene promoter (the              cabZm5 promoter) fused to an assayable reporter gene, the                       investigator will begin to define the cis-acting regulatory DNA                 elements mediating metabolic repression.  The investigator will                 also characterize the changes in DNA-protein interactions which                 follow and/or mediate repression.  The second part aims to                      understand how the glucose concentration is sensed and transduced.              Various glucose analogues, chemical inhibitors, and maize                       hexokinase mutants will be used to determine whether glucose                    phosphorylation or metabolism is required for repression.  Because              preliminary results suggest cAMP can be a relevant second messenger             in the maize system (as in yeast and vertebrates), the effects of               agents impacting cAMP or cAMP-dependent protein kinases will be                 investigated.  Finally, to test regulatory concepts generated by                work using protoplast transient expression assays, the investigator             will begin to create a transgenic maize system and analyze                      transgenic maize plants.  The results from this project will                    provide much needed insight into metabolite-mediated signal                     transduction and gene regulation essential to plant growth and                  development.",
