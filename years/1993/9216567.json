 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will study three dimensional                         excitable media, both in terms of chemical reactions but                        also are related to the electrophysiology of the heart.  The                    key ideas of the project are 1)  the normal heart muscle is                     an excitable medium; 2) some aspects of the dynamics of                         excitable media are generic, notably their vortex                               excitations; 3) these aspects are inherently 3-dimensional;                     4) in heart muscle these vortex excitations are responsible                     for the most pernicious arrhythmias, but are almost                             impossible to study 3-dimensionally in living heart muscle;                     5) they can be studied computationally and in chemically                        excitable media, both of which support action-potential-like                    propagation in three dimensions; 6) the utility of this                         comparison has been validated in two dimensional studies; 7)                    the pure computation for equations of mechanism should be                       complemented by experiments; 8) such experiments can be                         implemented by adapting existing computational procedures in                    optical tomography to existing computational procedures for                     analysis and display of the data that are currently obtained                    by supercomputer solution of the mechanistic equations of                       cardiac electrophysiology and of the analogous chemical                         kinetics.  The investigator will solve the \"three-                              dimensional\" for the mechanisms and use computer-assisted                       optical tomography to observe three dimensional activation                      wavefronts in the chemical medium during the analog to these                    arrhythmias.  The current project is being supported by four                    programs at the National Science Foundation:  Theoretical                       and Computational Chemistry, Applied & Computational                            Mathematics, Physiology, and Computational Biology                              Activities.",
