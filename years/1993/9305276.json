 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a supercontinent, named \"Gondwana, \"has stirred             the imaginations and stimulated the research of geoscientists since             the first suggestion of the possibility of continental drift.  The              Mesozoic-Cenozoic fragmentation of Gondwana is now reasonably well              understood, but the original of the supercontinent is still largely             a matter of speculation.  Because Gondwana constituted                          approximately one half of the world's continental crust, the                    history of assembly of Gondwana is a large part of the history of               assembly of \"Pangea\" near the end of the Paleozoic.  Furthermore,               the age and sequence of accretion of fragments to Gondwana place                important constraints on efforts to decipher the configuration and              history of fragmentation of a middle-to-late-Proterozoic                        supercontinent (\"Rodinia\").                                                                                                                                          The principal investigators wish to study the assembly of                  Gondwana by organizing coordinated research projects that                       investigate geographic areas and use techniques that are regarded               as particularly useful.  As a start, they will hold a workshop to               identify problems that are both  important and require a                        coordinated approach.  They have assembled an international group               of scientists with expertise in various geographic areas and                    geoscience disciplines and will bring them together in the spring               of 1993.  The primary purpose of this workshop will be to prepare               a proposal for further coordinated research projects.",
