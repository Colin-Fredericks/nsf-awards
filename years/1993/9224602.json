This research is carried out in collaboration with Bruce Shapiro,  National Institutes of Health. Scientific progress often results  from discovering structural commonalities that explain similar  behavior.  For example, in molecular biology, a set of proteins or  DNA sequences may express similar functionality in nature.  This  project aims to help scientists discover common sequence or  topological patterns that explain the similarity.  Pattern  discovery entails generating pattern guesses in a systematic way  and testing them.  The tests are based on approximate pattern  matching algorithms that yield distance metrics.  Thus,  commonalities may be approximate.  The main research milestones are  a family of algorithms for pattern discovery, query processing,  data organization and index manipulation.  The algorithms are to be  tested on data drawn from the National Institutes of Health and  from public genome databases.  Whereas some of the algorithms are  specific to the combinatorial structures present in biology, many  of the techniques should generalize to any application that seeks  to find patterns in databases.  This project will help scientists  discover patterns in large databases that determine natural  behavior.  Such patterns may lead to new drug design or to new  treatments.   ***",
