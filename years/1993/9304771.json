 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although women have been playing increasingly important                    roles in the restructuring of the contemporary American economy,                relatively little research in geography or other fields has                     focused on the impact of individual decision making by women                    trying to reconcile responsibilities both at work and at home on                their patterns of employment.  This doctoral dissertation                       research project will examine the role that acquisition of                      domestic services has on the women who provide such services as                 well as on women in the middle- and upper-income households that                employ domestic servants.  Primary quantitative and qualitative                 data will be gathered through surveys and interviews with                       domestic workers and employers of domestic workers in three                     different neighborhoods in the San Diego metropolitan area.                     Longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of these data will be                 undertaken using a range of statistical procedures.                                  This project will provide valuable new insights into the                   dynamics of employment and locational decision making among two                 groups of women -- professional women who have entered labor                    markets in increasing numbers in recent decades, and domestic                   servants, most of whom are recent immigrants from developing                    nations whose migration to the U.S. was spurred by other                        dimensions of global economic change.  This project will                        contribute to understandings of the interplay between paid                      employment and domestic responsibilities, the role of women's                   paid and unpaid work in local labor-market dynamics, and the role               of gender in international migration and the operation of                       immigrant labor markets.  As a doctoral dissertation improvement                award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising               student to establish a strong independent research career.",
