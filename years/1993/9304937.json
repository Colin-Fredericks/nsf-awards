 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304937  Livingston  The yeast RAD52 gene plays a central role in chromosome  maintenance.  Its importance is illustrated by the severe defects  mutant cells have in repairing damaged DNA, recombining  chromosomes, and in completing melotic division.  The role of the  protein product has not been defined.  This project is examining  the genetics of RAD52.  The study begins with the characterization  of temperature-sensitive alleles, which we have isolated, having  defects in either DNA repair or chromosome recombination.  These  mutants are then used to find extragenic suppressors.  Such  suppressors will identify other genes whose products interact with  Rad52p, the protein product of RAD52.  The temperature-sensitive  alleles, as well as a truncation allele which is able to sporulate,  are next used to study the role of Rad52p in meiosis. Molecular  studies include an examination of protein-protein interactions:  between Rad52p polypeptide selected through a fusion library of  yeast proteins.  Another molecular study includes the examination  of the extent with which the temperature-sensitive and other  recombination-proficient RAD52 mutants resect double strand breaks  in vivo.  %%%  This research is concerned with two processes important to all  organisms: genetic recombination and repair of DNA.  ***",
