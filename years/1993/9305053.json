 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305053   Moyer       The State System of Higher Education (SSHE) of Pennsylvania  on behalf of its member institutions, proposes to connect the 14  System Universities (at 22 sites) to the Pennsylvania Research  and Economic Partnership Network (PREPnet).  Since it is not  economically feasible to individually connect each site to  PREPnet, the sites must first be connected as a single entity to  gateway to PREPnet.  PREPnet will in turn provide access to  NSFNET, the Internet, and other national networks. The  educational institutions that will participate include:  Bloomsburg University, California University of Pennsylvania,  Cheyney Univ., Clarion Univ., East Stroudsburg Univ. Edinboro  Univ., Indiana Univ. of Pennsylvania, Kutztown Univ., Loch Haven  Univ., Mansfield Univ., Millersville Univ., Shippensburg Univ.,  Slippery Rock Univ., and West Chester Univ..        The network will provide a consistent statewide architecture  for NSFNET access for a broad variety of entities engaged in  education and research.  This cooperative network will provide  gateways to regional, national, and international networks and  will be consistent with their standards.  It will further the  institutions' work in enhancing the state's economic development  through a well-educated workforce, accessible training  opportunities, and research and development partnerships.   Another goal of the network is to facilitate collaborative  projects and sharing of resources between institutions, including  those outside the state.       The universities need greater functionality and network  speed to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make  file transfers along with being able to implement a more reliable  mail system. Students and faculty research will benefit from the  link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the schools to  explore innovative educational resources.  ***",
