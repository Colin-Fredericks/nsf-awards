 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ash  9307242       This mathematical research focuses on problems of multiple  trigonometric series.  The single-variable theory of such series  could be said to be reasonably well understood, although there  remain a number of exceedingly difficult problems still  unresolved.  Multiple trigonometric series have intrinsic  problems which do not allow for simple generalizations from the  one-variable case.  One of the primary issues of convergence  results from the variety of natural ways one can try to sum a  multiple series.  Even the most basic question of whether  a multiple series which sums to the zero function must have  zero coefficients (Cantor's theorem in one variable).  If  unrestricted rectangular convergence is allowed then the answer  is affirmative in all dimensions.  This was only proved two years  ago.  For spherical and square convergence, the answer is still  unknown, except for spherical in dimension two.  Work will be  done to extend the recent results obtained for rectangular  convergence to the remaining cases. Related work will be carried  out on the almost everywhere convergence of multiple Fourier  series.  For functions in the Lebesgue spaces with power less  than two, spherical partial sums may diverge on sets of positive  measure.  Nothing is known about convergence for functions with  finite quadratic norm (Hilbert space).  To study this class, work  will first concentrate on radial functions to see if  counterexamples already exist within this group.       The influence of trigonometric series on the development  of modern mathematical analysis is impossible to record in  this short space.  The basic U.S. graduate courses are replete  with byproducts of the research efforts that have gone into  our attempts to understand these building blocks of  mathematical synthesis used universally by all scientists.  Yet  the underlying summability properties of the series remains, to a  large extent, an enigma.  This project seeks to build on a  remarkable breakthrough which  occurred when four researchers  settled one of the most famous unsolved problems of multiple  Fourier series two years ago.  ***",
