 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to use individual ship                    reports from the COADS Compressed Marine Reports 5 to produce a                 global, high resolution data base for observational and modeling                studies of the atmosphere-ocean system.  In addition to basic                   quantities such as wind, sea surface temperature and humidity, this             data set will include estimates of surface wind stress, latent and              sensible heat fluxes, and short and long wave radiation fluxes.                 Particular attention will be paid to correct known biases                       associated with erroneous Beaufort scale and adjustment of the                  anemometer height to a standard 10 m reference level.                                The data sets will be produced in two different resolutions:               1) Global monthly mean summaries with 10 longitude by 10 latitude               resolution, anomalies and climatology from 1945 to 1989;  and 2)                Global weekly mean summaries with 0.50 longitude by 0.50 latitude               resolution, climatology form 1965 to 1989.  These summaries will                then be globally analyzed by essentially the same objective                     analysis scheme used in Levitus' Climatological Atlas of the World              Oceans (1982).  Raw monthly/weekly statistics will be made                      available to those users desiring to perform their own objective                analysis.                                                                            All products will be made widely available to the national and             international scientific and operational communities with no                    restrictions.                                                                        This project will provide better and more valuable data                    products for the use of the scientific community for observational              studies of atmosphere-ocean system as well as forcing of the                    oceanic general circulation models, for air-sea interaction studies             from interannual to decadal time scales, both in the tropics and/or             extratropics and provide a more accurate surface marine climatology             than presently exists.",
