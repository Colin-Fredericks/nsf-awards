 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large, complex software applications are pushing the                            performance limitations of today's engineering workstations.                    Such applications frequently require virtual memory greatly in                  excess of available physical memory, and performance becomes                    dominated by paging time.  Paging performance is ultimately                     dependent on the speed of disk I/O, which runs orders of                        magnitude slower than the maximum performance possible with                     physical memory and CPU speed alone.  Paging performance is                     directly related to the number of different pages the                           application touches (i.e., read or writes) per unit time.  The                  inverse of this measure can be thought of as a measure of                       \"locality of reference.\"  When the number of pages touched per                  unit time significantly exceeds the amount of free physical                     memory, performance begins to degrade, sometimes dramatically.                                                                                                  This research aims to provide a mechanism for increasing                        locality of reference in an existing Common Lisp system by                      clustering objects in virtual memory with the goal of                           significantly decreasing the number of pages touched per unit                   time.  Specifically, the work is in two areas: (1) prototyping                  tools for reporting useful information on paging and locality                   of reference, and (2) to investigating methods for                              automatically increasing locality of reference during                           application execution.",
