 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project employs tools of Biophysics to answer fundamental                  questions about the structure and function of the gated membrane                channel,  VDAC or mitochondrial porin, which is formed by a 31-kD               protein in the mitochondrial outer membrane.  The main technique                used is high-resolution electron microscopy and computer-based                  image analysis.  The channel spontaneously forms planar crystalline             arrays when the outer mitochondrial membrane of the fungus                      Neurospora crassa is treated with phospholipase A2.  The image                  processing technique of correlation averaging is used to obtain                 projection images with resolution approaching 10 angstroms from                 these two-dimensional crystals embedded in either vitreous ice or               the sugar, aurothioglucose.  Three-dimensional structures are                   obtained by combining projection data from variously tilted                     crystals.  The phospholipase-induced crystals are polymorphic, i.e.             there are several types, and the occurrence of certain types                    correlates with exposure to effectors of the channel's gating                   properties.  Thus, it is hoped that comparison of the channel                   structures in the different crystal polymorphs will shed light on               the conformational changes underlying gating.  In order to overcome             the 10 angstrom resolution limit, needed to directly visualize                  protein secondary structure, attempts to reconstitute the channel               protein into larger, better ordered two-dimensional crystal are to              be undertaken.  Also, three-dimensional crysal trails will be                   initiated using protein overexpressed in bacteria.  If successful,              this will open the way for x-ray crystallographic studies.  In the              meantime, complementary information about the folding of the                    channel polypeptide will be provided by circular dichroism studies              and by immunolabelling of the crystals with Fab fragments of                    sequence-specific, anti-peptide antibodies.                                     %%%                                                                             The cell and its internal compartments are bounded by membranes                 composed of lipids and proteins.  The lipids form a bilayer sheath              that is impenetrable to polar ions and molecules.  Proteins make it             possible for the different compartments to communicate, i.e.,                   exchange material.  For example, some proteins form channels,                   water-filled passageways across the membrane bilayer which open and             close (or gate) in response to different stimuli.  The basis                    structure of channels and the molecular mechanism(s) of their                   gating are only poorly understood.  In this project, we are                     studying a channel that occurs on the surface of the intracellular              organelle that is the cell's powerplant, the mitochondrion.  This               channel is switched by transmembrane electrical potentials between              states with different degrees of openness, and this gating appears              to be controlled by other proteins in the mitochondrion.  Using                 electron crystallography and other biophysical and biochemical                  approaches, we are determining the three-dimensional structure of               the channel in different states, in order to understand how it is               formed how it opens and closes.",
