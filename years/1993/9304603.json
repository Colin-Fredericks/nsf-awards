 "awd_abstract_narration": "A detailed view of cytoarchitecture is essential to understanding             kinetics and mechanisms of biochemical reactions in living cells,               and for understanding transport and localization of intracellular               components.  Rheological, biochemical, and electron microscopic                 evidence suggests that cytoskeletal elements interact to form a                 three-dimensional cytoplasmic network.  Measurements of solvent                 viscosity in living cells indicate that rotational diffusion of                 molecules in cytoplasm is essentially the same as in dilute                     solution, while their translational diffusion is significantly                  hindered, apparently by a combination of collisions with other                  solute molecules and sieving by the cytoskeletal network.  Even                 very small solutes such as ions and metabolites may diffuse 3 to 4              times slower in cytoplasm than in dilute aqueous solution.  The                 diffusion of particles >26 nm in diameter is further constrained by             exclusion from some subcompartments.  Many of the intracellular                 components involved in protein synthesis, respiration and particle              transport are also absent from such compartments, raising the                   possibility that they represent functional as well as structural                differentiations of the cytoplasm.  Excluding compartments are                  filled with bundles and meshworks of actin microfilaments. An                   actin-binding protein, ABP280, that crosslinks F-actin into                     isotropic networks is also concentrated in excluding compartments.              Since F-actin / ABP280 networks in vitro are very elastic and                   stable, the presence of these two cytoskeletal proteins in                      excluding compartments suggests they are specialized for a                      mechanical function.  The objectives of this proposal are to test               several models for the organization of the cytoskeletal network                 that hinders the diffusion of macromolecules, to test the                       hypothesis that exclusion of large particles from excluding                     compartments is due to molecular sieving by a gel network, to                   identify actin-binding proteins that may be components of the                   cytoarchitecture of excluding compartments, and to attempt to                   implicate F-actin and ABP280 more directly in the exclusion of                  particles by selectively disrupting their function.  A                          multidisciplinary approach will be employed, combining                          microinjection of proteins and inert fluorescent tracer particles               into living cells, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to                measure intracellular diffusion coefficients, digital fluorescence              microscopy to study the dynamic localization of injected molecules              and the response of the cells to them, fluorescent antibody                     localization of endogenous molecules in cells that have been fixed,             gold antibody localization to obtain a high resolution picture of               the three-dimensional organization of molecules in the cytoskeleton             of excluding compartments, and molecular genetics techniques to                 disrupt the function of ABP280.  Ultimately, information obtained               from this research should lead to an understanding of the effects               of cytoarchitecture on diffusion and localization of intracellular              components, and stimulate testable hypotheses regarding the                     function and regulation of excluding compartments.                              %%%                                                                             Much current thinking about cellular biochemistry and metabolism is             extrapolated from assays performed in homogeneous, dilute solution.             However, the interior of a cell is neither dilute, nor homogeneous.             The intracellular concentration of certain enzymes is orders of                 magnitude higher than the concentrations commonly used to assay                 enzyme activity in vitro, and the total protein concentration may               be as high as 200 to 300 mg/ml.  Sophisticated experiments                      employing a variety of biophysical and other techniques have                    demonstrated the existence of \"structure\" (other than the better-               understood membrane-bound compartmentation) within what has until               recently been considered an amorphous cytoplasm.  This project will             further define the nature and function of this cytoplasmic                      structure.  The work is significant not only for what it can help               us understand about the function of the living cell, but also                   potentially as a model for a new generation of synthetic materials              of functionally defined porosities.",
