 "awd_abstract_narration": "Four campuses of the University of Massachusetts system                         (Amherst, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Boston) have designed a                        regional network to support the high school physics teachers                    in the area.  Each campus will offer a three-week commuter                      workshop, at which 24 teachers will learn about contemporary                    research topics in physics and strategies for incorporating                     this new content knowledge into their classroom instruction.                    The most experienced teachers at these workshops will be                        invited to attend a week-long residential institute devoted                     to developing new classroom activities based on the research                    topics presented.  These activities will be disseminated to                     all school districts in the region, and through the                             Massachusetts Statewide Systemic Initiative, Project PALMS.                     Each campus will also establish a permanent teachers                            resource center within its physics department.  The centers                     will offer teachers the loan of equipment for classroom use,                    and will provide ongoing help in the form of workshops,                         network meetings, newsletters, and interactions with members                    of the research faculty.                                                                                                                                        Partnerships such as this between research universities and                     secondary schools have significant potential for long-term                      improvement of science education.  The regional scale of                        this partnership is exceptional and increases further the                       opportunity for widespread permanent improvement.                                                                                                               Cost sharing on this project represents 22% of the NSF                          contribution.",
