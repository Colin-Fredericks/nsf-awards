 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical research on foliation                  theory.  The main emphasis will be the application of the methods               of algebraic topology (secondary characteristic classes) and                    spectral geometry.  Work will be done investigating the index and               spectrum of transversal Dirac operators on a foliated space,                    associated Cheeger-Chern-Simons classes, eta invariant and                      families of transversal Dirac operators parametrized by suitable                moduli spaces.  Applications to mathematical physics, in                        particular to gauge theory on foliated spaces, and global                       chiral anomalies will be further pursued.  The overall objective                of the project is to establish via heat equation methods and the                theory of spectral asymptotics on singular spaces, an index                     theorem for transversally elliptic operators on the basic section               of a Riemannian Foliation.  The main requirement is that the                    theorem and its extensions would be explicitly given in terms of                data relative to the transversal geometry of the foliation and of               the spectral properties of the associated zeta-function.                             The study of foliations in geometric analysis is a natural                 generalization of domains for differential operators.                           These operators can be shown to act in particularly simple ways                 on sets which decompose domains in a layer fashion.  On the                     layers it is possible to analyze many operators using analogues                 of some of the fundamental tools applied to the study of                        differential equations.",
