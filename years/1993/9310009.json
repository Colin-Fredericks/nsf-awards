The first two projects concern agents  who frequently interact with others in strategic situations, and  explore whether they come to play the game by accumulating  experience about how their opponents have played in the past.  The  first project explores the plausibility of mixed strategy  equilibria where players are heterogeneous because of differing  experience.  The second project explores a fundamental assumption  of many models of learning, and argues that because of the dynamics  of the interactions, learning is more likely to lead to some  equilibrium outcomes than to others.  The third project studies  agents choosing between competing technologies whose problem is a  social one only because they can gain information by looking at the  choices of others.  The research focuses on the implications of  very simple behavioral patterns in models which may be applied to  such problems as the choice of farming technologies and the  structure of labor contracts.    ***",
