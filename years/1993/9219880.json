 "awd_abstract_narration": "Circadian rhythms are an adaptation of organisms to the regular                 daily change of their environment.  Although much is known about                the formal properties of circadian rhythms which allow them to                  synchronize to the daily light\\dark cycles, almost nothing is known             about how these rhythms work on a biochemical level. This project               is two-fold.  First, the simplest organism now known to express                 circadian rhythms will be used namely, prokaryotic cyanobacteria.               Second, genetic tools will be used to analyze its mechanism.  A                 reporter gene encoding a bioluminescence enzyme has been attached               to an endogenous promoter.  Not only does this construct make these             cyanobacteria bioluminescent, the glow meets all of the salient                 criteria of circadian rhythmicity|  This is the first \"artificial\"              overt rhythm of a circadian clock yet described.                                This unique case of circadian gene expression will be exploited to:             (1) identify by action spectroscopy the photoreceptor involved in               the clock's entrainment; (2) analyze the control pathway by which               the circadian clock regulates this \"artificial rhythm; and (3)                  search for genes which are involved in the clock's central                      mechanism.  Using a simple prokaryotic system should accelerate the             identification of cellular mechanisms by which circadian                        oscillators operate.                                                            %%%                                                                             Most organisms respond to the cycles of light and dark by                       physiological mechanisms that are not well understood.  Plants                  respond to these cycles by turning on and off certain genes.  By                genetic manipulation these investigators have introduce a light                 emitting enzyme gene into a gene that is turned on by a daily                   light-dark cycle. Thus after light exposure these bacteria will                 begin to glow as the gene is turned on.  This novel technique will              allow the investigators to better understand the biochemical                    genetic mechanisms by which organisms respond to light-dark cycles.",
