 "awd_abstract_narration": "930403  Steindler    The cerebral cortex provides the neural substrate for  thinking, perception, and memory.  It is divided into a mosaic  of regions with different cellular composition and  connections.  Each region is specified to process a particular  type of information.  Some regions process information from  sensory receptors, others process information coming from  brain centers that program responses.  How this differentiated  mosaic develops from an undifferentiated equipotential  embryonic matrix is a subject on intense interest and  controversy.  This NSF Small Grant for Exploratory Research  will enable Dr. Steindler to explore the role of an  extracellular matrix molecule called tenascin in the formation  of cortical boundaries.  Tenascin is secreted by neuroglia,  the non-neuronal support cells of the nervous system.  It is  found at the boundaries of cortical regions early in  development but disappears by maturity.  Dr. Steindler  hypothesizes that this molecule forms a barrier between  adjacent regions and prevents mixing of fiber afferents.  He  will use newly developed antibodies to tenascin to study the  role of this molecule in the formation of regional boundaries  in the \"whisker-barrel field,\" an area of cortex with  regionally distinct boundaries that are easily discerned.   Since tenascin has a widespread distribution in the animal  kingdom, this work should provide insight into general  mechanisms of pattern formation during development.  More  specifically the results will have implications for theories  of cortical development and cortical regeneration after injury  in the adult.   ***",
