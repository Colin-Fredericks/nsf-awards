 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308132  Bitterman    Although invertebrates comprise more than 95% of all animal species, there has  been very little careful scientific study of their intelligence.  Few invertebrate  species actually are suitable for the purpose, which requires that they be  abundantly available, live well in or near the laboratory, and have manageable  sensory, motor, and motivational properties.  Dr. Bitterman and his colleagues  have been studying honeybees, which are highly evolved invertebrates that do  meet these requirements and are also of great economic importance (honey  production and the pollination of crops).  For the most part, Dr. Bitterman uses  individual foragers that come of their own accord to the laboratory, where they  work for sucrose solution to take back to their hives.  The experiments carried out  thus far show many detailed similarities in the learning of honeybees and  vertebrates, similarities that are surprising in view of the vast differences in brain  structure and the remoteness of the evolutionary relationship (the two lines of  animals have been evolving independently from a primitive common ancestor over  a period of 500 million years).  As the tasks set for the animals become  increasingly complex, Dr. Bitterman expects to find differences in performance  that reflect the absence in honeybees of certain advanced vertebrate capabilities,  differences that should help to define more clearly both the common and the  advanced capabilities.  The present phase of the work deals with such phenomena  as the selection and integration of concurrent sensory inputs; the integration of  present and remembered inputs; inhibitory control of behavior; and the rules of  choice.",
