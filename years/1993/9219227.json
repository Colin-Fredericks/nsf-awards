 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baculoviruses, insect viruses, are the focus of intense interest                because of their remarkable ability to hyperexpress and process                 foreign eukaryotic genes and their potential use as insecticides.               Despite this widespread interest, the mechanism by which                        baculoviruses replicate is unknown. This proposal is based upon                 recent work in our laboratory which identified and characterized                the origins of replication from two baculoviruses genomes, the                  first time such sequences have been identified. The long term goal              of this project is to use plasmids containing replication origin                sequences to develop a detailed understanding of the mechanism by               which DNA is replicated in baculoviruses. This includes the                     characterization of the structure of the origins of DNA                         replication, the identification of genes necessary to the process,              and elucidating the function of those genes. Since the                          transcription of the late genes is dependent upon DNA replication,              the results of this work should also make it possible to elucidate              the processes involved in late transcription.                                   %%%                                                                             Information derived from this project will not only enhance our                 understanding of a basic biological mechanism but will also be of               practical use, in that it will facilitate the design of recombinant             baculovirus for use as expression vectors and as insecticides.",
