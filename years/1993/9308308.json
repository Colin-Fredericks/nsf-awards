 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of intelligent robot planning techniques is an             essential element of future underwater and space exploration and                industrial automation.  These technologies find application in                  autonomous underwater and planetary rovers, autonomous rendezvous               and docking, operation and maintenance of a nuclear power plant,                extravehicular activity, autonomous landers, robotic and                        telerobotic control and automation, and in the general construction             and operation of a laboratory, ship or industrial site.  The                    purpose of this project is to increase the efficiency and                       effectiveness of robot planning by making use of parallel hardware              and machine learning techniques.  The project is made up to two                 component parts, each of which contributes independently and                    collectively to the automation of robotic activity.  The first                  subproject focuses on developing parallel algorithms for heuristic              search, which is a fundamental component in robot planning.  The                second subproject focuses on incremental modification and reuse of              plans by searching for similarities between old and new plans.                  These two projects have been developed and tested on several search             and planning problems.  We propose to extend the existing research              by improving the parallel search algorithms, developing parallel                planning algorithms, and applying dynamic graph match to allow                  reuse of plans in a dynamically changing environment.//",
