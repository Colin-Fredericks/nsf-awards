 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313510  Hemberger       Roanoke College has been recognized as one of the most  rapidly improving undergraduate programs in the South, as  evidenced by recent increases in the quality of its  applicants and the research accomplishments of its faculty,  especially in the sciences. The number of declared science  majors at Roanoke College has increased by 27%, which stands  in stark contrast to the downward national trend. Student  involvement with faculty research is commonplace.       The Science Center complex at Roanoke College is a five-  story, 120,000 square foot structure that houses the  College's scientific research and research training  activities. Since its construction in 1971, research labs in  the complex have suffered from ground water infiltration,  and the building's ventilation, plumbing, and electrical  systems have aged to a point that they no longer serve the  rapidly growing science program. The proposed renovation  will address these problems, thereby enabling the College to  1) support the research activities of its faculty, 2)  provide suitable environments for research equipment, 3)  offer research training as a part of undergraduate  coursework, 4) create opportunities for joint student-  faculty research, and 5) attract students to careers in  science.  ***",
