 "awd_abstract_narration": "The complement activation fragment anaphylatoxin C5a is the most                potent plasma-derived chemotactic factor known.  This humoral                   factor induces leukocyte activation at low nonamolar                            concentrations.  Investigating the molecular requirements for the               interaction of C5a with its cellular receptor, present on                       polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMNs) and monocytes, has been a                 long time interest of the P.I.  While modelling studies up to now               focused mainly on the ligand, i.e. C5a molecule, recent cloning of              the PMN C5a-receptor (C5aR) and publication of the amino-acid                   sequence makes it possible to investigate the receptor-ligand                   binding interactions and receptor triggering events at the                      molecular level.  Analyses of ligand binding site of this                       membrane-spanning receptor, and molecular arrangement of the seven              transmembrane domains can also be explored.                                     The goals of this study are to collect preliminary data and show                feasibility for developing a program to investigate C5a-C5aR                    interaction, using site-specific receptor peptides and poly- and                monoclonal antibodies.  Selective blocking of ligand binding by                 polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies will identify and map                      molecular regions on the receptor that participate in C5a binding.              Identifying these local sites on the receptor will not only                     facilitate an understanding of the molecular requirements for                   ligand-receptor interactions, but provide a model for receptor-                 ligand interactions as well.  This work will also identify regions              of special interest for site-specific mutagenesis studies.                      %%%                                                                             C5a is a principal mediator in eliciting both local and systemic                inflammatory responses.  It interacts with a membrane bound                     receptor, C5aR, which has recently been cloned.  Understanding                  these receptor-ligand interactions and receptor triggering events               at the molecular level will provide a model for receptor-ligand                 interactions in general; and in addition might generate potential               inhibitors of C5aR-mediated cell activation.",
