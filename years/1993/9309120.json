 "awd_abstract_narration": "Effective techniques to perform in-circuit reconfiguration for                  FPGAs may lead to a new generation of fault-tolerant computer                   systems for high reliability and high performance applications.                 Future programmable computer architectures could allow software                 running on the hardware platform to dynamically adjust the                      architecture according to the current task.                                                                                                                     This research is concerned with the diagnosis and reconfiguration               of re-programmable Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  In                  particular, the effort focuses on the design of FPGA interconnect               diagnosis algorithms, development of in-circuit reconfiguration                 strategies for fault tolerance and change of functionality, and the             establishment of a theoretical framework for self-adjustable FPGA               systems.                                                                                                                                                        Since an FPGA contains many connection wires and switches and                   requires a great amount of diagnosis time, especially if the                    diagnosis has to be done often, fast-diagnosis algorithm time                   implies a great saving in time and resources, and greater                       reliability.  Fast diagnosis algorithms will also benefit other                 areas where interconnect diagnosis is important, such as VLSI, MCM              and PCB production.",
