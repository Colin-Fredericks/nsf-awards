 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, MS Patricia Capone will               collect data for her doctoral dissertation. She will examine the                response of Native Americans in the U.S. Southwest to Spanish                   missionization which took place during the 17th century. Beginning              in about 1630 the Spanish established a number of missions in this              region with a goal both of converting Native Americans to                       Christianity and of integrating them into a Spanish economic                    system. Native Americans were forced to provide labor to the                    missions. While it is clear that missions did have a major effect               on Native American lifeways, the nature and degree of change is                 less well understood. It is also not known how uniformly different              Native American groups adapted.                                                                                                                                 The goal of this research is to use locally produced ceramics to                examine this issue. In the prehistoric Southwest and continuing                 into historic times ceramics were widely produced and traded over               broad areas. Some decorated types were moved great distances and                likely were produced by specialists in localized areas. Ceramics                therefore provide insight into economic and trade organization as               well as - more indirectly - into political and social structures.               MS Capone will examine two Pueblos at Abo, New Mexico, and Awatovi,             Arizona which are located at the Eastern and Western ends of the                Pueblo region respectively. She will study the geology of each area             to locate and characterize clay sources. She will then study                    ceramic materials from both sites by means of petrographic thin                 section analysis. On this basis she will be able to tie vessels to              raw material source areas. She will also look as such factors as                uniformity of production to determine the degree of craft                       specialization. Each site spans the pre-mission and mission periods             and therefore MS Capone will be able to examine the issue of                    continuity and change. Preliminary work suggests that native                    Americans were more resistant to change by missionization than                  historic data suggests.                                                                                                                                         This research is important because it will increase our                         understanding of how very different cultures interact with each                 other. It will shed new light on culture change and assist in the               training of a promising young scientist.",
