 "awd_abstract_narration": "The novel concept offered in this proposal was to introduce                metal colloids/precipitates in the ceramics, and to enhance the                 toughness and ductility properties of the ceramics.  Precipitate                sizes and their number density are to be optimized in the synthesis             and processing part of this proposed work.  Detailed material                   characterization and modeling of toughness and ductility are to be              used to correlate microstructures with the mechanical properties of             the ceramics.  This proposal intends to investigate the cases of                metal colloids/precipitates in MgO or Al2O3 ceramics.  Metals can               be transition metals such as Ni.                                                %%%                                                                             This project investigates metal colloids/precipitates in MgO or                 Al2O3 ceramics.  It offers the metal colloids/precipitates as                   infinite sources of dislocations, which contribute to the                       improvements in toughness as well as to ductility.  If provides                 great potentials in expanding the possible applications of ceramics             as structural elements.  Potential benefits to the industrial usage             of ceramics can be very substantial.",
