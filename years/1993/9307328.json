 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307328  Ng  This project will investigate high-Tc materials using low  temperature scanning tunneling microscopy.  A ultra-high-vacuum  system has been built to allow a study of tunneling as a function  of angle with respect to the superconductor surface.  In this way  the anisotropy in the tunneling current will be sought.  This can  be related to anisotropy in the density of electronic states of the  high-Tc materials, and provides input to and tests of current  theories of high-Tc materials.  The measurements will determine how  the anisotropy is influenced by temperature variation, scattering  processes, and the coupling strength between CuO2 layers.  %%%  This project studies the arrangement of electrons in the high-Tc  superconducting materials.  The high-Tc materials are characterized  by planes composed of copper and oxygen atoms.  Within these CuO2  planes, the arrangement of electron charge is anisotropic, but  direct measurements to determine the anisotropy are very difficult.   This project will use tunneling microscopy to detect electrons  having the surface at various angles.  The resulting anisotropy  will be used to test current theories and will provide important  fundamental information about the high-Tc materials.  The  information is also relevant to potential technology in that  superconducting devices may depend on the anisotropic properties of  the high-Tc materials.  ***",
