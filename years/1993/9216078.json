 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes using a magnetically stabilized fluidized                   bed (MSFB) to separate zwitterionic molecules (i.e., molecules                  containing negatively and positively charged moieties) by                       virtue of differing isoelectric values (i.e., the pH at which                   the molecule is not charged).  The fluidized bed consists of a                  tube in which negatively charged resin particles are added                      from the top of the tube, and the fluidizing liquid is                          distributed from the bottom.  Removal of the particles from                     the bottom, and liquid from the top allows for continuous                       operation.  A pH gradient is maintained in the bed by                           inserting the liquid feed at a high pH and the solid particles                  at a low pH.  A mixture containing dissolved solutes (one of                    which is targeted for separation) is fed into the liquid                        stream somewhere near the bottom, and to one side of the                        column.  As the solute moves up the bed by virtue of the                        liquid motion, the local pH that the solute is exposed to                       decreases.  The reduction in the local pH causes the solutes                    to eventually become positively charged (at the positions in                    the bed just above the positions where the local pH is equal                    to the isoelectric values of the solutes).  Once positively                     charged, the solute binds electrostatically to the negatively                   charged resin, and is carried with the resin particles down to                  the bottom of the column.  As it descends down the column, the                  local pH decreases, and this causes the solute to reverse its                   charge, remove itself from the resin particle, and become                       entrained in the upflowing liquid.  The solute thus becomes                     trapped in a narrow zone at a level in the column where the                     local pH is equal to the solute's isoelectric point.  Ideally,                  the solutes in the mixture will separate out into zones                         occupying different levels in the column.  By withdrawing                       fluid and solid from these zones, liquid rich in one solute                     can be obtained, thereby effecting the separation.  The                         proposed research will develop a working prototype, and scope                   the effectiveness of the bed to prepare separations of                          biological molecules.",
