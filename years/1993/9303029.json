 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303029  Deng       Light signals from the environment are perceived by specific  regulatory photoreceptors in plants and transduced by unknown  mechanisms to control growth and development.  The long term goal  of this research is to dissect the molecular mechanisms by which  such signals are transduced and integrated to modulate plant  development.  The light-regulated seedling development of  Arabidopsis thaliana has been used as a model experimental system  in my laboratory.  Nine COP (constitutive photomorphogenic) loci,  which when mutated produce dark-grown seedlings with a morphology  resembling that of light-grown wild-type seedlings, have been  identified.  The Arabidopsis COP1 (constitutive photomorphogenic)  locus, which plays a central role in the light signaling process  and encodes a novel protein with putative DNA-binding and G-protein  homology domains, represents the only light signaling component  besides phytochrome that has been characterized in a molecular  term.  The preliminary studies in my laboratory indicate that the  cop9 mutation results in the same range of phenotype as the cop1  mutants.  Therefore COP9 and COP1 may encode closely related  regulatory components in the same signaling pathway.  It is  proposed here to clone and sequence the COP9 locus, by using an  available T-DNA insertional mutant allele.  After determining the  molecular identity of the COP9 gene, appropriate probes (DNA and  antibodies) will be developed for the molecular analysis and COP9  promoter-GUS transgenic plants will be generated for analyzing  expression pattern of the COP9 gene.  With these tools available,  it will enable us to determine at the molecular level 1) how the  wild-type COP9 gene product couples light signals and seedling  development, and 2) the relationship between the COP1 and COP9  genes.  Furthermore, the regulatory hierarchy of COP9 and other  identified photomorphogenic loci during light-regulated seedling  development will be analyzed.  %%%  Accomplishment of these  studies will not only ascertain the nature  of a critical regulatory component that links light signals to  seedling development, but also provide clues as to how the COP9  relates to other photomorphogenic genes.  ***",
