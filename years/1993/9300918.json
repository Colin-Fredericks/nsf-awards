 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of inference problems in nonparametric function  estimation will be investigated during the course of this  project. The problems to be considered include i) estimation of  breakpoints for regression functions or their derivatives, ii)  development of practical confidence bands for use in  nonparametric regression, iii) construction of diagnostic  goodness-of-fit tests using nonparametric function estimation  methodology in a variety of settings, including censored data and  additive models, and iv) spline smoothing with correlated errors.       It is often reasonable to believe in many areas of science,  such as biology, engineering, psychology, etc., that the data  being collected is produced by two components: a nonrandom  component, representing a characteristic of nature  common to all  individuals or subjects, and a random component that accounts for  individual variation. This nonrandom component represents the  understandable or predictable aspect of the phenomenon being  studied and is therefore of considerable interest. Nonparametric  function estimation is an area of statistics concerned with the  development of flexible methods for estimating or describing the  nonrandom components of data.  The current research project deals  with a variety of problems in nonparametric function estimation  including i) the development of procedures for estimating a point  where an abrupt change has occurred in some phenomenon (e.g.,  locating a point of sudden change in the discharge of water from  a river or prices of a commodity) ii) the construction of  accuracy measures (similar to those associated with popularity  polls, etc.) to accompany nonparametric function estimators and  iii) the development of statistical methods to assess the  accuracy of models that have been postulated by scientists to  describe various processes they are studying.",
