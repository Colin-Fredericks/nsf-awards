The meeting, jointly  organized by Prof. Eugene Fabes of the University of  Minnesota and Prof. Wilfredo Urbina of the Universidad  Central de Venezuela, will serve to honor Prof. Mischa  Cotlar on his 80th birthday and provide an opportunity  for Venezuelan and other Latin American mathematicians  to establish contacts, exchange ideas, and develop  cooperative research activities in the subject area  with leading mathematicians from the U.S., Europe, and  other Latin American countries.    Professor Cotlar's career in Latin America has been  notable, not only for his outstanding research but  also for his role in educating many of the leading  mathematicians from the region.  The conference will  serve to give an overview of the current research  areas in which Professor Cotlar is active and will  encourage communication and cooperation between the  participants.  ***",
