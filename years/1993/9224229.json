 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global attention has focused on the recently created                            extractive reserves in the Brazilian Amazon as a                                promising new land use strategy that encourages the                             simultaneous use and conservation of the rainforest.                            Although the extractive community has utilized and                              managed the forest for decades, this new mandate                                coupled with increasing population densities demands a                          higher level of management sophistication.  The                                 scientific community can play an important role in the                          testing of various production strategies open to these                          rainforest producers; however, research has been very                           limited.                                                                                                                                                        The proposed research will assist extractivists in                              Acre, Brazil in evaluating technological options                                designed to increase sustainable production of the                              native species, Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa Humb.                          & Bompl.), valued for its many traditional uses and                             great economic value.  Study objectives are to examine:                         (1) Brazil nut seed germination success comparing the                           effects of date of fruit fall, seed size, and seed                              pretreatment.  These data will provide practical                                information for seed collection and storage as well as                          specific scientific data on the causes of the observed                          slow and uneven germination.  (2) Brazil nut seedling                           establishment success in three areas within the                                 reserves: (a) Forest gaps, (b) Shifting cultivation                             plots, and (c) Pastures, employing two inexpensive                              planting techniques and post-planting regimes.  These                           experiments will determine how Brazil nut responds                              physiologically to varied planting environments, and                            what factors limit seedling establishment and early                             growth.  (3) Role of Brazil nut in the extractivist                             production system, comparing traditional uses and                               management of the species with changes to the system                            created by the introduced Brazil nut enrichment                                 technologies.                                                                   %%%                                                                             Documentation of traditional management and uses will                           assist in understanding indigenous techniques that have                         maintained the species over generations and may yield                           valuable information for development of potential                               market products.  Understanding changes generated by                            the new establishment technologies will facilitate                              critical evaluation on a socio-economic and biological                          level.",
