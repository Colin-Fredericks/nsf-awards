 "awd_abstract_narration": "A seven day workshop is proposed for 24 high school science                     (biology, chemistry and physics) and mathematics teachers                       from across the nation.  The teachers will experience first                     hand an unusual systematic instructional strategy which                         employs open ended problem solving techniques.                                                                                                                  During the first three days the participants work in                            interdisciplinary teams of four to devise a product that                        addresses a problem or need in an assigned field e.g safety                     or energy conservation.  Workshop participants are                              encouraged to call upon companies as they develop their                         solution and  are encouraged to consider how to capitalize                      on the industrial interests and talent available.  In                           addition a key test of a team's solution to a problem is                        found in the presentation to a review board.                                                                                                                    The second half of the workshop participants are teamed with                    other teachers from the same discipline.  The task is again                     problem solving with teachers working to develop curricular                     modules for use in their high school classrooms which                           incorporate the problem solving techniques they have                            learned.                                                                                                                                                        Each teacher who participates will present at least one in-                     service program in their home district during the year                          following their participation in the workshop.                                                                                                                  The program is for four years with four teachers from the                       previous year returning to the workshop to serve as \"master                     teachers\".  These teaching assistants will develop a manual                     for dissemination and use in future workshops.
