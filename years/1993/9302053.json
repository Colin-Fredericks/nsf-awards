 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary research will investigate the mechanical                 behavior of model joints in metal matrix composites and its                     relationship to defects and microstructural features developed                  during processing.  Research will focus on joint geometries                     commonly found in designing with advanced materials, including both             composite-composite and composite-monolithic combinations.  Fiber               coatings will be used to control the interfacial characteristics of             the composites and to develop an understanding of end effects in                weakly and strongly bonded systems.  Particular emphasis will be                placed on the evolution of defects and relevant microstructural                 features during diffusion bonding, and their role in deformation                micromechanics and properties of the joint.  Tests will be                      conducted at elevated and ambient temperatures under various                    loading conditions and the results related to emerging constitutive             laws developed for monolithic and for composite materials.  This                research should assist in the construction of predictive models for             the behavior of joint systems using the principles of                           micromechanics and processing science.",
