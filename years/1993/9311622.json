 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311622  Lee  The goal of this project is to develop efficient algorithms  for the automated analysis of communicating systems and  distributed real-time systems.  We base this research on a  general framework, called a Communicating Timed State  Machine with Probability (CTSMP).  CTSMPs are state machines  that communicate messages synchronously over one-to-many  channels.  In addition, CTSMPs support several features that  are useful in describing real-time computer systems.  Examples of such features include local variables, timed  state transmissions, and probabilistic state transitions.  The compositional semantics of CTSMPs allows a complex  system to be specified as a collection of simple machines  that communicate and synchronize with one another.  The  inclusion of both timed state transitions and probabilistic  state transitions allows the modeling of faults and timing  properties in the same framework.    The fundamental issue in the automated analysis of  communicating systems is the efficient generation of the  reachable state space. For finite state systems, the problem  is state explosion.  For infinite state systems, it is not  possible to generate all the states; instead, we need to  find a way of combining sets of states.  There are two  approaches to address the state explosion and exploration  problem:  1) reduce the state space either through efficient  encoding or by clustering sets of equivalent states; and 2)  generate or explore less space using probability. This  research employs both of these approaches and consists of  several related parts:  1) design of CTSMP state  minimization algorithms; 2) discovery of probabilistic state  generation and exploration algorithms; 3) design of  efficient model checking algorithms using CTSMP and  comparison with binary decision diagram based algorithms;  and 4) improving the efficiency of the above algorithms  using parallelism and randomization.  This project will  implement these algorithms and evaluate their effectiveness  exper imentally.  ***",
