 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352140  Molnar  We are modernizing and improving the undergraduate General  Physics Lab taught at Douglass College, the nation's largest  women's college, which is located at Rutgers University.  The  female students who take General Physics I and II at Douglass  College primarily plan to major in math, science, and  engineering.  A substantial number of them are minority  students. The General Physics Lab has been taught separately  from the lecture course with a weak connection in topics.  It  has emphasized tedious data-taking and quantitative  verification of physical laws.  In order to provide greater  instructional support for these students, who do more poorly in  General Physics than students on other campuses, we have  completely modernized the General Physics Lab sections taught  at Douglass College, in addition to tightly coupling the  experiments to the material covered in lecture each week.  The  modernization encompasses the introduction of computer-aided  experiments along with replacing outmoded apparatus.  We have  obtained a dozen Macintosh microcomputers with lab interfaces  and sensors to run Microprocessor Based Laboratory experiments.   We have also replaced of our air tracks, optics, and  electrostatics experiments.  Our objective is to build in our  students an intuitive feeling for physical concepts through  hands-on experience in the laboratory.  The new experiments are  based upon our success with minilabs in other courses, which  focuses on understanding physics principles as they are  concurrently discussed in lecture. We feel it is particularly  apt to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Douglass College by  changing our way of teaching physics at Douglass so that  physics is no longer a major hurdle in a woman's path to a  scientific career, and thus, to career equality.  ***",
