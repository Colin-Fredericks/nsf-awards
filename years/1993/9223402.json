 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intense specialization in all fields of knowledge often                    precludes contact by scientists with common interests in                        environmental problems.  A traditional vehicle for promoting                    cross-disciplinary research on important topics is conferences                  organized around a specific scientific research theme.  This                    award continues NSF support for a project that has brought                      together a group of recognized experts on all aspects of social                 and ecological research in order to write a comprehensive history               of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin.  The project focuses on                   long-term ecological change leading to present day problems                     facing the ecosystem, including both human and natural causes of                change.  One conference already has been held to bring together                 recognized authorities to exchange ideas and research findings.                 A second conference will reconvene this group and allow them to                 make arrangements for revisions in individually written chapter                 texts, which should result in a more coherent and synthetic                     volume that documents and explains how human and natural forces                 have shaped the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem.                                            Through this innovative project, biological scientists from                several specialties are assessing problems of natural change in                 concert with historians and anthropologists, who are focusing on                the impacts of human activity.  The result will be a                            comprehensive study of the Chesapeake Bay drainage basin, which                 in addition to providing valuable new information and insights                  about that region, will also provide a benchmark for integrative                analyses of other regions.",
