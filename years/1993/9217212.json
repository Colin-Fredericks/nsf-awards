 "awd_abstract_narration": "This two-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                   in numerical methods and parallel algorithms in materials                       processing.  The investigators are J. Iwan D. Alexander of the                  University of Alabama, Patrick Bontoux and Jalil Ouazzani of the                Institute for Fluid Mechanics in Marseille, France.  The objective              of the research is to integrate parallel computing strategies with              computational problems in materials processing.  The                            investigators will identify and develop techniques and algorithms               with which to solve materials processing models.  Then they will                apply the methods to crystal growth and transport processes in                  other fluid systems.  The research focuses on developing new                    predictive models. Current numerical methods and models are                     limited and large computation times are required to produce                     meaningful solutions.  The results of this research will advance                predictive capabilities in materials processing, in particular, for             highly complex processing situations.                                                                                                                           Dr. Alexander brings to this collaboration his expertise with                   materials process modeling and techniques.  The code                            development requirements will be significantly strengthened by                  the considerable expertise of the French investigators in this area             and in fluid dynamics. The investigators complementary expertise                provides a sound basis for the collaboration.",
