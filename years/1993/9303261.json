 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will relate nutrient cycling to long term productivity             of agroecosystems by comparing nutrient cycles that prevail under               agricultural methods in ancient and complex Chinese agroecosystems              with those of conventional farms.  With nitrogen often being the                limiting nutrient in such systems, nitrogen (N) - cycling is the                main focus of the study, with other nutrient cycles to be also                  characterized where useful.  N-cycling patterns are to be modeled               from annual N-transfer budgets of village-scale agroecosystems.                 Food web and trophic chain models of N-cycling will be compared for             their ability to differentiate agroecosystem behaviors, and various             calculations will be assessed for their suitability in quantifying              nutrient cycling.  A nitrogen-recycling-efficiency index will be                derived from N-cycling measures combined with input/output                      efficiency criteria and soil N pool size.  This index will be                   related to ecological sustainability using as a benchmark Chinese               agroecosystems that have sustained high yields for centuries.  The              contemporary importance of legume cultivation to sustained                      agroecosystem productivity will then be evaluated using the N-                  recycling index.                                                                %%%                                                                             Traditional Chinese agroecosystems and the eco-farms derived from               them are striking examples of environmental management based upon               ecological principles.  Nutrient cycling patterns of such systems               provide an excellent contrast to Chinese farms that use only                    conventional chemical nutrient management.  All three agroecosystem             types (traditional, eco-farm, conventional) may be found in the                 same bioclimatic area of China; the combination of all three types              in a comparative study constitutes a unique opportunity to develop              measurements of sustainability.",
