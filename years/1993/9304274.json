 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first portion of this research is concerned with the  computation of Bayesian predictive densities in settings where  the predictive density does not have a tractable form.  Such  settings occur in stochastic network models where flowgraph  methods can be used to derive their moment generating functions.  Saddlepoint methods are then used to convert these generating  functions into densities and cumulant generating functions.   Subsequent mixing over the posterior distribution is accomplished  with either simulation or the analytic method of Laplace.  We  also develop importance sampling methods for p-value computation  in multivariate analysis.  Virtually all the common tests in this  subject area will be computable with the simulation schemes we  shall develop and the run times should amount to less than five  minutes on a work station.  Additional work dealing with  approximation of responses in non-linear stochastic systems is to  be considered.  Systems theory encompasses such things as the study of production  management, where the flow of products along an assembly line is  of interest, queuing theory, reliability of electrical networks,  flow of traffic on a highway system, etc.  The mathematical study  of these systems when they are subject to randomness is based on  an area of mathematics called transform theory.  So far transform  theory has not proven to be a particularly useful tool to the  more practical engineer for extracting practical answers about  systems.  Engineers are mostly inclined to use very  time-consuming computer simulations for this analysis.  This  research is concerned with applying new mathematical tools called  saddlepoint approximations to these problems that will allow  practical answers to be extracted from the transform theory.  Where a random system might now take 10 hours of computer  simulation to analyze, it should take only minutes on the  computer to analyze when the full power of these saddlepoint  approximations are combined with the existing pow er of transform  theory.  This research is concerned with using saddlepoint  approximations to analyze systems and for extracting practical  answers about such systems. Statistical analyses that involve  more than one variable often require that the data are analyzed  using multivariate methods.  In this setting testing the  significance of various hypotheses is not easily accomplished  since the computation of attained levels of significance is not  exact and requires approximation.  The proposed research offers  special computer simulation methods that will lead to virtually  exact computation of attained significance levels for the  majority of multivariate tests.",
