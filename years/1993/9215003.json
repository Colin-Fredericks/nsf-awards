 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research in field theory and commutative               algebra.  The principal investigator will study the relationship                between the multiplicative structure of field extensions which                  are Galois and certain associated groups and invariants.  He will               also work on a scheme for computing Picard groups of affine rings               over fields that are not necessarily algebraically closed. The                  computations are heavily influenced by the multiplicative                       structure of the finite extensions of the base field.                                A ring is an algebraic object having both an addition and a                multiplication defined on it.  Every element a in the ring has an               additive inverse usually denoted -a.  However, elements are not                 required to have multiplicative inverses.  A ring in which every                nonzero element has a multiplicative inverse is called a field.                 This project concerns the relationship between the multiplicative               structure of a field and that of its subfields.  It involves a                  combination of techniques from field theory, group theory and                   number theory.",
