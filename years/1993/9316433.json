One meeting, the  second annual Computation and Neural Systems meeting will be held the first  week of August in Washington DC.  Approximately 300 scientists are expected  to register and present a wide range of research results in computational  neuroscience.  The second meeting is the annual meeting of the Society for  Neuroscience and will also be held in Washington, D.C. at the beginning of  November.  This meeting will register upwards of 15,000 neurobiologists and  represents the premier meeting on neurobiology in the world.  The primary  purpose of the demonstrations are to expose large numbers of neuroscientists  to the  use of computer simulation techniques in neurobiology.  In addition, the  project will provide technical information on the methods used in these  simulations, the range of simulation software currently available, and  demonstrations of several aspects of new computer technology that are  relevant to efforts to simulate and understand the brain.     This project is supported by the Division of Integrative Biology and  Neuroscience and the Computational Biology Activities Program.***",
