ANNs are inherently parallel in structure, they  distribute knowledge throughout the system rather than  concentrating it in specific locations, and they are fault-  tolerant, learning from and making decisions based on incomplete,  noisy, or imprecise information.  Because of these  characteristics, ANNs offer great potential for future use in  processing of geographic information, but that potential has not  been widely explored by geographers and regional scientists.  Working with an Austrian collaborator, an American geographer  will explore a number of potential uses for ANNs in geographic  research.  Attention in this project will focus on applications  to the study of spatial interaction.  Application-dependent  neural spatial interaction predictors will be designed,  implemented, and tested, as will unsupervised ANN-based  interaction pattern detectors.  ANN approaches to these problems  will be compared with traditional statistical approaches through  empirical testing with data on Austrian inter-regional telephone  calls.       This project constitutes an exploratory look into the  potential for using ANN approaches in the analysis of  geographical patterns and processes.  By focusing on spatial  interaction, the investigators will explore new analytical  perspectives on an important topic for which conventional  approaches are well established.  Regardless of the outcomes of  these comparisons, scientists in geography, regional science,  computer science, and related fields will benefit from this  research on an innovative new approach to problem solving.  ***",
