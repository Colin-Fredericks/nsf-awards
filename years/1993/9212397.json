This facility will                          support current and future needs of NSF-supported projects at IMS               and nearby marine laboratories (Duke University Marine                          Laboratory; National Marine Fisheries Service Laboratory).                      Currently, IMS has 10 active NSF research grants in the areas of                nutrient-productivity interactions, nitrogen cycling, chemical                  ecology and land margin ecosystems research (LMER) requiring on                 site DOC and DON analyses.  IMS also serves as a field station                  laboratory facility for various callaborating investigators from                UNC-CH, N.C. State                                                              University (Raleigh), East Carolina University and UNC-W. These                 investigators routinely                                                         require rapid on site DOC/DON determinations to compliment stable               isotope (Cand N) geochemistry, nutrient cycling, water quality                  and trophic interaction studies.  At least 16 current NSF and 10                federaVstate agency (NOAA, EPA, USGS, UNC Water Resources                       Research Institute, DOE'I-supported projects will benefit from a                DOC/DON analytical facility. Future expansion of  these                         analytical needs is documented within the scope of the recently-                established Duke-UNC-NOAA Cooperative Institute of  Fisheries                   Oceanography (CIFO).  An Antek model 7000 analyses, plus                        accessories will be acquired.  Equipment is designed for rapid                  and efficient analyses of a variety of liquid and gas samples and               adaptable to abovementioned research needs.  The infrastructure                 for operation, maintenance and technical support is already in                  place at IMS.  This facility is of vital importance to successful               completion of existing and development of future NSF- supported                 research thrusts in coastal North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic                 region.",
