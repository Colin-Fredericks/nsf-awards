 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kaprow  9307828    Members of hazardous occupations, such as test pilots, astronauts and firefighters, have commonly been reported as having high morale and autonomy, even in a period of extensive worker alienation.  Such morale appears to have been associated with an absence of bureaucratizing influences over the social organization of work.  This study, whose long-range goal is to contribute to our general understanding of the widespread problem of worker alienation, will examine the effects of recent introduction of external regulation on autonomy, morale and occupational culture in one such hazardous occupation: firefighters in the Fire Department of New York (the FDNY).    Morale in the FDNY appears to have been linked to an occupation culture of \"heroism\", one that celebrates voluntary sacrifice to others in the presence of material hazards.  This culture appears to have been further linked to the construction of masculine identities.  To explore how such a culture of \"heroism\" among firefighters may be changing along with worker autonomy and morale in the wake on increasing external regulation, the project will examine interrelations among these variables through two different time periods: one before significant regulation, and the other following, increasing regulation by the state and other institutions.    The investigators are particularly interested in the effects of recent increases in external control, such as state regulations about appropriate number of personnel to fight fires, appropriate firehouse behavior, modifications of entrance exams to comply with gender quotas, and other similar policies.  Th e study will examine the effect of such innovations on worker autonomy, morale, the culture of \"heroism\", and on the construction of masculine identities.  Thus, in addition to contributing to general knowledge about worker autonomy and morale, the findings of this research should contribute to knowledge about men's studies and to new viewpoints about gender stereotypes and relations, particularly in regard to women in environments where not just work, but also the culture, has been exclusively male.  ***     $         $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    -   /                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        !           !
