 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on mathematical research in the area of               special functions and their applications to a multiplicity of                   scientific questions.  Among the most important special functions               which arise in applications fall within the general class of                    hypergeometric functions, which, for example, have recently found               their way into the theory of quantum groups.  In addition to                    linear and linear fractional transformations, some of these                     functions have quadratic or higher transformations.  Quadratic                  transformations have been studied for two centuries and are                     reasonably well understood.  Cubic transformations were first                   discovered by Riemann over 125 years ago, yet they are not as                   well understood as comments in the literature lead one to think,                and while applications of them have been limited, there are some                recent very interesting ones which go back to work of Ramanujan.                These transformations will be analyzed.  Efforts will be made to                find multivariable extensions.                                                       Special functions are fundamental building blocks used in                  the approximation of complex functions, as solutions of                         differential equations and in the representation of many                        important mathematical and physical relationships.  In addition                 to their recurrence in often unexpected ways throughout science,                they generally are easy to compute or approximate numerically.",
