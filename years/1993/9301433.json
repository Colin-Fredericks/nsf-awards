A novel approach to transport in the IQHE  has been developed and will be adapted to nonlinear mesoscopic  transport and applied to the study of nonlinear time-independent  and time-dependent effects in devices.  In the IQHE this approach  will be used to study current distributions and the breakdown of  dissipationless IQHE, fundamental properties which are not  presently well understood.  The possibility of developing a novel  tunable phonon or photon laser, based on the breakdown, will be  studied.  The FQHE research will include a detailed study of the  properties and experimental consequences of edge excitations at  complicated fractions, and an investigation of the appropriate  description of bulk quasiparticle excitations.  These are important  to understand the microscopics of the FQHE.  Finally, a method  based on density functional theory will be developed which will  provide a powerful numerical tool to study the properties of an  inhomogeneous electron gas in a strong magnetic field.  %%%  The research conducted on this grant deals with one of the most  important current problems in modern condensed matter physics.  The  research focuses on the properties of a new state of matter which  is formed in a strong magnetic field at a semiconductor interface  under certain conditions.  This \"two-dimensional electron gas\" has  many unusual properties.  Besides being of fundamental interest,  these properties may have application to new and novel electronic  devices.  The work will concentrate on nonlinear transport  phenomena and a density functional formulation of the problem.   These are topics which have not received a great deal of attention.  ***",
