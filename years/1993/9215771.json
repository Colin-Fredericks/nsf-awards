On-going experiments in China indicate that                the utilization of photosynthetic heterosis in a hybrid rice,                   from a US high-light adapted ecotype crossed with a South China                 low-light adapted ecotype, is a promising approach to increasing                photosynthesis, broadening environmental adaptability, and                      increasing productivity. In this project, coordinated studies                   will be conducted to compare a hybrid rice (Le/Qi) and its                      parents to determine how photosynthesis has been modified.                      Portions of the work will be conducted at three sites -- Georgia,               Arkansas, and China.",
