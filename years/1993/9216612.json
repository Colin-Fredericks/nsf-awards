The doctoral                       candidate will study three different communities which vary in                  their commitment to a n agricultural way of life.  If successful,               this study will help us to better understand the costs and                      benefits (health, diet, and resource usage) involved in the                     transition from a foraging way of life to a settled agricultural                mode of existence.  In addition, the research will shed important               data on the stability and adaptiveness of a foraging mode of                    existence in the tropics which has recently become a contentious                topic in ecological anthropology with important implications for                our understanding of hominid evolution.",
