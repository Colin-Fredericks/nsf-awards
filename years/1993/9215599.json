 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given a set of design and process parameters, today's design               engineer is currently able to assess the quality and cost of the                final product through numerical simulation.  The parameters are                 used to create a finite element model of the manufacturing process              and the ensuing analysis is performed to evaluate the process                   response.  The engineer then studies the response to predict the                ultimate quality of the product.  Through some other means, the                 engineer also estimates the relative cost of the design versus                  other designs.  At this point, the engineer entertains the                      following questions:  (1) If the current design is not suitable,                how do I  improve it? (2) If the current design is suitable, how                might I improve it, or reduce its cost?  Presently, these questions             are resolved by the engineer's experience and/or trial and error.               Although a satisfactory design will ultimately be determined,                   there is no guarantee the chosen design is the most cost efficient,             i.e. optimal.  This research is to develop a systematic means to                obtain optimally designed manufactured products, concentrating on               the process of metal casting.  The approach combines the finite                 element method, numerical optimization, and recent advances in                  explicit  sensitivity analysis to investigate various means of                  quantifying the effects of varying casting parameters to obtain on              optimal casting.                                                                     Such a rational design method should allow the more efficient              and accurate design of molds for casting, resulting in lower                    casting cost and higher quality.",
