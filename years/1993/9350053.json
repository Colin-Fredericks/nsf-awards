The current Directory, published in                              1987, is outdated and lacks data on many                                        outstanding scientists and engineers with disabilities                          whom AAAS has identified since the publication of                               the last edition.  A number of individuals listed in                            the 2nd edition have new degrees or positions, and                              some are deceased.  A new edition is needed so that                             students with disabilities, teachers, administrators,                           counselors, families, program officers and                                      employers can network with working scientists and                               engineers with disabilities who can provide                                     knowledge and experience in eliminating barriers                                and successfully managing their education and entry                             into a science or engineering career.                                                                                                                           The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990                                     requires public facilities and programs to be made                              accessible to people with disabilities.  The                                    individuals who will be listed in the Resource                                  Directory are familiar with this law and, even                                  before its inception, were designing adaptations and                            providing technical assistance on accessibility                                 issues.  They will be available through the                                     Directory to assist others in restructuring their                               science and engineering environments.                                                                                                                           The products of this project will be three:  a print                            edition of the Resource Directory, an alternative                               format (disk) edition of the Resource Directory for                             people who are blind or print-impaired, and lists of                            scientists and engineers with disabilities in specific                          science disciplines on disk for use by NSF program                              officers in selecting peer reviewers and committee                              members.                                                                                                                                                        The revised edition will be cross-referenced by                                 scientific specialty, disability, location and gender                           and will list approximately 1,200 individuals.",
