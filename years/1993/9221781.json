 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental materials research is proposed with scanning probe                  microscopes:  1) crystal growth and etching will be observed in                 real-time as they occur at liquid-solid interfaces for detailed                 comparison with theoretical models, 2) the imaging of molecular                 crystals and other soft materials will be investigated and improved             by focusing on static and dynamic probe-surface interactions, and               3) the development of new scanning probe microscopes for materials              research will be continued with special emphasis on new techniques              for imaging ultra-fast processes.                                               %%%                                                                             Scanning probe microscopes, in particular the Atomic Force                      Microscope, are evolving into powerful tools for materials                      research.  They can image processes involved in the formation of                materials at unprecedented resolution.  They can image these                    processes as they occur in many cases.  Commercially available                  microscopes can already do many jobs in materials research and are              finding there way into more and more materials research                         laboratories.  This research is focused on pushing the frontiers                and developing new microscopes and new methodologies for handling               more and more problems and finding solutions that are impossible                with current instrumentation.  For example, the possibility of                  getting ultra-fast time resolution to study fast processes such as              magnetic domain wall motion will be explored.  As another example,              fundamental research on the imaging of soft materials is proposed.              Soft materials are hard to image for currently available                        microscopes because the tips can deform them.  Though much progress             has been made, more remains to be done.  Microscopes can now image              some soft surfaces but they have a hard time imaging polymers                   weakly attached to surfaces or processes involving aggregation of               polymer chains.  The long term goal is the creation of better                   materials as the result of fundamental studies done on the                      formation of materials with new microscopes and new ways to operate             those new microscopes.",
