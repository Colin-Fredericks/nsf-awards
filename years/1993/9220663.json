In                                                        particular, the control strategy is                                             aimed at deliberate releases from                                               man-made storage or process                                                     facilities that are deemed                                                      unavoidable because alternative                                                 actions may lead to more severe                                                 catastrophic results.  The                                                      procedure consists of combining                                                 two-dimensional transient models                                                that simulate the dynamics of the                                               release and its subsequent fate in                                              the environment and an adaptive                                                 control scheme, which monitors the                                              current state of the released                                                   matter and the ambient conditions.                                              Real-time feedback is sent to the                                               control mechanism, which in turn                                                develops an optimum release                                                     strategy that minimizes a                                                       predetermined performance index.                                                                                                                                The simulation models that are                                                  employed for the direct solution of                                             the release spreading have been                                                 repeatedly verified for their                                                   accuracy and reliability and                                                    standard optimization techniques                                                have shown that control of water                                                and toxic releases is possible.                                                 The novelty of the proposed                                                     research lies in an alternative                                                 formulation of the control problem                                              that avoids iterative simulations                                               of the direct problem, which, due                                               to lengthy computations, hinder the                                             real-time implementation of the                                                 procedure.  In contrast, by                                                     solution of the adjoint equation                                                for a variety of evolution problems                                             described by an enlarging and                                                   deforming domain, it is possible to                                             optimize a given performance index                                              without repeated simulations.  The                                              result is an efficient and                                                      practical procedure for unavoidable                                             hazardous releases that can                                                     minimize their environmental                                                    impact.",
