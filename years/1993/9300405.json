 "awd_abstract_narration": "Twelve students will participate in the Research Experiences for                Undergraduates program in microelectronic materials and                         processing at Purdue.  The Schools of Chemical, Electrical, and                 Materials Engineering, which have been sharing undergraduate                    courses as well as research on electronic materials and                         processing for several years, participate in this program.                      Students will be recruited from regional universities and                       universities with high minority enrollments for summer research                 projects.  Undergraduate students from Purdue will be able to                   perform summer or academic year research.  The focus of the REU                 site will be the synthesis, processing, properties, structure,                  and performance of microelectronic materials, and the                           interrelationships among these aspects.  Specific projects                      include anisotropic etching of microelectronic this films,                      selective epitaxial growth and insulator degradation, processing                on patterned substrates, fundamentals of metal contacts to                      semiconductors, and integration of oxide films with Si                          technologies.  The goals of the REU are to introduce students -                 with emphasis on women and minorities - to independent research                 on electronic materials and their processing, to develop and                    enhance the student's creativity and originality, to develop                    outstanding candidates for graduate programs, to demonstrate the                excitement and rewards from successful research, and to prepare                 B.S. graduates who will excel in industrial Research and                        Development environments.",
