During the tenure of this thirty-six month standard grant,  Professor Pesek and his colleagues at San Jose State University  (SJSU) will join with their counterpart staff scientists at the  IBM Almaden Research Center (IBM/ARC) to develop a unique  academic/industrial research and training program.  This  activity will bring together graduate students, undergraduate  students, small college faculty, and high school teachers to  participate in cooperative research projects which are  co-directed by SJSU and IBM/ARC scientists.  The focus of each  of the projects is the chemistry and characterization of  surfaces and materials.  Each of the participants will spend  time working in laboratories both at SJSU and IBM/ARC, thereby  enabling them to gain a perspective on academic as well as  industrial research and how cooperation can work to the benefit  of the two organizations.  %%%  Participants in this cooperative research activity are expected  to gain an enhanced appreciation of basic and applied research  which should encourage the students to continue on for advanced  degrees, the small college faculty to begin or more actively  pursue projects at their home institutions thereby sharing the  excitement of research and discovery with their students, and  the high school teachers to motivate more of their own students  to consider science as a career.  ***",
