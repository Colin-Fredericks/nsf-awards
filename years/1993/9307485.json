 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    9307485  Garrison    This award from the Chemistry  Research  Instrumentation  Program  will assist the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University  in the purchase of a Spectroscopic Facility for chemical research.  At  the heart of this facility are two argon ion laser-pumped tunable laser  systems and a triple monochrometer.  Included in the research to be  done with this equipment are:    1)  Effects of optical orientation on chemical equilibria and state  selective photodissociation,  2)  Time resolved fluorescence studies of the dynamics of solvation in  polar fluids,  3)  Resonance Raman studies of molecular association and of solvent effects  on electronic states,  4)  Near infrared surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) studies of  assemblies of colloidal monolayers of gold particles, and time-gated  surface-enhanced Resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) studies,  5)  Electron and energy transfer reactions at interfaces,  6)  Plasmon-enhanced surface Raman scattering of self-assembled  monolayers.    The requested instrumentation will satisfy a critical need that has  resulted from the addition of new faculty and from new research  developments within the Department of Chemistry.  %%%  A laser spectroscopic facility can provide important information  about molecular structure, molecular interactions and molecular dynamics  in solution and on surfaces.  This sort of information is necessary for a  basic understanding of chemical reactions.  ***",
