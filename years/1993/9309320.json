Object-oriented databases have been recognized as very useful for               advanced non-traditional applications such as design, planning,                 scheduling and geographic applications.  Recently a number of                   object-oriented data models have been developed. To facilitate                  easy querying in these disparate models, a number of visual query               languages have been proposed.  This project identifies the basic                constructs required for visual querying in object-oriented                      applications, and uses them to design and implement a generic                   visual query language.  This language extends gracefully from                   relational and nested models to disparate object-oriented models                (extendibility). It uses as few basic language constructs as                    necessary, while at the same time is versatile enough to encode                 specialized query-features of diverse object-oriented languages                 (few but powerful core language constructs). Furthermore, such                  encodings are user-friendly.  The generic language has strong                   theoretical foundations:  (1) enabling formal semantics, with                   proper consideration for safety, negation, etc., and a formal                   basis for measuring expressivity and complexity; and (2) proving                minimality of the constructs and showing how they simulate other                useful query-constructs, etc.  Such a generic language will                     provide a uniform front-end to users of diverse object-oriented                 models and applications, and will play an important role if                     developed as a server (analogous to SQL-servers) in a client-                   server environment.",
