This area of Mexico is among the most diverse botanically.  Seven volumes will be published by 1993 covering the conifers, ferns and monocotylodons and two large groups of dicotylodons; this renewal will treat a number of the remaining dicotylodon groups.  Although this flora has been issued in traditional treatments, the project has now begun to capture electronically the relevant collections in Mexican herbaria, so that in future the primary product will be an updatable floral database that will be used by researchers and land managers in various botanical studies and conservation measures.  Collaborators include Mexican herbaria, at which the collections will continue to be used to train students.

The project began in 1951 and the descriptive, illustrated flora is projected to be published in 17 volumes.

At the University of Michigan and at the collaborating Mexican herbaria the project's botanical collections are fundamental resources for training students and for research projects in maintaining and understanding this regional biodiversity.
