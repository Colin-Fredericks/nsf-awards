The National Science                Foundation's CISE Directorate has established a goal that 45% of                graduate students in CISE disciplines will be women by the year                 2000. The symposium, which is one of a number of activities being               recommended by CISE, is to be held on May 22nd. and 23rd., 1993 in              Washington, D.C. The students will be studying in CISE areas and                will be nominated by their institutions.                                                                                                                             The CRA is an association of U.S. and Canadian academic                    departments of Computer Science and Computer Engineering, and                   Industrial Laboratories engaging in basic computing research. The               mission of CRA is to represent and inform the computing research                community and to support and promote its interests. Dr. Weingarten              is the Executive Director of CRA.",
