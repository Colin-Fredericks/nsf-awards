The work addresses a single aspect of one of the most                   compelling questions challenging molecular biologists today, that               is, how the differentiation processes by which animals develop                  specialized organs from a single fertilized egg are regulated.  One             such process is that of muscle formation or myogenesis.  During                 myogenesis, myogenic cells turn on expression of numerous genes                 whose projects are specific to and necessary for function of                    muscle.  The turning on of muscle specific genes is accompanied by              down-regulation of expression of a family of genes which code for               proteins whose function appears to be to inhibit differentiation,               the Id or Inhibitor of differentiation proteins.  Id proteins are               not unique to muscle cells and one hypothesis is that Id inhibits               the differentiation of cells already commited to a specific                     developmental pathway until such time in embryogenesis as terminal              differentiation is appropriate.  In culture, when myoblasts or pre-             muscle cells are treated with the drug doxorubicin, and are then                placed in medium in which they would normally differentiate into                myotubes or muscle cells, they do not differentiate.  Instead, the              cells produce abnormally high levels of Id mRNA and protein, and                the genes which should be turned on during differentiation remain               off.  Genes are turned on and off by interactions between                       specialized regulatory proteins and specific DNA sequences in their             promoter or control regions.  These experiments are designed to                 determine and compare the sites of specific protein-DNA                         interactions in the promoter region of the Id gene in cells which               are expressing Id at different levels, myoblasts, myotubes, and                 muscle cells affected by exposure to doxorubicin.  \"In vivo                     footprinting\" will be used to determine where the regulatory                    proteins are bound.  The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region             will be determined, and the occupied sites will be compared to                  those already known to bind various tissue specific and ubiquitous              regulatory proteins.                                                                                                                                            In order for any biological developmental process to occur                      successfully, it must be carefully regulated.  Molecular biologists             have been successful at identifying a number of different                       regulatory proteins which control development.  One such protein is             called Id, and one of its functions appears to be to keep pre-                  muscle cells from becoming muscle tissue until exactly the right                time in development.  The results of this research will increase                our appreciation for the intricacies of development, and in so                  doing may provide insight into some developmental disorders or                  diseases which occur when molecular controls fail.",
