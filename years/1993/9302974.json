 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a 3-day meeting of 45 recent Ph.D.                     recipients and doctoral students in statistics and probability.                 The purpose of the meeting is to facilitate the exchange of                     research ideas among new researchers in diverse areas of                        statistics and probability and to assist in the professional                    development of new researchers.  Those attending will actively                  participate in the program by either presenting their research in               a short talk or in a poster.  The program also include overview                 talks on cutting-edge research and a panel discussion on how to                 initiate an active research program, where senior researchers                   will have an opportunity to shape the research potential of these               new members of the mathematics community.   The conference is to                be held prior to the joint annual meeting of the IMS and American               Statistical Association (ASA) in August, 1993.  Conference                      attendees will be encouraged to participate in workshops held on                writing skills, the professional development of new women                       researchers, and special topic workshops in probability and                     genetics held the weekend between this conference and the annual                meetings of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.",
