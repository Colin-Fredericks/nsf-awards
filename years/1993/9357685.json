By effectively  combining the programmability of computers with the pervasiveness  of mass-market information networks, these advances promise to  herald a new epoch in media communication.  In this research, we  focus on the following areas arising out of the synergies between  computing and media communication:  (1) Multimedia on-demand  information servers that can support a wide variety of services,  ranging from video on-demand for home entertainment to distance  learning and digital libraries for education; (2) Media  synchronization techniques, communication architectures and  admission control strategies for supporting high-performance  multimedia applications efficiently over future integrated  networks; and (3) Emerging paradigms and software architectures  for structured multimedia tele-collaborations.  For designing  interactive multimedia on-demand information services, we are  developing a constrained block allocation model that guarantees  continuous media retrieval, and algorithms to service an optimal  number of user simultaneously without violating the real-time  retrieval, rates of any of the users.  Multimedia services  generally involve playback of multiple media strands  (continuously recorded video frames of audio samples) over high-  speed networks onto user display sites (e.g., HDTVs).  We propose  to develop adaptive, rate-based techniques for synchronous  playback of multimedia strands at display sites over networks.   In high-performance multimedia applications (e.g., Tele-  orchestra), media data form all the user must be continuously  mixed together and displayed synchronously.  We are proposing  optimal hierarchical mixing architectures for supporting scalable  tele-collaborations and conferences with minimum real time end-  to-end delays and are developing a Packet train protocol in which  routing nodes themselves of a network can b e used as mixers,  thereby integrating mixing with routing in networks such as the  Internet.  We expect to experimentally demonstrate these ideas at  the Multimedia Laboratory at UCSD.  Our experience will prove  valuable in designing multimedia services for future integrated  networks in this rapidly approaching age of tele-personal  interaction.",
