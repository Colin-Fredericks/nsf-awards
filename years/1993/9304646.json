 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtubules are intracellular polymers that participate in a                 variety of events in eukaryotic cells, including mitosis,                       intracellular particle transport and the maintenance of asymmetric              cell shape.  Microtubules are inherently dynamic, and are observed              to alternate between periods of growth and rapid shortening.   The              transition from growth to rapid shortening is termed catastrophe;               the reverse transition, rescue.  To directly observe the dynamic                behavior of microtubules in living cells, a fluorescent analog of               tubulin, the subunit protein of the microtubule, will be injected               into cells and allowed to incorporate into the microtubule polymer.             The fluorescent microtubules will be detected using low-light-level             fluorescence microscopy.  The rates of microtubule growth and                   shortening and the frequencies of transitions between these two                 states will be quantified from video records of the living cells.               The dynamic behavior of microtubules will be determined as cells                progress through the cell cycle.  Previously characterized                      molecules which bind microtubules will be injected into living                  cells and the resulting behavior of the microtubules measured.  The             parameters of microtubule dynamics in epithelial cells will be                  determined and factors which promote microtubule rescue events will             be isolated from these cells.  A wound model will be used to induce             the reorientation and motility of fibroblasts.  Under these                     conditions, a new lamella is extended; the formation of stable,                 paused microtubules and the contribution of microtubules to the                 formation of focal contacts in the newly formed lamella will be                 measured.  The results of these experiments will provide new                    information concerning the mechanisms that cells utilize to modify              and regulate the dynamic behavior of microtubules during these                  various events.  Finally, using cell fractionation and functional               assays for microtubule behavior, the regulatory factors which                   modulate microtubule behavior will be characterized.                            %%%                                                                             Microtubules are ubiquitous in the eukaryotic world and fundamental             to life as we know it.  They are scaffolding for cell shape, road               maps for intracellular motility, and determinants of post-cleavage              cell fate; they form the mitotic spindle apparatus which is                     responsible for chromosome segregation to daughter cells, and they              are the stuff of cilia and flagella, responsible for cellular                   locomotion. Microtubules are polymeric cytoskeletal structures made             up of the protein tubulin.  In most situations, the polymers are                dynamic, that is, they are continuously undergoing polymerization               and depolymerization.  Understanding their dynamic behavior and the             molecular basis for this dynamism are important goals for                       understanding microtubule functions in nature, as well as for                   harnessing microtubules either directly or indirectly for                       nonbiological practical applications e.g., molecular switches).",
