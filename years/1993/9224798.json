 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with problems related to                        statistical inference in nonlinear time series, state-space                     models, random fields and spatial point processes.  The emphasis                will be on nonlinear and non-Gaussian models.  A unified approach               will be used to study the asymptotic efficiency properties of the               estimators and tests.  The local asymptotic normality will be                   investigated for the  likelihood-based models.  the quasi-                      likelihood framework will be used for the cases where the                       likelihood function is unavailable.  Empirical Bayes methods will               also be investigated.                                                                The statistical analysis and the models to be studied in                   this proposal will have an impact on a large number of diverse                  applications in Basic Sciences, Engineering, Health Sciences,                   Economic and Social Planning, among other.  Statistical data such               as the unemployment figures, various economic indicators, stock                 market fluctuations, opinion polls, currency exchange rates and                 the like are all subject to inherent random variations, and                     possibly trends.  These aspects involving uncertainty can                       usefully be represented by appropriate probability models such as               the ones proposed here.  Various methods of forecasting and                     assessing the precision of the forecasts will also be studied.                  Techniques of statistical estimation and methods of testing the                 validity of the models proposed will be investigated.",
