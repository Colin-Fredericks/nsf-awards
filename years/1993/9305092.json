This  response involves the action of two regulatory proteins: LexA,  which represses about 20 SOS genes during normal growth, and RecA,  which is activated by inducing treatments to a form that catalyzes  the specific cleavage of LexA repressor, inactivating it and  leading to induction of the SOS genes.  Hence, specific cleavage  plays a crucial role in the SOS response.  In addition to this  central regulatory role of LexA cleavage, this reaction is of  considerable biochemical interest. Its mechanism is unusual, in  that LeA cleaves itself in an intramolecular reaction termed  autodigestion, and activated RecA acts to stimulate LexA  self-cleavage under physiological conditions.  In these conditions,  LexA cleavage is designed to proceed slowly, but at the same time  to be capable of large rate increases.  This view raises two  related questions: What is the mechanism of LexA autodigestion, and  how can RecA protein facilitate this reaction? Three complementary  approaches are proposed to address these questions.  The first is  to continue to isolate and characterize mutations that influence  the rate of LexA cleavage.  The second approach is to continue to  develop the bimolecular LexA cleavage reaction, in which one  molecule of LexA or lambda repressor acts as an enzyme to cleave  other molecules of LexA.  The third approach is to look for  physical evidence that LexA can exist in two different  conformational states.     %%%  An increasingly large number of biologically important reactions  are being discovered that are intramolecular.  These include self-  splicing RNA introns, autophosphorylation and autophosphatase  activity of chemotaxis proteins, and autophosphorylation of  oncogene proteins, growth factor receptors, and other important  proteins. The proposed work is of general signifi cance for the  insights it is expected to yield regarding the properties of  intramolecular self-processing reactions, and the means by which  the rated of these reactions can be regulated by interactions with  other effector molecules.  ***",
