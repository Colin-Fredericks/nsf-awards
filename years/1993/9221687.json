 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported in the Analytical and Surface                  Chemistry Program, continues studies of the infrared                            spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces.  Detailed                 reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopic studies of methyl                  thiolate, methoxy, and ethylidyne moieties adsorbed on                          silver,copper, and rhodium surfaces will be carried out.  All                   of these systems exhibit Fermi resonance effects which couple                   the symmetric C-H stretch fundamental with methyl bending                       overtones, and serve as excellent models of the important                       physical interactions between adsorbate molecules and between                   the adsorbate and the surface.  The quantitative understanding                  developed in this work will have wide applicablility in the use                 of infrared spectroscopy to study surface chemistry.                            %%%                                                                             The widespread use of infrared spectroscopy to study the                        mechanisms of surface chemical processes is a method                            development which has provided an increased understanding of a                  number of important heterogeneous systems.  The goal of this                    research project is to develop the detailed knowledge of the                    infrared spectroscopy of molecules adsorbed at surfaces which                   will enable the continued use of infrared to monitor surface                    reactions.  High resolution IR methods provide a wealth of                      information, and the results of this research project will be                   essential to the development and implementation of these                        methods.",
