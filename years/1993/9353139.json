 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, The Underrepresentation of Minority Women in             Science and Engineering Education, is the outgrowth of information              that only 3 percent of the doctorates awarded to U.S. citizens in               science and engineering were awarded to American Indian, Black, and             Hispanic women.  The study proposes to identify and clarify the                 relationship between race/ethnicity, gender, and educational                    outcomes by comparing the educational outcomes of non-Asian                     minority women with majority women in science and engineering.  Two             hypothesis predicts disadvantages for women based on the double                 oppression that comes from joint membership in the two lower status             groups.  It is expected that the research findings will have                    both practical and policy implications for minority women in S/E                graduate education.",
