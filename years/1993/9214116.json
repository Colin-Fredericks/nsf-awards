 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate   highly parallel  preconditioning techniques for solving general large sparse  linear systems of equations.  Of particular interest are   systems that arise from the discretization of partial  differential equations on unstructured grids.  The   focuses on efficient preconditioners which scale well when   number of processors is very large.  In this situation, the  standard incomplete factorization preconditioners are not  satisfactory.  The project investigates a number of  non-standard alternatives which emphasize approximations   based on  ``high level of accuracy.''  These are similar to ILU  factorizations with high level of fill-in.  Many of the   parallel preconditioners, suffer from the disadvantage that   entail a larger number of iterations than standard  preconditioners to achieve convergence.  This often outweighs   potential gains arising from the higher degree of   parallelism.  However, recent experience suggests that increasing the   of the preconditioner is a good strategy for achieving faster  execution by reducing the number of iterations.  The use of   multi-coloring techniques is also investigated.",
