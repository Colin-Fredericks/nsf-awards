These processes are chemical at the electron               transfer step, but can be mediated by biological processes.                                                                                                          In salt marshes where dissolved Fe concentrations reach mM                 levels, pyrite oxidation can be mediated by Fe (III) organic                    complexes because of the rapid cycling of dissolved Fe.  The main               reactions of the iron cycle are (1) solubilization of Fe(III) by                organic ligands, (2) reduction of soluble Fe(III) to Fe(II) by                  these ligands, soluble reduced sulfur or pyrite, (3) the oxidation              of the resulting Fe(II) (complexed to organic chelates) by Fe(III)              minerals releasing more dissolved Fe(III), and (4) the formation of             iron sulfide minerals when dissolved sulfide is in excess. This                 cycle of iron solubilization will continue as long as bacteria                  and/or plants produce organic ligands.  This study will investigate             the reaction of sulfide with soluble Fe(III) and Mn(III) complexes              and develop a method for the determination of dissolved Mn(III) in              anoxic waters.  These complexes should exist even as catalytic                  intermediates in organic rich anoxic waters. They are easily                    prepared based on methods in the chemical literature. //",
