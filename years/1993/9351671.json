This laboratory facility is enabling  us to teach computational chemistry and visualization  applications to students in a laboratory environment as well as  providing lecture demonstration capabilities through our video  classroom facilities.  This integrated use of molecular  modeling and visualization tools is being implemented  throughout our curriculum (and especially in the junior and  senior years) and is enabling our students to visualize a  number of fundamental molecular properties which are important  in relating microscopic concepts to the macroscopic properties  of materials.  Recent advances in computational chemistry  programs, 3D visualization software, workstation power and  computer networking have combined to allow this exciting  opportunity to make fundamental pedagogical changes in the  undergraduate curriculum.  These changes are enabling students  to better understand and comprehend the critical, basic  concepts of molecular bonding, intramolecular and  intermolecular interactions, and molecular interactions with  electromagnetic radiation.  Perhaps most importantly, the  students are gaining that understanding much earlier in their  chemical education which, in turn, is permitting them to  advance to much higher levels of chemical understanding during  their undergraduate education.  ***",
