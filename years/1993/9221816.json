 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Bulgaria Research award is to Dr. Martin Hertzberg of                 the American University in Bulgaria, to work with the U.S. Bureau               of Mines, in cooperation (on the Bulgarian side) the Bulgarian                  Academy of Sciences, the University of Mining and Geology, and                  the Mining Research and Technology, and the Mining Research and                 Technology Institute, to work on \"Combustion Experiments and                    Numerical Modelling of Dust Explosions and Spontaneous                          Self-Heatings.\"  The researchers will perform experimental                      studies of the explosability of dusts and the spontaneous                       self-heating of coals, complemented by theoretical numerical                    modelling of those combustion processes.  The combustion of                     phase-heterogeneous systems plays a critical role in modern                     technology.  The objective of the explosability part of this                    research program is to study the fundamental physical processes                 responsible for the existence of flammability limits.  The need                 to solve the problem of spontaneous combustion of low rank coals                presenting severe hazards in underground Bulgarian mines provides               a strong incentive to reevaluate the fundamentals of the                        spontaneous ignition process formulated in the classical theory                 of Semenov and Frank-Kamenetskii, which theory requires                         substantial modifications in order to include the processes of                  natural convection and gas transport into (and out of) the                      self-heating mass.  In addition, the exothermic/endothermic                     moisture transport process must be added to the exothermic                      surface oxidation rate of coals, and the numerical modelling of                 those processes must be three-dimensional.                                                                                                                      This project in combustion research fulfills the program                        objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling leading                 experts in the United States and Eastern Europe to combine                      complementary talents and pool resources in areas of strong                     mutual interest and competence.",
