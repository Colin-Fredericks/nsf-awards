 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent interest in areas such as thin-film magnetics and high              temperature superconductivity have underscored the need for                     detailed measurements of Fermi surfaces. This proposal addresses                the problem by using a newly developed technique using                          photoelectron spectroscopy to determine Fermi surfaces. The                     technique is generally applicable to a wide range of materials and              will provide information on both bulk and surface systems. It is                sensitive to the structure of the Fermi surface in regions of low               symmetry and studies can be performed at elevated temperatures                  where phase transitions may be important.                                            Measurements will be made using a novel display-type electron              energy analyzer that will produce energy resolved two dimensional               images of photoemission intensity versus emission angle. The work               will be conducted at the LSU Center for Advanced Microstructure and             Devices (CAMD) synchrotron light source. The initial investigations             will involve noble metals which are well-understood from previous               studies and will later be extended to metals with heavily nested                Fermi surfaces. Some of these materials undergo magnetic phase                  transitions where the topology of the Fermi surface can change                  substantially; such experiments will support further theoretical                progress. These techniques will also be applied to high temperature             superconductors where the nature of the bands intercepting the                  Fermi surface will be investigated. Since the method samples large              regions of k-space, these materials will be surveyed for unexpected             features and will provide the rapid overviews of electronic                     structure. Conventional instrumentation will be used for high-                  resolution studies when appropriate. The work will be done in                   collaboration with researchers at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory,                the National Institute of Standards and Technology at other                     universities.                                                                   %%%                                                                                  As new classes of materials are developed, techniques for                  characterizing their relevant properties must improve. This need                will be addressed in the development of a new display-type electron             energy analyzer, to perform photoelectron spectroscopy in an                    imaging mode. The measurements rely on synchrotron radiation to                 eject electrons from surfaces of the material of interest; this                 radiation will be provided by the LSU Center for Advanced                       Microstructure and Devices (CAMD) storage ring. By imaging the                  directions of the emission, the detailed nature of the material's               Fermi surface can be explored. This provides information that is                valuable for a theoretical understanding  of material behavior and              gives feedback for improvements in materials processing.                             Initially, the method will be applied to metallic systems that             are well understood by other techniques. The approach will refined              to study materials with more complicated Fermi surfaces that can be             altered by coercing them to undergo magnetic phase transitions and              will be used to demonstrate the flexibility of the methodology.                 Finally, this advanced instrumentation will be applied to high                  temperature superconductors as the origin of superconductivity in               the cuprate oxides remains elusive. The project provides a new                  method for characterizing the electronic states at the Fermi                    surface and will result in an improved understanding of fundamental             electronic properties. As the measurements rely on the highest                  quality materials, collaboration with researchers at the Lawrence               Livermore Laboratory, the National Institute of Standards, and at               other universities will be undertaken.//",
