 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317705  Bader  This project proposes expanding Internet access from the main  academic campus of The George Washington University to the entire  George Washington University Medical Center (GWUMC) including its  affiliated faculty at primary care sites throughout the greater  Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.  GWUMC is committed to the  education of the generalist physician and through this project,  which will connect the computer network at the Medical Center to  Internet, can offer universal access to all members of the Medical  Center's extended constituency, those working at the academic hub  as well as those in the more remote primary care sites.  The  connection will enhance communication and collaboration between  physicians, researchers, librarians, students, and staff at GWUMC  and their colleagues around the world.  Students will learn that  service in a primary care setting does not mean isolation from  colleagues, access to information and the latest advances in  medical practice.  The Internet will be demonstrated as a bond  which can balance the scales between academicians at universities,  major teaching hospitals , and research centers with their  counterparts in community hospitals, urban or rural clinics, and  the solo practitioner's office.  The Medical Center as part of its information management strategic  plan is installing an FDDI network named MedNet, which will  integrate the hospital and faculty practice plan information  management systems, the academic computing system (including  library, bibliographic and clinical information systems), and all  departmental LANs.  Current access to the Internet for the Medical  Center is limited to dial-access to the University computing center  for researchers, physicians, and students based at the School of  Medicine and Health Sciences.  This project will establish desktop  connectivity with the Internet for all faculty, staff and students,  including connected to the GWUMC network (MedNet) from all on and  off-campus locatio ns with the Internet by installing FDDI cards  which will link its routers to the George Washington University's  fibreoptic network (GWIN) and its Internet gateway.",
