It is                  focused on the relation between stress, cortisol release (a                     physiological indicator of stress), and measures of behavioral                  distress in infants and toddlers.  It involves a longitudinal                   study between birth and 18 months of age.  Adrenocortical and                   behavioral stress responses will be assess for PKU screening at                 birth and routine inoculation at 6 and 18 months if age.                        Maternal caregiving practices and family stress will be assessed                when infants are 3 months of age.  Quality of mother-infant                     attachment as well as infant visual self-recognition, self-                     conscious emotion, and health will be assessed when infants are                 18 months of age.  The research will inform us not only about                   infant reactivity to stress using both behavioral and                           adrenocortical responses, but also the impact of the mother-                    infant relationship in infant stress reactivity as well as the                  impact of both infant stress reactivity and he mother-infant                    relationship in early infancy on subsequent outcomes in the                     domains of infant health and socioemotional functioning.  This                  information is important both theoretically and practically, and                will enrich our understanding of fundamental developmental                      processes in infancy.",
