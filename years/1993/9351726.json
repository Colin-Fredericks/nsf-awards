 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351726  Xiao  Recent advances in the field of optics should be reflected in  undergraduate science and engineering programs.  This is  presently accomplished at the University of Arkansas by  offering to students in science and engineering a series of  three courses: \"Optics\", \"Laser Physics\", and \"Applied Non-  Linear Optics\".  In \"Optics\" students develop a foundation of  both physical and wave optics, in \"Laser Physics\" students  develop specific skills in design, construction, and analysis  of different laser systems, while in \"Applied Non-Linear  Optics\" they utilize their skills to investigate concepts and  techniques that are finding widespread applications in science  and engineering.  The present program at Arkansas supports the  \"Optics\", \"Laser Physics\" and \"Applied Non-Linear Optics\"  courses by providing a strong laboratory experience.  The basic  project plan reinforces the interest and enthusiasm which is  piqued in the lecture and to give students the opportunity to  continue to develop their talents and their interests into  specific skills. The new laboratory program uses non-linear  optical materials as a vehicle to develop skills in (i)  Electro-, Magneto-, and Acousto-Optics; (ii) Optical Wave  Mixing; (iii) Photorefractive Phenomena; and (iv) Guided Waves  and Integrated Optics. In every case the equipment requested is  of the type which students encounter in research and  development laboratories engaged in optics related work.",
