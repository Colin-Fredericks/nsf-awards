 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will provide the research foundation for the creation               of a graphical-reasoning-congruent interface and task-table-based               experiment-generator software system that enhances the reasoning                processes of behavioral researchers in the creation, running, and               analyses of behavioral research.  The major projects will determine             the operators and functions utilized in computerized experiments                published in the major cognitive and psychological journals in                  1992;  implement a research prototype Graphical Experiment                      Specification Interface (GESI);  evaluate the reasoning of                      behavioral science researchers working with and without the GESI                system;  and create and assess the precision of hardware and                    software methods to evaluate critical screen timing and display                 luminance.  Later phases of this project could improve behavioral               research methodology in as many as a thousand university and                    commercial laboratories within three years and allow the US to take             a world leadership position in distributing behavioral research                 software for experiment generation.  The research will identify                 reasoning support tools to advance scientific problem solving that              may be transferred to other disciplines and commercial graphical                user interfaces.  It will enhance graphical user interface                      technology to provide problem solving and reasoning aids.",
