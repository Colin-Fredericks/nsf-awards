A special focus of  the research program is emphasis on refining surface-sensitive  spectroscopic measurements to derive structure, bonding, and  reactivity information from macromolecular surfaces.  In  particular, model systems are constructed by Langmuir-Blodgett (LB)  techniques to determine the qualitative and quantitative  capabilities, and sampling depths of Secondary Ion Mass  Spectrometry (SIMS), High Resolution Electron Energy Loss  Spectrometry (HREELS), and angle and energy dependant Electron  Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA or X-Ray Photoelectron  Spectroscopy, XPS).  Results from SIMS, ESCA and infrared  spectroscopic methods are combined with surface energetics, thermal  analysis, electron microscopy, and other more established methods  in addressing three general problems in polymer surface science.   One focus is to provide quantitative descriptions of the surface  reactivity of thin molecular, monomer, and polymer films prepared  by LB and \"self-assembly\" methods.  A second group of projects aims  to describe the near-surface composition and structure of selected  multicomponent and multiphase polymers, especially those which are  phase separated.  Emphasis is placed on determining the effects of  preparation and evaluating the composition as a function of depth.   The third area of investigation involves surface chemical  modification of fluoropolymers using both low-wattage plasmas and  chemical reactions.  The studies for the next three-year period  build on the previous work, and the new research program will  emphasize the use of quantitative SIMS methods study interfacial  polymer chemistry.    This research aims to develop quantitative methods of measuring the  composition of polymer surfaces.  This type of information in  essential for an understanding of such applications as adhesion and  biocompatibility.  ***",
