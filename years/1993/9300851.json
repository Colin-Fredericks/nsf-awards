It is a study of urban agriculture              in Kampala, Uganda, examining this form of farming as an adaptive               response to the economic crisis which besets much of Africa.  With              a diverse set of research methodologies, this project will collect              and analyze dietary and nutritional anthropometry data, land access             and tenure data as well as socio-economic and agricultural data.                Theoretical analysis will focus on the reasons for urban                        agriculture, the constraints on this practice, and the impacts on               individual well-being and on the household.                                                                                                                          This study promises to collect information of significant                  value for African urban policy, and it will contribute to the                   sociological understanding of human adaptations to social and                   economic crisis.  In addition to the scientific gains to be                     achieved by the research, this award will materially assist a                   highly promising student in completing research for the Ph.D.                   dissertation.  Thus it contributes to the future scientific                     manpower of the nation and the thorough training of the next                    generation of sociologists.",
