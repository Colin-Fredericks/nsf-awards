 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research explores the physico-                          chemical means by which sediments deposited at the earth's                      surface become lithified during burial.  Solution-transfer                      creep is a possible mechanism, but the kinematics are not                       well defined.  Experiments at Texas A&M University will                         monitor rates of pore-volume loss and water-rock interaction                    in sand-water mixtures under hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic                     conditions as a function of temperature, confining pressure,                    fluid pressure, grain size, clay content and aggregate                          volume strain.  These will be performed in reactively inert                     pressure vessels that simulate temperature and pressure                         conditions typical of diagenesis.  Experiments at University                    of Oklahoma will be conducted in a similar vessel, but with                     the added capabilities of triaxial loading and constant                         fluid flow.  This effort will study compaction as a function                    of applied differential stress, study stress-related sand-                      water reaction kinetics, long-term constant flow conditions,                    and effects of solution undersaturation on compaction rates.                    data sets for both institutions will be interpreted in terms                    of constitutive \"creep\" laws for time-dependent volume                          strain, and together with reaction rate laws of mineral-                        water interaction under nonhydrostatic conditions (also                         experimentally determined), will be extrapolated to                             geological scenarios using numerical methods.  The aim of                       this research is ultimately to quantify rates of pore-volume                    loss in sandstones during burial and to understand the                          thermodynamics kinetics of water-rock interaction under                         hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic conditions.",
