 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Career Advancement Award (CAA) to Professor Grassian is                    for the investigation of fundamental photochemical reactions of                 molecules adsorbed on single-crystal metal surfaces.  Pulsed                    laser, time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry and infrared                      spectrophotometry will be used to analyze the products from                     photodecomposition and photodesorption reactions occuring on                    the surface of metal particles.  In addition, the TOF                           instrumentation will allow the measurement of the angular and                   translational energy distributions of the proposed                              photooxidation and photohydrogenation reactions.  The goal is                   to improve our understanding of photo-induced chemical                          reactions which occur on the surface of metal catalysts.                        %%%                                                                             Career Advancement Awards allow female investigators to                         initiate research programs in new or innovative areas of                        investigation.  Professor Grassian will use this CAA to expand                  her research into the area of photochemistry on the surface of                  single-crystal metal particles.  The results will provide                       increased knowledge concerning photo-induced chemical reactions                 observed on catalytic surfaces.",
