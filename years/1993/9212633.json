 "awd_abstract_narration": "9212633  Crain    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Richard  C. Crain, Department of Molecular and Cell  Biology, University of Connecticut, to pursue  with Dr. Youngsook Lee, Department of Life  Science, Pohang Institute of Science and  Technology, for 24 months, a program of  cooperative research on the role of lipid  metabolism in light-mediated circadian rhythms  in plants.  Changes in lipid metabolism that  they hypothesize are involved in mediating  light-induced opening of stomata - microscopic  pores at the surface of leaves - will be the  central focus of their research.  Plant cells respond to many of the same  environmental signals as animal cells,  including light, stress, and gravity, as well  as internal hormonal and cell-cell contact  signals.  In animal cells, the biochemical  mechanisms coupling environmental signals to  ultimate responses, in many cases, have been  carefully analyzed, and many receptors,  enzymes, and second messengers have been  identified and characterized.  In plants,  however, the understanding of such pathways is  far from complete.  The U.S. and Korean  collaborators are highly respected scientists  with proven ability in the field of this  research.  Dr. Crain's laboratory has  experience with the biochemical methods for  extraction, separation, and quantification of  the lipids and their metabolites.  Dr. Lee has  experience in the isolation of light-responsive  guard cell protoplasts and the measurement of  stomatal apertures.  Experimental methods to  achieve their specific objectives will take  advantage of the research expertise of both  collaborating laboratories.  This project is  relevant to the objectives of the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to  increase the level of cooperation between U.S.  and Korean scientists and engineers through the  exchange of scientific information, ideas,  skills, and techniques and through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.   Korean participation in the project is  supported by  the Korea Science and Engineering  Foundation (KOSEF).  This project adds an  international cooperative dimension to the PI's  research under NSF Grant No. DCB-9206179.  ***",
