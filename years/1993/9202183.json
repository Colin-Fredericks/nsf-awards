 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems computerized Database is                designed to allow broad-scale comparisons of the paleobiology and               paleoecology of terrestrial ecosystems and their plant and animal               communities.  In particular, research interest in this project                  focuses on making detailed comparisons on a locality-by-locality                basis of paleocommunity structure, paleovegetation, and                         paleoenvironments, and on tracing patterns in biological                        structural change in terrestrial ecosystems throughout geologic                 time.  Such studies require the synthesis of large amounts of                   information currently scattered throughout a vast literature or                 lying unpublished in museum collections, and are difficult to                   undertake using the available information resources within                      paleontology.  The current award will support the purchase of new               hardware and modifications in existing software.  The specific                  goal is to migrate the project to a more standard version of UNIX               running on a modern, high-performance workstation and to re-write               the Graphical User Interface to be compatible with X Windows                    standards.  This will immediately allow increased performance and               functionality at sites were the database is currently being                     compiled and used (the Smithsonian and UCSB).  It will also allow               access to the database by multiple users on a wide variety of                   remote computers.",
