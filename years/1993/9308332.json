The  proposed work uses the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) as a  nondestructive characterization tool for thin film and  graded refractive index transparent materials.  The limits  of sensitivity of the measuring techniques will be  investigated.  The absolute accuracy of the measured film  refractive index will be calculated as a function of the  measured film thickness and the refractive index contrast  between the coating and the substrate.  Quantitative  correlations between film deposition conditions and the film  qualities will be made.  It can have the effect of  facilitating the production of homogeneous and high-quality  films.  %%%  This proposed work uses the spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE)  as a nondestructive characterization tool for thin film and  graded refractive index transparent materials.  It plans to  examine the limits of sensitivity of the measurements, and  it seeks to separate the effect of microstructural  inhomogeneities in the films from the actual optical  properties of the material.   Transparent films are  important in this age  of optical communications. This study provides quantitative  measures in how to improve the qualities of the films. Its'  potentials to improve the optical communication application  are very great.  ***",
