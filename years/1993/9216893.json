 "awd_abstract_narration": "This continuing grant supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in astronomy between Kevin Prendergast of Columbia University and               Evangelie Athanassoula of the Marseille Observatory.  The                       objective of their research is to develop numerical simulations                 of the formation and evolution of galaxies using a three-fluid                  model for the stars, the gas and dark matter. Star formation,                   mass loss, wind and supernova heating, and radiative cooling of                 gas are included in their numerical code.  The investigators                    propose to continue their research on dwarf ellipticals and to                  extend the numerical code to spiral and giant elliptical                        galaxies.  The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration his               expertise in numerical simulations.  This is complemented by the                French investigator's experience in coding, debugging and                       production.  The project takes advantages of French facilities,                 which include Cray, Sun, Vax and Microvax computers, and utilizes               French software for running these programs.                                                                                                                     This research project will advance understanding of the formation               of galaxies and the structure of the universe. The proposed                     numerical techniques are unique and may be used for other                       problems in astrophysics.",
