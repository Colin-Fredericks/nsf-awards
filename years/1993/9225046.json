 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Rodger to work               in combinatorics.  Professor Rodger will continue his                           investigations into the area of graph decompositions and                        embeddings of partial graph-designs.  Professor Rodger will also                continue his development of a natural generalization of latin                   squares, which he has called patterned holes.  This concept of                  patterned holes has led to dramatic improvements in embeddings of               various partial graph designs and has led to generalizations of                 several classical embedding theorems.                                                The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                      Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                   discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete                systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                   example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                 and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                  discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.",
