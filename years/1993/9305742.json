 "awd_abstract_narration": "Postdoctoral funding through this award provides support for               mathematical research on problems concerning boundary values of                 quasiconformal mappings and weighted Sobolev inequalities                       associated with quasiregular mappings.  The problems addressed in               the project contribute to the understanding of the interplay                    between analytic and geometric aspects in the analysis of these                 mappings.  By quasiconformal mappings one understands univalent                 mappings between Euclidean spaces of the same dimension in which                the distortion or dilatation of the mapping is bounded.                         Quasiregular mappings satisfy the same conditions but are not                   required to be univalent.  Both reflect a natural outgrowth of                  the study of analytic functions of a complex variable.  Work                    will be done examining the derivative of quasiconformal mappings.               It had been thought that these functions always had powers which                were locally integrable.  This is not the case.  However, a                     recently advanced notion of average derivative suggests that it                 is this function which will ultimately have the right power                     integrals (for conformal maps this average and conventional                     derivatives agree).  Also to be examined are the radial boundary                values of average derivatives in terms of the distance to the                   boundary.  Other work focuses on changes in elliptic equations                  when composed with quasiconformal and quasiregular maps and on                  Sobolev mappings with integrable dilatation.  In the latter, the                fundamental question is one of showing that if powers of a                      derivative of an arbitrary map are bounded by the Jacobian times                a bounded function then the mapping is open and discrete.  The                  results has been validated in the two-dimensional case.",
