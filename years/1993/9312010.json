 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. John Harris, Mr. Michael Rogers will                 collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct                     archaeological survey and excavation in the region East of Lake                 Turkana in Kenya. He will focus his attention on a geological                   stratum known as the Okote Member and which dates to ca. 1.64-1.39              million years ago. Previous work has recovered both stone tools and             associated faunal remains and thus demonstrated that this region                was inhabited by early hominids. However little is known about the              behavior of these early humans. Through a study both of the                     distribution of different kinds of lithic remains over space and of             their association with faunal remains and each other, Mr. Rogers                should gain insight into how activities were spaced over the                    landscape.                                                                                                                                                      This research is important for several reasons. First, it will                  increase our understanding of the emergence of modern humans. It is             clear that behavior, and behavioral changes have played a major                 role in the development of our species yet for the earlier stages               of this process, relatively little is known. Mr. Rogers' research               will help to fill this gap. Secondly, this research will help to                develop and refine techniques of archaeological analysis. The                   methods Mr. Rogers will use may be applicable in many time periods              and many regions of the world. Finally this grant will help to                  train an extremely promising young scientist.",
