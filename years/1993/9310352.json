 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310352  Propper    Angiotensin II is a peptide antidiuretic hormone involved in  maintaining water balance by acting both on peripheral targets to  enhance water uptake across tissues and on the central nervous  system to induce drinking behavior.  Since water is essential for  survival, understanding how this hormone enhances water-absorption  is of utmost importance.  The mechanism, however, by which  angiotensin II acts in the brain is not well understood.  While  most vertebrates have a regular and predictable water supply,  desert animals live in harsh conditions in which survival is  dependent upon the ability to find, obtain and conserve water.   These species have evolved mechanisms of water retention which  allows them to survive under these uncharitable conditions.  Dr.  Propper has selected two species that differ in genetic background  but live within the same austere environment.  She will employ a  combination of behavioral, neuroanatomical and endocrine techniques  to determine the underlying mechanisms of Angiotensin 11 action.    Dr. Propper will determine whether centrally administering this  peptide induces water absorption behavior, and whether the behavior  is blocked by antagonists to the receptor.  Moreover, Dr. Propper  will localize and characterize these angiotensin II receptors in  the brain.  Finally, she will determine the effects that  dehydration has on central and peripheral receptor concentrations  and correlate these changes with behavior in the natural  environment.  The results from this integrative work will provide  new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying angiotensin  action.  Furthermore, since Dr. Propper is comparing species that  differ in their genetic background, she will discover whether  similar neuroendocrine mechanisms are employed to manage water  balance in vertebrates in general.  These findings may lead to a  better understanding of how the neuroendocrine basis of adaptive  behavior has evolved.   ***",
