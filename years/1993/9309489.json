 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chaudhary         This project explores a new scheme for achieving load  balancing in a heterogeneous distributed computing system.  With  the advent of optical links it is now feasible to migrate tasks  from one computer to a remote computer.  This scheme is being  implemented and tested using real-world problems in a real  heterogeneous distributed computing environment.  A salient  feature of the scheme is its semi-distributed, adaptive nature,  i.e., the parameters taken into consideration and the algorithm  for load balancing itself change during run time.  The algorithm  is stable, i.e., no processes are allowed to migrate without  making any progress.  No assumptions are made about the  dependency relations of the various tasks.  Various job classes  with precedence constraints are allowed.  Other important real-  world constraints such as the inability of a process to execute  on particular computers, a process needing more than one computer  simultaneously for its execution, a set of processes needing to  be executed on a particular subset of computers, etc., are also  incorporated into the scheme.  The scheme starts with an initial  static load balance and then evolves into an adaptive algorithm.",
