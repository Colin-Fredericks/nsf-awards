The department  is engaged in three major areas of research:  Parallelism and  Languages, Data Compression, and Artificial Intelligence.  The  department is part of the Brandeis Center for Complex Systems and  the theme of parallelism and the study of large complex systems is  common to all three groups.         The research topics to be explored by the parallel programming  group include the design and analysis of parallel algorithms; and  the design and implementation of high level parallel languages  which facilitate the rapid construction of programs that can easily  be verified to be correct and which can be compiled to run  efficiently on MIMD and SIMD machines.  Research topics of the data  compression group include adaptive vector quantization with  variable size vectors, adaptive video compression, issues in coding  theory that include error resilient communication, the design of  high speed data compression hardware, and context prediction for  lexicography.  Research topics for the AI group include data  extraction from existing databases and text corpora, the role of  memory in storing extracted data, and the construction of  integrated agents that are data driven and exhibit goal directed  behavior.",
