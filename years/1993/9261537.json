 "awd_abstract_narration": "Capillary-based optics (Kumakhov optics) control X-ray                     and low-energy neutron beams by means of multiple reflections                   at less than the critical angle.  Optics have demonstrated the                  capability to form convergent or quasi-parallel beams.  Such                    controlled beams have applications in many X-ray and neutron                    material analysis techniques.  Although the current generation                  of Kumakhov optics can provide substantial benefit, assembly                    constraints limit the achievable transmission efficiency,                       energy range, alignment, and minimum focal spot size of the                     resulting beam.  For many material analysis techniques these                    beam parameters affect the spatial resolution, detection                        limits, and measurement time.                                                        A new generation of Kumakhov optics will be developed to                   improve X-ray and neutron beam control.  These optics will be                   manufactured as a single piece.  The channels which deflect                     the photons or neutrons will have variable diameters over the                   length of the optic.  The Phase I effort will include Monte                     Carlo simulations of X-ray transmission efficiency and exit                     divergence with such structures, and experimental measurements                  of the X-ray transmission properties of a few early one-piece                   prototypes.                                                                          Phase II would include development and testing of fully                    functional one-piece optics.  Such optics could potentially                     produce X-ray or neutron focal spot sizes <10 \u001am and channel                    x-rays with energies > 100 keV.",
