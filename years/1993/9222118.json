This is referred to as covert attentional orienting.   Covert orienting allows one to search the visual field for  information in a way that can confuse an observer as to one's  actual focus of attention.  Covert orienting also influences where  one's eyes will move next.  It is critical in gathering information  to determine where visual resources are most needed, a process that  has obvious survival value.    Data from neurological patients have shown that covert orienting  can break down in ways that affect only one half of space.  More  interestingly, the half that is affected is not limited to  retinotopic coordinates or the visual field contralateral to the  affected hemisphere.  It also includes the half of space defined in  scene-based coordinates.  Right hemisphere damage will affect  covert orienting into the left half of retinotopic space, but it  also will affect covert orienting into the left half of a display  rotated 90 degrees from upright where retinal and scene-based  coordinates are dissociated.  This fact means that at least some  spatial parameters of the display are intact in these patients and  are used to guide attentional search.  It also suggests a very  strong link between the internal representation of space and  attentional search of the visual field.    Experiments will address the question of how various spatial  transformations of a display (rotation, reflection, and location  translation) affect different types of attentional orienting.  They  will exploit a rightward bias in normals in early visual orienting  to determine where search begins and what path it follows under  various spatial transformations.  Are some components of covert  orienting tied to retinotopic space and others to scene-based  space, and if so which ones operate in what space?  The issue will  be approached through the combine d study of normals and  neurological patients who neglect one half of their visual space.  These studies will lead to a fuller understanding of how the human  brain represents a visual scene and the interaction between  attentional mechanisms and the internal representations that are  critical for action in the real world.    ***",
