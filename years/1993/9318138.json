 "awd_abstract_narration": "9318138  Mintel  The University of Illinois College of Medicine at Urbana-Champaign  proposes to extend the Urbana campus fiber-optic backbone to Carle  Foundation Hospital, its primary teaching hospital, thus providing  Internet connections for university faculty, staff, and students at  the hospital.  Funds are requested to cover a major portion of the  cost of equipment and services necessary for this extension.  A  major benefit of this project will be the establishment of a huge  virtual medical library, with information from around the world  rapidly accessible to university faculty, staff, and students at  the Carle and the campus departments of the University of Illinois  at Urbana.  Several of those make use of magnetic resonance imaging  techniques and the analytical resources available at the National  Center for Supercomputing Applications, and the Biomedical Magnetic  Resonance Laboratory located on the Urbana campus.  A high-speed  link between Carle and the university campus would greatly  facilitate data and image transfer.  Third, the Carle Foundation  Hospital and Clinics serve as a major consultative resource for  physicians in the diagnosis and management of disease, being  particularly active in the area of rural health care.  Connection  of Carle Foundation Hospital with the University of Illinois  network would provide the final link between Carle's outlying  clinics in rural areas and the Internet, opening the door to  electronic world-wide collaboration in studies on the management  and treatment of disease.  ***",
