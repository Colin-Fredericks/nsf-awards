 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I SBIR project deals with                                            structural/mechanical devices that improve the                                  performance or reduce the cost of earthquake                                    resistant structures.  These devices, such as                                   dampers, isolators, energy dissipators and active                               controls, use materials and technology that are                                 quite new and untried.  Their long term endurance,                              maintenance requirements, and practical                                         applicability have as yet to be demonstrated.                                                                                                                   A special device that is completely within the state                            of the art of standard structural steel construction                            will be developed.  It consists of a specialized                                connector called the \"sequential connector\" that                                admits an initial, limited and repeated zero                                    resistance slip under loading.                                                                                                                                  A structural element, connected by means of the                                 sequential connector to a lateral force resisting                               system, will augment the resistance of the system                               without a corresponding increase in its response                                frequency.  This unique property produces a                                     response to seismic excitation that is significantly                            lower than the displacement response if a standard                              connection is used.  The successful development                                 and application of this innovation will significantly                           reduce the cost of earthquake mitigation and                                    improve the performance of steel buildings.",
