 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Steven Simms and his              colleagues will analyze both skeletal and archaeological remains                recovered in the area around the Great Salt Lake in Utah. In recent             years the water level in the lake was extremely high and wave                   action resulted in the exposure of many prehistoric Native American             burials. Associated with these are archaeological materials which               permit the skeletal remains to be placed within a broader cultural              context. In this project, two related kinds of analysis will take               place. With the permission of the Shoshoni Nation the skeletal                  materials will be studied and DNA will be extracted from bone. With             this information it will be possible to compare groups across time              to examine the question of population continuity. The                           archaeological materials will also be studied to construct a                    chronology, assign cultural designations, and determine how                     lifestyle changed over time.                                                                                                                                    Both archaeological and linguistic data suggest that at                         approximately A.D. 1350 a major change took place in the Great                  Basin. Prior to this time \"Fremont peoples\" practiced a partially               settled agricultural way of life. In the following Late Prehistoric             period agriculture was abandoned and both material culture and                  settlement pattern changed. Shifts in this direction - away from                agriculture and back to older hunting and gathering practices - are             unusual and the goal of this research is to gain insight into how               and why this happened.                                                                                                                                          This research is important for several reasons. First, it will                  provide data of interest to many archaeologists and physical                    anthropologists. Perhaps more importantly it is path-breaking work.             Scientists are just learning how to extract DNA from bone and                   information from bone and more traditional archaeological sources               has never been combined to address a question of prehistory. Thus               the research is significant from a methodological perspective.",
