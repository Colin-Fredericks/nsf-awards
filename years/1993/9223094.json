 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication and synchronization among processes is of  fundamental importance in parallel and distributed systems.  Together, they have an impact on the efficiency, the  design, and the understanding of concurrent programs.  This  research aims at examining shared variable and message passing  systems with respect to mechanisms for interprocess  communication and synchronization.  In the case of shared variable  systems, the question of cache coherence and the  appropriateness of non-atomic shared memory is  considered.  Proof techniques and programming methodologies  are developed for dealing with non-atomic memories.  In the  case of message passing systems, the question of locality of  computations is investigated.  Complexity measures that  measure locality and efficient algorithms for  commonly occurring synchronization problems are developed.  The impact of failures and dynamic networks on algorithms and  tight lower bounds on various performance measures are  explored.  Finally, the research examines mixed  programming paradigms that support both shared memory and  message passing.  As a part of this research, efficient  simulations of shared memory on an underlying message passing  architecture are designed.",
