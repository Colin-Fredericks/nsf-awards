 "awd_abstract_narration": "9357637  Kepler    This is a National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award.   The awardee is using a mathematical modeling approach to the  problem of how immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (B-cells)  develop in lymphatic tissue.  Specifically, he will elucidate the  process of somatic hypermutation within germinal centers by  mathematical modeling studies.  He will address mathematical  problems arising in stochastic population dynamic models with many  species interacting through competition for resources and random  mutation, in which very small and very large populations coexist  and which possess a non-trivial spatial structure.  %%%  One of the primary ways the vertebrate immune system defends  against pathogens is by producing immunoglobulins (antibodies) (Ig)  that bind specifically to molecular epitopes on the pathogen, thus  marking it for destruction by the effector mechanisms of the immune  system.  The system has no prior knowledge of the foreign epitopes  it will encounter, so it must have an efficient scheme for  generating sufficient diversity to cover the space of all potential  invaders.  That scheme is now in part understood.  Each Ig-  producing B-cells assembles its Ig-encoding genes more or less  randomly, with the resulting gene product (Ig) borne as a receptor  on its membrane.  Upon meeting a complementary antigen, the B-cell  is stimulated to divide rapidly and differentiate into Ig-secreting  cells.  In warm-blooded animals, the immune system further sharpens  its initial response through affinity maturation, during which a  mutagenic process within the responding B cell populations is  activated and targeted specifically at the Ig genes.  Competition  for antigenic stimulation provides selective pressure, and the  average affinity of the responding population increases, often by  two or more orders of magnitude.  The immune system retains a  memory of its encounter through progeny \"memory\" B-cells, so   subsequent challenges by the same antigen are met with  a faster and  stronger response than initially.  This is the basis for  immunization.  These events (somatic hypermutation and development  of memory B cells) occur physically within histologically defined  structures called germinal centers (GC) which form in the  peripheral lymphoid tissue after antigenic challenge.  The goal of  this research is to employ mathematical modeling and computer  simulation to examine the process.  The GC reaction is not only  critical to the functioning of the immune system, but is itself a  beautifully self-contained model of Darwinian evolution in  miniature (and in vivo).  The relevant genomes are small and the  \"fitness function\" is measurable in a manifestly non-circular way.   A thorough quantitative understanding of the GC reaction will thus  provide insight into matters fundamental to general biology as well  as to immunology per se.  ***",
