 "awd_abstract_narration": "9355034  Palmer    Twenty members of Berkeley's Institute of Cognitive Studies propose  an integrated graduate research training program in the  interdisciplinary field of cognitive science with a focus on  spatial cognition.  We request funds to support a five-year  training program for five graduate students to consist of both  coursework and research on the theme of spatial cognition,  including spatial perception, language, and reasoning.  Students  will we required to take a set of five basic lecture courses and a  series of research seminars to ensure adequate background knowledge  in computer science, linguistics, psychology, and biology on topics  integral to research on spatial cognition.  Research training will  occur as the trainees engage in research on topics within a number  of well-established projects at Berkeley on the theme of spatial  cognition, including:  (l) cross-linguistic studies of lexical  semantics, (2) the nature of spatical and temporal metaphors,  (3)the acquisition of spatial language by children in different  cultures, (4) the \"psychophysics\" of spatial terms, (5) the  biological basis of spatial cognition, (6) the representation of  spatial knowledge, (7) computational models for understanding,  learning, and producing spatial descriptions, and (8) biological  aspects of spatial cognition in animals and humans.  Both faculty  and trainees will take part in a series of research seminars  focusing on the results of these research projects.  ***",
