 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this research is to elucidate the molecular               mechanisms that regulate fruit abscission in higher plants. It has              been documented that cellulase (beta, 1:4 glucan glucanhydrolase)               increases in the abscission zone of Phaseolus vulgaris during leaf              fracture. It is also known that this increase in cellulase activity             can be accelerated by the addition of exogenous ethylene. A cDNA                clone, complementary to bean cellulase mRNA has been recently                   isolated and messenger RNA complementary to it has been shown to                increase dramatically in the abscission zone several hours after                ethylene treatment of bean. The kinetics suggest that other                     cellular events precede cellulase appearance in signalling                      abscission. One approach to identifying the mechanism through which             ethylene promotes fruit abscission is to examine those genes which              respond rapidly to externally applied ethylene. Dr. Klein proposes              here to isolate and characterize ethylene responsive genes that are             rapidly induced in the abscission zone and examine their expression             during fruit abscission in tomato.",
