Throughout Southeast Asia, the development of the modern state, capitalis m, education, the media, and other institutions of modernity have altered the bases of Islamic social communities.  These socio economic changes have engendered a crisis of tradition that is characterized by what Geertz calls \"a struggle to define the real\".  This struggle is a self conscious and sustained effort to construct a sense of self and create new moral boundaries around communities.          The crisis of tradition, the social reconstruction of community, and modern reinterpretations of Islam were themes that concerned an earlier generation of Southeast Asian scholars.  Much of this early scholarship, however, failed to appreciate the depth of changes that societies were undergoing and the extraordinary vitality of Muslim communities.  Though many scholars predicted that Islamic revitalization was nothing more than a temporary phenomenon that was likely to give way to the inexorable forces of modernization and secularization, the political and moral force of Islam in South Asian has not diminished.  Instead Islam in Southeast has embarked on a new phase of intensive development.  Conference participants will examine the social form and cultural meanings of this vitalization to understand the ways Southeast Asian Muslims use Islam to construct their identities in contexts of modernity and the nation state. ***   #    x   \\        P    C      X P#",
