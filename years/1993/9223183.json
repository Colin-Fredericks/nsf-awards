 "awd_abstract_narration": "Process algebras are a basic tool in the theory of concurrency:  a  mathematical model simple enough to analyze and understand, yet  complex  enough to illustrate many of the subtleties and problems  of concurrency.  They  have been used for theory, programming  language design, and specification and  verification languages.  For sequential languages, a few models of  computation  suffice.  However, there are a variety of forms of  concurrency, and hence a variety of process algebras.  It if  therefore  essential to: (1) understand the connections between the many schools of  process algebra, (2) have theoretical and computer tools for designing and  analyzing process algebras, and (3) understand commonalties and metatheory of  process  algebra, to avoid unnecessarily repeating the same work  in many  settings.    A general framework for investigating process algebras in terms  of  their structured operational semantics (SOS) is formulated  and a surprising   connection between SOS and  equational definitions  established.  In particular, operations that respect the most commonly-used   process  equivalences are axiomatizable from their SOS  specifications.  It is believed that this connection is theoretically fundamental and of   substantial practical value to researchers.  An elaboration of this paradigm   should unify two major communities in process algebra, and provide valuable   tools to researchers in  concurrency.",
