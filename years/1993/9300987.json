 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed support for the Conference of                       Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (CEME).  The purpose of                 the conference is to stimulate discussion and research on the                   frontiers of the state-of-the-art of econometric and mathematical               economic theory and methodology and the application of advanced                 mathematical, statistical, and numerical analysis techniques in                 empirical economic studies.  The conference hastens and improves                knowledge and its use, by shortening the time lags between the                  conception of ideas and their dissemination and by inducing                     leading scholars cooperatively to apply their talents to the                    identification, selection, and resolution of issues which are                   receiving inadequate attention.  The objectives of CEME are                     accomplished by supporting on-going seminars for the exchange of                ideas in econometrics and mathematical economics.  CEME seminars                provide informal channels of communication among specialists                    resident in widely geographically dispersed institutions.  The                  seminars provide for more sustained interaction among specialists               in selected topic areas than is generally possible at meetings of               professional societies.                                                                                                                                         Since November, 1970, fifteen different seminar groups have been                formed, and five are currently active.  The leaders and                         participants in the seminars consist of a changing set of                       scholars depending on topic and research being conducted in the                 field.  Meetings of the seminars are planned by the leaders or by               other leading researchers chosen by them.  The current active                   seminars are general equilibrium models, comparison of                          econometric models, time series analysis, Bayesian inference in                 econometrics and decentralized economic planning.",
