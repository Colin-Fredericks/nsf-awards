 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports seven U.S. anthropologists to participate in a              regional European workshop on the ethnography of modern Iceland.                The small meeting is jointly organized by Dr. E. Paul Durrenberger              of the University of Iowa and Dr. Gisli Palsson of the Faculty of               Social Science of the University of Iceland.   It will be held at               the University of Iowa in late May, 1993.  The objective of the                 workshop is to analyze ethnographic aspects of major questions                  facing modern Iceland, especially in the context of ongoing                     developments in Europe and America.  Among these issues are                     negotiations about regulating fishing and whaling under the European            Economic Community (EEC), how the economic and political system of              Iceland affects its relations with the emerging EEC, the role of                American policy and Icelanders' reaction to it.  In addition, the               meeting participants will analyze the colonial roots of the modern              period and the political uses of the past in the construction of                national identity.                                                                                                                                              This meeting will encourage expansion of the focus of research on               the culture and people of Iceland away from the romantic-                       nationalistic school of folk studies and toward examination of its              place in the contemporary world.  The discussions are also likely to            contribute to the broader question of what constitutes an adequate              ethnographic description of a highly literate and modern state                  society.",
