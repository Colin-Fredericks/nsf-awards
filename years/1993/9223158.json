 "awd_abstract_narration": "International accords to advance the protection of the global                   environment are newly prominent in international relations.  Little             is known about their effectiveness, however, in part because                    standard assumptions about implementation and compliance are not                easily applicable when the national interest of the parties is not              directly at stake.  This study will gather basic data about how and             why ten countries entered into five environmental accords, what                 they have done to implement them, and whether they are complying                with the international obligations created by these accords.  These             findings will be related to a set of legal, social, political and               economic factors that are likely to affect implementation and                   compliance.  The five accords to be considered address not only the             familiar topics of conservation of natural resources and pollution              but also the larger emerging topics of global environmental                     changes, such as ozone depletion and possible climate change.                   Analysis of these data will provide the empirical basis for an                  important theoretical contribution to our understanding of the                  effectiveness of international agreements in the new circumstances              of the contemporary world.                                                                                                                                      The project will include field work and data collection in all ten              countries.  Interviews will be conducted with key participants in               the process.  The project aims to create a data base to be used by              other scholars as well as the knowledge necessary to provide                    guidance for policy communities in the global environmental field.              It is anticipated that this project will be the basis for                       developing a field of study that is comparable in rigor and                     knowledge to the study of arms control.",
