We propose research to enhance the ability  of corporations to understand recycling, improve their product  and process design for the environment, and measure the  improvements resulting from our collaboration.  Our work consists  of six tasks:  1. Improve measures of the environmental  consequences of alternative products or designs.  Without  quantitative measures, goals are vague and management performance  cannot be assessed.  2.  Estimate and implement our measures for  a range of IBM printers.  We will collaborate with IBM to meet  the corporate goal of increased environmental friendliness  through developing and implement our measures and approach.  3.  Implement a system that informs the designers at IBM of the  environmental implications of alternative designs, materials,  choices, and other design issues.  We will explore both intrusive  and non-intrusive systems.  4.  Examine the ways in which the  tools can be designed into a company's organizational structure.   We seek ways to have companies meet environmental goals routinely  and inexpensively without excess time of top executives or  decreased produce quality.  5.  Investigate organizational  learning by examining the extent to which our tools affect  product design, particularly as measured by our indices, and how  the use of these tools disseminate through the organization and  become more valuable to designers over time.  We will explore how  to increase productivity while enhancing environmental  friendliness.  6.  Transfer our results and indices to a second  company making a quite different product.  The Ford Motor Company  will work with us in transferring the research results from IBM  to quite a different setting.***",
