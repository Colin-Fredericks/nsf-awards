 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal: 9357130  PI: Therien    Professor Michael Therien of the University of  Pennsylvania is the recipient of this NSF young  Investigator Award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and  Organometallic Chemistry Program.  He has launched his  career by developing a new synthetic strategy for  preparing substituted porphyrins, by using the method to  obtain a wide variety of donor-acceptor molecules based  on porphyrins, and by using these molecules to explore  the electronic coupling between the two centers.  Under  the present grant he will exploit these molecules in  order to assess the relative importance of hole versus  electron tunneling, to measure coupling through \"weak\"  links such as hydrogen bonds, to probe the significance  of quantum beats in ultrafast electron transfer, and to  develop catalysts for alkane oxidation.  %%%  Reactions in which an electron transfers from one site to  another are among the most intriguing, significant, and  at the same time apparently simple that can occur in  biological systems.  In such systems electron transfer  can take place over long distances, and then the  intervening medium assumes an important role.  By  designing molecules in which electron transfer can be  forced to flow through specified linkages, fundamental  and general questions can be answered regarding the  control that these linkages exert.  Such molecules will  be constructed on the basis of porphyrins, which are  molecules that are widely found to participate in  biological electron transfer.  The results will  illuminate the details of porphyrin chemistry, develop  the theoretical understanding of electron transfer, and  provide synthetic catalysts for industrially significant  reactions.",
