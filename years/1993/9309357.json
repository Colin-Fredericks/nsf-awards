 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the most important dimensions of the recent                         transformation to a service economy within the United States has                been the growth of producer-service industries, firms that                      provide products and services to business firms and other                       organizations, such as government agencies.  From 1980 to 1988,                 these firms accounted for roughly one-third of all new jobs                     established in the nation.  The growth of these firms has                       substantially altered the ways that American businesses organize                production.  Most producer-services firms locate in metropolitan                areas and become parts of complex corporate networks, which                     usually consist of headquarters hubs linked to producer-service                 firms.  This project will expand knowledge about the spatial and                social structures of these complex corporate networks in                        metropolitan areas of the U.S. through in-depth case studies of                 four networks, two in manufacturing and two in services.                        Personal interviews will be conducted with officials in both                    contracting companies and producer-service contractors in the                   Akron, Cleveland, Kansas City, and San Francisco metropolitan                   areas.  Special attention will focus on identification of the                   reasons why U.S. corporations have turned to outside contractors                for the provision of producer services, how externalization of                  producer services has been related to broader forms of industrial               organization, what social relations underlie market relationships               between firms and producer-service providers, how forms of                      producer-service externalization vary among different types of                  industries, how corporate complexes have been spatially                         restructured, and what factors contribute to these spatial                      shifts.  Data from these interviews will be used to form and test               hypotheses about the spatial and social structure of industrial                 organization.  They also will facilitate the development of a                   theoretical model of producer-service externalization, which will               be tested in subsequent studies.                                                     This project will help fill important gaps in knowledge                    about the dramatic restructuring of American industry, especially               the growth of producer-service firms and their operation within                 complex corporate networks.  The data collected in interviews                   with both suppliers and users of producer services will test a                  number of important hypotheses, and they will assist in                         development of more general models of industrial organization.",
