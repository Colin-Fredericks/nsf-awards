 "awd_abstract_narration": "9358516  Atman    Engineering education for the beginning student should 1)engage the  student's interest so he/she will stay in engineering and 2)provide  the student with a foundation for learning how to function  successfully in a world of rapid technological change.  As a way to  meet these challenges, many engineering schools are changing their  curricula to include realistic engineering problems for students to  solve in their freshman year.  These can be semester long  engineering design projects or shorter problems that are open-ended  in nature.  By giving freshman engineers open-ended problems to  solve, we will provide them with a simulated real world experience,  but at this print we have no research base from which to provide  recommendations for the engineering professors who must guide  students through the ambiguity of the engineering design process.   What can we expect a freshman engineer to extract about the  engineering process while solving open-ended problems?  Does the  student apply what is learned in one problem to the next problem  encountered?    The objective of this work is to document the problem-solving  approach novice engineers take when presented with ambiguous, pen-  ended design problems.  This will be accomplished b a series of  think-aloud studies that examine various aspects of engineering  students' strategies for solving open-ended problems.  These data  will answer questions such as 1)do \"good\" students and \"poor\"  students differ in their approach to studying case study material  and solving open ended problems?  2)do approaches to engineering  design problems of these two student groups differ from experienced  engineers?, and 3)do engineering students generate self-  explanations as they study case-study material about design  problems, and does this help them improve their performance in  design tasks?  The answers to these questions will contribute to a  research base from which recommendations will be developed for  teaching strategies to facilitat e learning for engineering  students.  ***",
