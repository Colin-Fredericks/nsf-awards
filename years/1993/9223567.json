 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers agree that new firm creation is a process, not an                   event.  However, little is known about the formation stage when                 individuals first assemble properties needed to form viable                     economic entities.  By not attending to this formation stage,                   researchers risk overlooking characteristics of sub-populations                 especially susceptible to early extinction.  Women-owned                        businesses may represent one such group.  The objective of this                 Research Planning Grant is to determine how organizations come                  into existence, and ascertain ways the gestation process may vary               by factors such as gender of the founding entrepreneur.  Besides                contributing to theory development, findings from the proposed                  research have the potential for impacting public policy regarding               the development of women-owned businesses.  Business starts among               women far outpace those of men, yet women seemingly still face                  significant economic and social barriers.  Activities proposed                  for the planning grant period will: (a) provide insight into the                causal processes underlying new firm gestation; (b) develop ways                to assess those processes; and (c) resolve methodological issues                that currently impede researchers in studying the formation                     stage.  Principal among the activities is the analysis of data on               entrepreneurs collected during a statewise survey.  The                         investigator was co-principal investigator on this project.  The                planning grant would support further development of this research               stream and the investigator's career development.",
