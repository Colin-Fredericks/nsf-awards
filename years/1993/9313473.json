 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313473  Ondov       This award to the University of Maryland allows them to  renovate the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry's  Environmental Low Contamination Facility.  This facility was  constructed in 1978, primarily, for the preparation and  handling of materials and samples associated with aerosol  particulate collections in urban and remote areas, and the  packaging of these materials for  instrumental neutron  activation analysis.  A laminar-flow clean bench, installed  at this time, continues to provide the department's only  clean facility for sample digestion and chemical separation.  Due to increased activity in this scientific area and due to  the deterioration of the facility, there is a great need to  modernize this laboratory space.       Based on numbers of Ph.D. graduates, the Analytical-  Nuclear-Environmental Division's efforts make the University  of Maryland one of the largest institutions for graduate  environmental research.  Recognized internationally for  their research in marine geochemistry, nuclear and marine  chemistry, and atmospheric aerosol chemistry, the Maryland  professors offer one of the few nationally-recognized  graduate environmental science programs, and one of the few  programs that train students in nuclear analytical methods.  Trends in environmental research continue to demand larger  numbers of analyses with ever increasing analytical  sensitivity, thereby intensifying the demand for improved  analytical technology, methods and concomitant clean room  facilities.  The renovations to be completed will support  the work of outstanding researchers in this field as well as  22 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  ***",
