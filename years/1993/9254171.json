 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"non-majors\" biology laboratory course has been                             substantially revised at Baylor University to include                           activities shown by recent research to be effective. Methods                    including cooperative learning, inquiry-based instruction, and                  emphasis on critical thinking and writing have been successful,                 but problems remain.  Interdisciplinary studies, expanded                       biology experiences, training of teaching assistants, feedback                  on writing assignments, sensitivity to ethnic and gender                        differences in learning styles, and structure of the teaching                   laboratory are all topics that have been identified for further                 study and improvement. The National Science Foundation grant                    will support interdisciplinary workgroups to address these                      problems and to recruit and support exceptional science                         graduate students who are interested in teaching.  Baylor has                   committed funds for renovation of the laboratory, and a                         separate grant or corporate partnership will be solicited to                    improve technology.  This innovative curriculum for                             undergraduate bioliteracy instruction and an intensive program                  for training of teaching assistants will serve as models for                    introductory biology education at comprehensive research                        universities and colleges.",
