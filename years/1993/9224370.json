 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to improve the quality of                 statistical inference methods available to an experimenter                      through the use of improved and custom-designed confidence sets.                While it is clear that confidence bounds on a set of parameters                 are more informative to an experimenter than the answer to a                    hypothesis test formulation of the problem, there are many                      essentially basic statistical inference problems where current                  techniques for confidence set construction are either crude,                    inefficient or nonexistent.                                                          This may be because of a complicated distributional set-up,                because the real parameters of interest are functions of other                  basic parameters, or because the experimenter has chosen to                     emphasize certain kinds of information such as directional                      decisions.  In many settings, the experimenter has some clearly                 defined objectives which can rightly and sensibly be used to                    determine a sensitive and powerful inference method, yet will                   find out that confidence sets are currently only available for                  standard less specific inference approaches. The construction of                custom-designed confidence sets associated with these specific                  inference procedures will enable the experimenter to make a                     fuller and more complete inference than is often currently                      possible.  It is important to develop these techniques and to                   make them widely available since many decisions type inference                  are currently being made, such as in comparative drug trials, in                which the decision results are being reported (e.g., drug A is                  more effective than drug B) and where, in fact, additional free                 information (such as a confidence interval for the difference in                the efficacies of drugs A and B) is also available but is not                   being utilized.                                                                      This research will consider ways to improve current data                   analysis techniques.  The measurement of data and the subsequent                analysis of such data inevitably involves some uncertainty, and                 the objective of this research is to develop improved ways of                   dealing with this uncertainty through the science of statistical                inference.  This investigation will consider both the design of                 experiments or data collection schemes, together with the                       analysis of the data.  The main thrust of the research will be to               develop new ways of presenting the results of statistical                       analyses which are designed to be clear and intiutively                         comprehensible to the lay person.  Moreover, these methods must                 be accurate and they must efficiently summarize all the available               information.   These new techniques will be useful for                          researchers and experimenters in areas such as engineering,                     quality control, clinical trials, medical studies and other                     important fields.",
