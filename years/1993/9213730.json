 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flash floods are major meteorological disasters which occur                around the globe.  Understanding of this phenomena is a challenging             problem because it is necessary to understand both complex dynamic              and microphysical processes at scales of motion that are smaller                than typically measured by conventional weather networks.  This                 scale of motion is termed mesoscale by meteorologists.                               The National Science Council of Taiwan has established a                   Multiple Hazards Mitigation Project whose meteorological component              is focussed on improving flash flood predictions -- especially                  flooding associated with a meteorological phenomenon known as the               Mei-Yu front.  A major field project to study the systems that                  cause flash floods, entitled the Taiwan Area Mesoscale Experiment,              was held in the Spring of 1987.  The project was cosponsored by the             National Science Council with participation of the National Science             Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration              of the United States.                                                                Under a previous award the Principal Investigator developed                and applied a three-dimensional numerical model to the                          investigation of the characteristics of the Mei-Yu and its                      interactions with the topography of Taiwan and the synoptic                     environment.  The model was able to accurately simulate and reveal              details of the dynamics of flash flood events.                                       The Principal Investigator will continue and expand on his                 previous research.  Specific objectives include investigating:                  formation of the low-level jet and its interaction with the                     topography and mesoscale flows; the effects of diabatic                         heating/cooling on mesoscale circulations near the Mei-Yu; and the              interactions between the mesoscale events and the synoptic scale                forcing.",
