 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311042  Zeiger    The goal of this research is to investigate possible roles of  carotenoids in blue light photoreception in guard cells.  Blue  light responses of guard cells include starch hydrolysis, malate  biosynthesis, and proton pumping at the guard cell plasma membrane.   These processes modulate guard cell osmotic potentials and stomatal  apertures that are quantitatively related to incident fluence rates  of blue light.  A study on guard cell pigments has recently shown  that absorption spectra of guard cell carotenoids closely match an  action spectrum of the blue light-stimulated increases in stomatal  conductances, pointing to a role of carotenoids in photoreception.   It is proposed that a carotenoid in the thylakoid membrane can  function in two alternative states.  At moderate transmembrane  potentials across the thylakoid, the carotenoid would operate as an  accessory pigment funneling absorbed light energy into  photosynthetic reactions.  At high transmembrane potentials, the  carotenoid would move away from the chlorophyll molecules and, upon  blue light excitation, would activate a sensory transduction  process leading to typical blue light responses.  Initial results  supporting this hypothesis include the characterization of  intrinsic blue light responses of guard cell chloroplasts, and a  specific inhibition of the blue light-stimulated stomatal opening  by the inhibitor of zeaxanthin biosynthesis, DTT.  In addition,  measurements of rates of stomatal conductances, the magnitude of  blue light responses of guard cell chloroplasts, and zeaxanthin  concentrations in guard cells of F2 plants from a cross between a  primitive and an advanced cotton line with contrasting stomatal  conductances and blue light sensitivity, showed that plants with  high conductances had guard cells with large blue light responses  and a high zeaxanthin concentration, and vice versa.  The proposed  research will use spectroscopic, physiological, biochemical and  genetic approaches with guard cell s and coleoptiles, to probe the  involvement of a carotenoid, possibly zeaxanthin, in blue light  sensory transduction in plant cells.  %%%  One of the most fundamental responses of a plant to the environment  is the response to blue light.  Blue light stimulates the growing  tip of a young plant to turn and grow toward light, and controls  the opening of pores in leaves (stomata) that allow gas and water  exchange across the leaf surface.  The mechanism by which plant  cells sense blue light is not yet understood.  As the first step in  the response, blue light must be absorbed by a specific chemical  photoreceptor, but this photoreceptor has not yet been identified  with certainty.  Circumstantial evidence has led many investigators  in the field to believe that the photoreceptor is a type of organic  molecule known as a \"flavin\".  Dr. Zeiger, however, has evidence  suggesting that a different class of molecule, a \"carotenoid\" may,  instead, be the blue light receptor.  The goal of this research is  to determine whether the carotenoid is the real blue light  receptor.  Establishing the nature of the blue light photoreceptor  would be a very important contribution to understanding of this   fundamental plant response to the environment.***",
