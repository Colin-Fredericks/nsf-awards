 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is for travel support for American scientists to              participate in a symposium on the interplay between the nervous,                endocrine and immune systems to be held in conjunction with the                 annual meeting of the American Society of Zoologists in Vancouver,              British Columbia. State-of-the-art lectures will be held on (1)                 behavioral regulation of immunity and (2) mechanisms and                        consequences of central nervous system and immune system                        interactions.  The emphasis of these presentations is on the                    use of diverse biological systems.  The goal of this meeting is to              encourage greater research participation by zoologists in this new              and expanding field.  The hope is that conveying the conceptual and             empirical advancements in psychoneuroendocrinology will lead to the             development of new experimental approaches which, in turn, will be              used to unravel the complex mechanisms, pathways and feedback loops             that serve to communicate interactions between these three systems.             Elucidating the basic mechanisms underlying stress and                          developing coping strategies will be one outcome of a better                    understanding of this intimate relationship between the neural,                 endocrine and immune systems.",
