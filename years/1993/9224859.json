 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues mathematical work on problems in the                study of functions and domains in the space of several complex                  variables.  The first involves a combination of ordinary                        differential equations and several complex variables where one is               interested in holomorphic vector fields, realized as systems of                 differential equations.  The solution vectors provide examples of               one parameter groups of automorphisms of the full n-dimensional                 space.  When the vector field is complete, the automorphisms can                be continued indefinitely.  One goal of this project is                         to determine the extent to which every holomorphic vector field                 can be approximated by a complete one. A second line of                         investigation focuses on the image of two-dimensional space under               a holomorphic embedding.  More precisely, work will be done in                  determining the type of algebraic variety which can be omitted by               such an embedding.  It is known that one complex line may be                    omitted and three complex lines cannot.  Additional work will be                done in an effort to understand how the example of Duval allows                 for a Lagrangian disk to be embedded in two-dimensional space                   which is not polynomially convex.  Yet, in the appropriate sense,               allpolynomial hulls can always be explained in terms of                         holomorphic disks.  The difference must lie somewhere between the               idea of a holomorphic disk and the older idea of an H-infinity                  disk. Questions of this type have been studied for decades, so                  progress is expected to be slow.                                                     Several complex variables arose at the beginning of the                    century as a natural outgrowth of studies of functions of one                   complex variable.  It became clear early on that the theory                     differed widely from its predecessor.  The underlying geometry                  was far more difficult to grasp and the function theory had far                 more affinity with partial differential operators of first order.               It thus grew as a hybrid subject combining deep characteristics                 of differential geometry and differential equations.  Many of the               fundamental structures were defined in the last three decades.                  Current studies still concentrate on understanding these basic                  mathematical forms.",
