Building upon a successful pilot project involving                    African-American students and mentors, PACTS aims to foster                     positive attitudes about science careers and increase students                  leadership skills and self-estee.  Through bi-weekly hands-on                   science workshops with African-American Scientists as mentors,                  students will strengthen their understanding of science                         concepts and enhance their critical thinking skills.  On                        alternate Saturdays, students will participate in                               college/career workshops.  PACTS students will also have the                    opportunity to tutor younger students, visit science                            laboratories, and serve as science museum demonstrators.                        Additional support and encouragment will be provided through                    a network of community resources involving partnerships among                   scientists, professional associations, community centers,                       corporations and a science center.  The PACTS model will be                     disseminated nationally through museum conferences, the                         national networks of professional associations and                              corporations, and presentations by PACTS staff to interested                    organizations in other cities.",
