 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317722  Smith  Advances in the area of automatic  control, artificial intelligence,  smart materials, sensors, and  actuators have made the development  of intelligent structures feasible.   Such structures would have the  ability to identify their dynamical  state, including parameter  variations; identify functional  descriptions of external stimuli,  e.g. earthquake loads, high winds,  traffic; and adaptively generate the  required actuation forces in the  presence of major stimuli.  In order  to develop such an intelligent  structure several research issues  have to be studied.  This  investigation focuses on the   formulation and development of a  neural-based control scheme, with  emphasis on learning of structural  parameter variations, and design and  construction of a new low-powered  adaptive actuation system for  structures.  The resulting  intelligent structural control  system will have a fuzzy based  uncertainty compensator.    The overall research objective is to  evaluate and compare performances of  intelligent and conventional control  systems.  A  prototype structure,  namely a small scaled cable bridge  will be constructed for experimental  purposes.  The proposed actuators  and control systems will be  integrated and implemented on this  experimental structure, and the  effects of soil - structure  interaction will be emulated and  considered.  ***",
