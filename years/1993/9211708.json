 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ionospheric tomography is a new and innovative method for two-                  dimensional reconstruction of distribution in the ionosphere.                   Reconstructing high resolution images of electron density                       distributions would allow communication systems to compensate for               the irregularities in these distributions which cause significant               interference.  Accurate images of these irregularities would also               assist in the determination of their origins.  Previously, remote               sensing techniques were limited to measuring these distributions                integrated over a path, or at individual locations.                             Current reconstruction techniques are based upon x-ray tomography               algorithms which are not well-suited for ionospheric tomography                 due to the geometry of the data acquisition system.  The                        differences between these systems cause considerable resolution                 degradation in the reconstructed images.  This proposal is for                  preliminary studies in the development of specialized algorithms                for ionospheric tomography.  Substantial a priori information on                the formation of these distributions is available and ionosonde                 measurements provide accurate values at specific locations.  This               a priori information can be used in specialized algorithms to                   compensate for the geometric limitations of the data acquisition                system.                                                                         The program of research would be for 18 months from the start of                the project.  Upon completion of preliminary investigations, a                  full-scale research proposal would be developed.",
