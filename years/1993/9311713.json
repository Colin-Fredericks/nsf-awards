Professor Freeman, whose research has been                    largely experimental, will spend the Fall Quarter at UCLA                       acquiring expertise in molecular modeling and computational                     chemistry under the tutelage of Professor Kendall Houk. The PI                  will learn the fundamental principles of modeling programs                      including ALCHEMY III, AM-1, INSIGHT/DISCOVER, MACCS-3D, MM3,                   PCMODEL, SPARTAN and GAUSSIAN92. Upon his return to UCI, he                     will apply these computational programs to his current research                 interests on vicinal-disulfoxides, Diels-Alder reactions of                     azadienes, C-nucleosides as antivirals, and 1,3-dipolar                         cycloadditions.                                                                 %%%                                                                             This career advancement award will enable the PI to learn the                   scope and limitations of molecular and quantum mechanics and                    allow him to apply them to current research areas as well as                    broaden his interests into biotechnology, peptide chemistry and                 computer-aided drug design. His knowledge of computational                      chemistry will also be of benefit to his undergraduate and                      graduate students.",
