 "awd_abstract_narration": "99220260  Spanswick    This research is the continuation of a program designed with the  long term objective of understanding transport in plant cells in  terms of a chemiosmotic scheme for the transport of ions across  plant cell membranes.  The specific problem addressed in this  proposal is that raised by the observation that the coupling  between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport by ATPases from both  the plasma membrane and the tonoplast appears to be variable  depending, for example, upon the concentration of anions present in  the membrane vesicle suspension.  Hypotheses involving intrinsic u  coupling between transport and ATPase activity (\"slip\") or  electrically driven passive proton fluxes (\"leak\") will be tested  by a variety of methods to account for the apparent discrepancy  between anion stimulation of ATPase-mediated proton fluxes and of  ATPase activity.  %%%  A proper distribution of salts between the inside and outside of a  cell and the inside and outside of individual cellular compartments  is critical for the normal function of all cells.  The long term  goal of this research is to understand the transport mechanisms for  ions such as protons, potassium, and sodium (the components of  salts) across the membranes of plant cells to maintain their normal  distributions.  This requires understanding the properties of the  individual ion transport systems.  A useful overall hypothesis for  the mechanism of ion transport is based on a scheme in which the  primary active transport systems are enzymes that transport protons  (hydrogen ions) across cell membranes against an electrochemical  gradient, using energy from hydrolysis of the energy-rich molecule,  ATP.  According to this scheme, other ions are transported by way  of secondary systems that derive their energy from the  electrochemical gradient of protons.  (Transport of calcium ions  across the plasma membrane is an exception.)  The specific goal of  this project is to study in some detail the relation between ATP  hydro lysis and proton transport across the plant cell outer  membrane and the membrane of an intracellular compartment, the  tonoplast.  The results of this research should provide a  fundamental piece of the puzzle that in the long run will result in  a complete understanding of how plants maintain their salt balance.  ***",
