 "awd_abstract_narration": "Historically, parallel computers have focussed on a   single  mode  of parallelism:  Multiple-Instruction Multiple-Data  (MIMD)   Single-Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD).  Some new    computers efficiently  implement both paradigms in a single  integrated   ``universal'' architecture  capable of supporting  large numbers of powerful processing   nodes in a design  scalable to teraflop computation.  Clearly, this capability   to  perform well on  both SIMD and MIMD computation is the  basis for many future  high-performance architectures.  This  hybrid parallelism is   also ideally suited  for implementing  many algorithms for large-scale   mathematical programming,  since these methods require powerful individual processors   for  the solution of  optimization subproblems (which may take the  form of a   medium-sized linear or  quadratic program), efficient  message passage capabilities   for the transfer of  subproblem  solutions, and efficient synchronization and   SIMD-style  operations  across processors.  Proper algorithmic design thus allows the   solution of  optimization ``megaproblems'' that  were intractable on   preceding architectures.  This project focuses on network-related optimization problems   because  such  problems arise in a great variety of real world  applications   for which there  are real data as well as problem  generators.",
