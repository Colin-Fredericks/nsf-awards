 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrial ecosystems may have significant feedbacks to                   global climate change, although the magnitude and direction of                  these feedbacks is largely unknown.  Boreal wetlands are of                     particular importance due to their large extent, production of                  anaerobic \"greenhouse\" gases, globally significant stores of                    carbon in peat, and potential feedbacks with increased                          temperatures.  We propose to manipulate water-table levels and                  soil temperatures in bog and fen mesocosms to determine the                     direct and indirect feedbacks between climate change and southern               boreal peatlands.  Intact blocks of peat, with the accompanying                 shrub, moss, and graminoid vegetation layers will be used.  Also,               the regional groundwater flow in natural fens will be simulated.                A full array of community and ecosystem responses will be                       measured, including trace gas fluxes, nutrient mineralization and               availability, net changes in carbon and nutrient pools, changes                 in soil substrate quality over time, pore water chemistry, plant                community composition, plant nutrient uptake, plant and microbial               biomass, and primary productivity.                                              %%%                                                                             Our central hypothesis is:  Temperature and aeration status                     directly control the rates and partitioning of trace gas fluxes                 and soil nutrient availability in peatlands, but this climate -                 soil link is constrained by soil substrate quality.  Soil                       nutrient availability in turn controls plant dynamics, which will               feedback on soil substrate quality.  The previous research of                   the investigators has shown that the three primary controlling                  variables (substrate quality, temperature, aeration status)                     interact in nonlinear, nonintuitive ways.  Direct experimentation               will unravel the hierarchy of controlling factors in boreal                     peatlands and allow us to make robust predictions of responses to               future climate change.",
