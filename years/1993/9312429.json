 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several chemical reactions which involve highly reactive,                       short-lived intermediates will be examined. The role of                         these intermediates will be probed with time-resolved                           absorption spectroscopy and photoacoustic calorimetry. Two                      major goals will be pursued. First, these techniques will be                    applied to reactive intermediates which include 1,1- and                        1,4-biradicals and their oxidation products, 1,1- and 1,4-                      biradical cations. Second, the results will be used to                          understand what factors are important in determining how                        these intermediates are converted to products. Factors such                     as substitution, temperature, method of generation, and                         solvent will be considered, which will provide insight into                     how structure and thermodynamics affect their reactivity.                       %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Joshua L. Goodman at the University of                       Rochester. Key reactive intermediates in organic chemistry                      will be studied that have two formal bonds to carbon                            (carbenes or 1,1-biradicals) and three formal bonds (1,4-                       biradicals). In the latter instance, two such carbon centers                    are found in an intermediate. These intermediates will be                       probed by spectroscopic and calorimetric means on a short                       time-scale. The results will provide an understanding as to                     what factors determine the products from these                                  intermediates.",
