 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309812  Villas-Boas    Random utility choice models are commonly utilized in empirical  work in a variety of theoretical and appliced areas.  These models  typically have two components: a deterministic component of utility  which is function of observed variables, and a stochastic component  or error term.      This project will develop a new multinomial probit model that  incorporates endogeneity of the variables accounting for the  deterministic component of the latent utility for the objects in  the choice set.  The context of the research is applied management  science, in particular, marketing science, where random utility  models of the type proposed are commonly used to evaluate the  effects of marketing variables such as price, promotion (e.g.  coupons), and advertising on brand choice.  The underlying  rationale is that previous research in this area has provided  potentially misleading estimates of the true effects of marketing  variables on brand choice because it has not accounted for the  endogeneity in these marketing variables.  The objective of this  research is thus to provide a method that generates consistent  estimates of the marketing variables effects and appropriate  optimal allocation of marketing resources, by constructing a model  where the endogeneity of the explanatory variables is explicitly  accounted for. These estimates will be compared with the ones  obtained through existing, single-equation methods.  The model will  be estimated using data from electronic scanners commonly used in  supermarkets and department stores.  ***",
