 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced materials, such as ceramics and composites, are being             increasingly used in various applications.  The high cost                       associated with machining and damage generated during machining are             major detriments for implementation of these materials.  In some                cases, current machining methods cannot be used and innovative                  techniques or modifications of existing methods are needed.  These              problems are being addressed by researchers in many institutions                around the world; and the results are being communicated in various             technical conferences and published in journals.  However, these                conferences and journals have a limited scope, and do not cover the             broad spectrum of the problems.  For example, machining of polymer              composites, metal matrix composites, and ceramics are covered in                different conferences; and precision machining of optical                       materials are covered in others.  Nevertheless, the main issues of              cost and reliability are the same for all advanced materials.  The              goal of this conference is to strengthen communication and                      technology transfer among researchers and engineers involved in                 various aspects of machining of advanced materials.",
