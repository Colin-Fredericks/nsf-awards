 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is part of a broad effort to determine the means by               which the human visual system processes the pattern of light                    falling on the retina, in order to determine the white, gray or                 black level of surfaces within a person's field of view.  It is                 generally accepted that perceived surface gray levels are based on              relative light intensities extracted from intensity gradients in                the retinal image, but little is known about how these relative                 intensities are anchored, that is, processed to yield the specific              shades of gray that we see.  Strictly speaking, relative                        intensities provide information only about relative shades of gray.             Absolute shades of gray can be derived only with the addition of an             anchoring rule.  For instance, in many scenes the visual system                 automatically treats the highest intensity as white.  This can be               demonstrated under the simplest conditions by placing an observer's             head inside a large dome, half of the interior of which is painted              black and half of which is painted gray.  The gray part will appear             white and the black part will appear gray, consistent with the                  highest-intensity-as-white rule.  However, if an observer's head is             placed within a uniformly painted black dome containing a white                 disk at its center, the black dome appears white and the disk                   appears luminous.  This would follow from a rule by which white is              assigned to the surrounding region, not to the highest intensity.                                                                                               In this research, human observers will be placed in a variety of                visual environments, chosen to distinguish different potential                  anchoring rules.  These will include simple patterns on large                   plastic domes that completely surround the viewer, more complex lab             displays, computer simulated displays, and on-site natural scenes.              Analysis of how the anchoring rules change as the visual field                  becomes increasingly complex may well fill an important gap in the              modelling of surface color perception.",
