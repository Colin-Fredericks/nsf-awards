The primary activity will involve                         eight week summer sessions of independent research in                           evolutionary biology. A select group of ten students, (at                       least six non-LSU students) of junior or senior standing,                       will be invited to participate in the program. Each student                     will be under the direct supervision of an LSU faculty                          member who will serve as the research mentor and be directly                    responsible for the student' s progress. Faculty                                participants have been chosen on the basis of their                             experience working with undergraduates in the laboratory,                       suitability of research projects and general research                           productivity. Additional components of the summer program                       will be an intense library orientation, communication skills                    workshop, and an honor and ethics in science seminar. The                       program will also involve a weekly seminar series for all                       participants, including the faculty advisors and members of                     their research laboratories. The latter activities will be                      coordinated by the P. I.. Upon completion of the summer                         research program, each REU investigator will present his/her                    research results as an oral paper at an undergraduate                           research symposium, and a written paper in a form suitable                      for publication. Students will be encouraged to present the                     results of their completed work to a scientific audience at                     regional or national professional meetings.  This program                       targets students in the South Central region of the United                      States, with three schools, Centenary College, Jackson State                    University and the University of Texas - Pan American to                        receive focused recruiting.",
