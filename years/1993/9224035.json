 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Bulgaria project between Dr. Irwin                                      Fridovich and Dr. Stephan Liochev is on                                         \"Oxidation Effects of the Superoxide Radical in                                 Escherichia Coli.\"  The researchers propose a                                   novel explanation for the toxic effects of the                                  superoxide radical, to account for many                                         observations already in the literature which lend                               themselves to experimental probing.  Current                                    orthodoxy views superoxide as a precursor of                                    hydrogen peroxide and as a reductant for ferric                                 ion.  The researchers, in contrast, view O2, O2                                 and H2O2 as direct oxidants and consider Fe(II),                                in its various ligated forms, to be an important                                target for these oxidants.  They have found that                                a number of \u01314Fe-4S!-containing dehydrases are                                  rapidly oxidatively inactivated by O2.  The                                     results should shed light on the mechanisms of                                  oxygen toxicity and of the oxygen-dependent                                     toxicities of viologens, quinones, aryl nitro                                   compounds and of other redox-active compounds.                                                                                                                  This project in biochemistry science fulfills the                               program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in Bulgaria                               and the United States to combine complementary                                  talents and pool resources in areas of strong                                   mutual interest and competence.",
