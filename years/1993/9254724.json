 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant will lead to a full proposal from the                       University of North Texas for a Teacher Institute which                         offers a master's degree in elementary science.  The                            planning grant will begin examining elementary science                          protocols, establish design teams to make decisions on                          content, and begin the process of redesigning existing                          university courses.  In all, 12 courses, 3 credits each,                        will be modified by the design teams.  Through this project,                    a major will be created which prepares teachers in content,                     methodology, and in their new roles as change agents in                         schools which use site based management.                                                                                                                        The planning grant begins the processes that lead to the                        Teacher Institute.  The new concentration is expected to be                     institutionalized by the end of the grant.  The University                      of Texas is cost sharing 92% of the project.",
