 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glucose is a global regulator of transcription in most organisms,               however, the mechanisms of regulation are unknown except in                     bacteria.  To begin to understand the mechanism(s) of glucose-                  regulated transcription in eucaryotes, we are examining how glucose             represses transcription of the lactose-galactose regulon in the                 common dairy yeast Kluyveromyces lactis.  This organism is well                 suited for such studies because of the molecular genetic techniques             that can be used to isolate genes and introduce mutations into any              nucleotide in the genome.  We have recently shown that glucose                  repression of the lactose-galactose regulon is mediated by a                    promoter element, URS, present in front of the LAC9 transcription               activator gene.  We hypothesize that the presence of glucose in the             culture medium is sensed and transmitted by a signal transduction               pathway that culminates with a repressor protein.  We further                   hypothesize that the repressor binds to the URS element and                     restricts transcription so that the concentration of the LAC9                   protein is below the critical level needed to activate                          transcription of structural genes in the lactose-galactose regulon.             These and related hypotheses will be examined under three Specific              Aims.   A major goal for the three year duration of this project                is to identify and characterize one or more of the protein                      components of the glucose signal transduction pathway:  The long                range goal is to elucidate the entire pathway.                                  %%%                                                                             This research project seeks to understand how the sugar glucose, a              vital molecule in animals, regulated various cellular activities                including turning genes on and off.  The effects of glucose in all              organisms are very complex which makes it difficult to sort out                 individual effects.  To overcome some of this complexity we are                 using a simple single-celled yeast as a model organism.  Such a                 model offers many advantages over more complex organisms                        particularly since yeasts can be subjected to quantitative genetic              analysis including the isolation and mutation of any of its genes.              The results of these studies should increase our understanding of               how glucose is detected by cell, how this information is                        transmitted to the cell's nucleus, and how genes are turned on and              off in the nucleus.  Such information will be essential for                     understanding normal cellular processes that we currently do not                understand and for developing cures for diseases including diabetes             and cancer.",
