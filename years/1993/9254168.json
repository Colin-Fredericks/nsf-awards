 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the overall problem of keeping students                  in the science pipeline.  The Biology Department faculty are                    providing computerized pre-laboratory exercises that involve                    students in the challenge and excitement of scientific                          investigation and discovery.  Specifically, our project                         addresses common \"roadblocks\" to learning faced by biology                      students, such as: the limitations of time and finances on the                  laboratory experience; a lack of understanding of the                           scientific process; a lack of analytical, critical thinking,                    and quantitative skills; differing cognitive styles; and a lack                 of comfort with advanced technology.  Project objectives                        include: 1) Development and refinement of computer-based                        applications, such as experiment simulations, systems models,                   data collection and analysis tools, and visual image libraries                  of organisms, preparations and dissections; 2) Expanding the                    faculty's use of investigative laboratory activities; students                  will be expected to design experiments, execute them, analyze                   data collected, and draw conclusions and generate ideas for                     further investigations; and 3) Utilizing the talents and                        experience of advanced-level biology students to help faculty                   develop and test computer applications for introductory labs,                   and to work with underclassmen on their laboratory and                          independent investigations.                                                     Working with the College's Educational Computing Services, a                    group of six biology faculty, each of whom has release time,                    are developing 12 pre-laboratory computer modules.  They are                    using the multi-media, multi-tasking capacity of the NEXT                       computer workstation and the NeXTStep development environment                   to create lessons specifically designed to meet the needs of                    students in the three introductory biology courses.                             Advanced-level students are taking advantage of NeXTStep                        development workshops held on campus so that they can assist                    faculty in applications development.  They also assist the                      faculty in the labs.                                                            We plan to use formative and summative evaluation tools to                      assess the effectiveness of this project.  An Advisory Board                    comprised of biologists from other institutions will meet at                    least yearly to monitor the program to determine whether parts                  of the program ought to be redirected, replaced or augmented.                   A summative evaluation will be conducted by this Board and by                   the Allegheny faculty.  Final project results will be                           disseminated to the Advisory Board and to other colleagues                      nationwide.  In addition, Allegheny is planning a symposium to                  mark the opening of its Hall of Advanced Biology in 1993, and                   this project and other advances in the educational uses of                      computing technology will be featured.                                          This project will help our students to discover the excitement                  of science, and it will help Biology Departments at other                       colleges which use Unix-based workstations.  Colleges that do                   not use Unix-based workstations can emulate Allegheny's                         approach by identifying roadblocks to learning and addressing                   them through interactive computer lessons.",
