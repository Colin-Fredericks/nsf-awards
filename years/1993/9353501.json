 "awd_abstract_narration": "9353501  Mansfield    The Southeastern Regional Education Service Center (SERESC) of New  Hampshire addresses the needs of twelve school districts that  include 20 elementary and 10 middle schools, representing 25% of  the states total K-12 enrollment.  With guidance from the SERESC  staff, these districts have studied their needs and created action  plans for the implementation of hands-on inquiry-based science  instruction in elementary and middle schools throughout the region.  SERESC is now planning to coordinate an important reform effort  within each district and to create a regional network of  collaborating reformers.  Two teachers and a principal from each of  these schools will receive training as instructional leaders for  science and agents of systemic change in their districts.  Teachers  will receive content instruction, evaluate instructional material  (e.g., EDC Insights, BSCS, TIMS, Microcosmos, Kids Net), construct  grade-level instructional plans, develop strategies for curriculum  integration, and design assessment vehicles.    The proposed project has the potential for substantial impact  throughout the region of southeastern New Hampshire, and it can  serve as a model for other regional consortia of small school  districts.     Cost sharing amounts to 42% of the NSF contribution.  ***",
