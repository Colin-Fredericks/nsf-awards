 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313657  Saunders  Proton transfers from acids in which the ionizing proton is   attached to carbon will be studied by quantum chemical   methods. The energies and other properties of the separated   reactants, the ion-dipole complexes, and the transition   state structures for proton transfer will be calculated for   a number of carbon acids that yield delocalized anions of   the sort widely used in organic synthesis. A study will also   be made of a prototype for oxygen acids that yield   delocalized anions, acetaldehyde enol, and a comparison will   be made to the carbon-centered acid, acetaldehyde. The aim   of the research will be to explore the factors that   influence barriers to proton transfer: acidity, heavy-atom   reorganization, charge transfer, and polarizability. These   gas-phase calculations will be compared to literature   experimental results in both the gas-phase and solution.   Calculations of isotope effects will be done on selected   systems, including deprotonation of propene by hydroxide ion   and elimination reactions in order to establish what level   of calculation is necessary to give reasonable isotope   effects, and to compare the results with experimental data   in solution.   %%%  This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the   work of Professor William H. Saunders at the University of   Rochester. The transfer of a proton from an acid is one the   most common and most important reactions in chemistry. This   work will study proton transfers reactions by computational   methods and compare the results to experimental data. The   individual factors that control the energy barrier to proton   transfer will be probed in these calculations. Deuterium   substitution, which alters the rate of proton (or deuterium)   transfer and is important in determining the mechanism of   proton transfer, will be calculated and compared to   experimental results.  ***",
