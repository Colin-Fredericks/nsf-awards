 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, confocal microscopy has been  developed                   to meet the increasing demands of 3-D imaging.  The deficiency                  of the technique is that the image data must be collected                       pixel by pixel through scanning, which makes the instrument                     slow, inefficient, complicated, and expensive.  3-D imaging                     will be realized through parallel pixel filtering techniques.                   A pixel filter array made of micro-optics can be constructed                    to perform spatial filtering for all image pixels                               simultaneously.  Only the light from the focal depth region                     can pass through the pixel filter array and the light from                      out-of-focus regions is rejected.  Sectioned images can be                      obtained without scanning.  The technique is expected to have                   better depth discrimination capability than that of the                         confocal technique.  Due to the elimination of image scanning,                  the technique will substantially increase the imaging speed,                    simplify the instrument design, and greatly reduce the costs.                   This program will lead to the development of a new 3-D imaging                  technique and may find wide applications not only to                            microscopic imaging but also to telescopic imaging.",
