 "awd_abstract_narration": "The high resolution structures of several positive-sense RNA                    viruses, both rod-shaped and iscosahedral, have now been                        determined, and the molecular events in the assembly of rod-                    shaped RNA viruses have been characterized in great detail                      through the study of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).  By                            comparison, relatively little is known about the protein: RNA                   and protein: protein interactions which direct the assembly of the              icosahedral RNA viruses.  The experiments proposed here are                     designed to determine the RNA sequence and structure of the                     southern bean mosaic virus SBMV coat protein-binding site, and to               characterize the rp-complex.  The results will provide a detailed               picture of the specific interaction between RNA and protein in the              initiation event of icosahedral virus assembly, and they will also              be relevant to the study of RNA: protein interactions in general.               In addition, the proposed experiments will directly test the models             for icosahedral virus assembly and will allow comparisons to be                 made between SBMV assembly and the assembly of another small RNA                virus, turnip crinkle virus (TVC), with the PI has worked as a                  postdoctoral fellow.                                                            %%%                                                                             Viral assembly is a key component in virus-host interactions.  This             project will contribute toward our understanding the host range and             symptom severity of this group of plant virus and the economically              important plant disease they cause.       //",
