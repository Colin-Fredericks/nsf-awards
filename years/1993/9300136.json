 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators plan to develop new techniques for                       obtaining  approximations to the performance measures of queueing               systems.  The new asymptotic and singular perturbation techniques               will be applied to a wide variety of equations, such as                         difference, integral and differential-difference equations, that                arise in these models.  The methods are based on the WKB method,                boundary layer analysis and matched asymptotic expansions.  New                 nontrivial extensions of theses methods have previously been                    developed and have been shown to yield remarkably accurate                      results.                                                                             The new approximations developed by the investigators will                 be directly applicable to models of large computer and                          communications systems.  In such systems, customers (computer                   jobs, voice messages, data packets, or video images) contend for                limited system resources.  The behavior of these systems is                     measured by performance measures such as throughput and response                time.  To design new systems, it important that analytic models                 be analyzed to assess system operating characteristics.",
