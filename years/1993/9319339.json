Similar situations may exist  with regard to major cities in the United States, such as with  the Los Angeles basin.    The main objective of this research program is to investigate, by  computer simulation, the effect of the shape of the bottom of the  basin, as defined by the bedrock-sedimentary layer boundary, on  the spatial and temporal distribution of surface ground motion  during earthquakes.  Practically all studies to date have  considered the bottom of a basin to be concave.  A recent  scientific article suggests that a bottom surface which includes  both concave and convex sections can cause ground surface motions  which are chaotic.  The effect of such a chaotic motion on the  level of ground motion experienced by engineered structures is  unknown, but it is likely to be beneficial.  This will be  explored in the context of two-dimensional sedimentary valleys  subjected to seismic excitation in the form of incident plane SH  waves.  Parametric studies will determine the difference in the  surface ground motion above a convex bottom surface as compared  to that above the usual concave shape.    This study will also consider whether small changes in valley  geometry and seismic excitation, such as the angle of incidence  of the incoming wave, can produce significant changes in the  spatial and temporal distribution of the valley response.  Such  large variations would have important implications for seismic  hazard assessment and the seismic design of structures.    ***",
