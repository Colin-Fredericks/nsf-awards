LaFrankie, Arnold Arboretum, Harvard                                            University, to complete with Mr. Hua-Seng Lee,                                  Department of Forestry, Sarawak, Malaysia, the                                  training of U.S. and Malaysian personnel                                        essential to the success of their NSF-supported                                 research on tropical biodiversity.  The                                         research itself deals with understanding how                                    tree biodiversity is maintained in balance in                                   the Lambir National Park, Sarawak, East                                         Malaysia, in the Northwest Borneo hotspot, an                                   area that may be the most species rich forest                                   in the Old World.  A special 50 hectare plot                                    has been reserved in which the role of soil                                     heterogeneity in maintaining species diversity                                  can be studied.  A possible deterrent to the                                    full utilization of this resource is the fact                                   that there are less than 10 botanists in the                                    United States, 5 in Malaysia, and only two in                                   Sarawak who are fluent in the flora of Borneo.                                  The educational objectives of the project seek                                  to widen the regional forest expertise of the                                   resident researchers and technical staff, and                                   thereby foster regional collaboration among a                                   new generation of forest scientists.                                                                                                                            Dr. Ashton is a senior researcher with an                                       excellent international reputation gained                                       through some three decades of research on                                       Bornean forests.  Dr. LaFrankie is a young U.S.                                 scientist who has been engaged in postdoctoral                                  research in Borneo.  Mr. Lee is Assistant                                       Director of Research and Reforestation,                                         Sarawak, Malaysia.  Primary research support is                                 provided through NSF Grant No. BSR-9107247,                                     with matching funds from Japanese sources,                                      notably, the Monbusho Fund and the Marubeni                                     Corporation.  This project is relevant to the                                   objectives of the Science in Developing                                         Countries Program which seeks to contribute to                                  the infrastructure of developing countries and                                  to increase the level of cooperation between                                    U.S. scientists and engineers and their                                         counterparts in developing countries through                                    the exchange of scientific information, ideas,                                  skills, and techniques and through                                              collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.",
