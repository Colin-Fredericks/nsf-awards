 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four-year project aims at establishing a county-wide                       network of secondary mathematics teachers whose ongoing work                    will be to support the teachers of Onondanga County                             (Syracuse, NY) as they introduce and maintain programs of                       modern mathematics in the county's high schools.  To these                      ends, 42 well-prepared mathematics teachers will be selected                    for a program designed to strengthen their mathematical                         background, expand their pedagogical repertory, and enhance                     their leadership skills.  The program will begin with an                        initial group of 18 teachers (2 from each of 9 schools)                         attending a 4-week residential summer institute at the                          University of Syracuse with two major foci: (1) helping                         teachers modernize their classroom instruction (e.g.                            involving their students actively in doing mathematics); (2)                    professinalizing teaching by asking teachers to reflect on                      their own classroom practices, involving themselves in                          professional societies, and the like.  Participants will                        also study mathematical content -- with emphasis on the                         importance of connections between diverse topics; solve                         (real world) mathematical problems in small groups; explore                     the uses of technology to aid in doing mathematics; create                      lessons and units for use in their classrooms; learn new and                    appropriate ways of assessing student progress in                               mathematics.  During the implementation phase in the ensuing                    academic year, project staff will lend support to the                           participating teachers in a series of 12 half-day workshops.                    In the second year, the program described above will be                         repeated for an additional 24 teachers.  Participants from                      the first summer program -- after additional training --                        will act as mentors to this second group of teachers.  In                       the third and fourth years of the project, the entire group                     of participating teachers will have formed teams (of 4 to 14                    members) to initiate and maintain implementation and                            dissemination efforts throughout their respective districts.                    Project staff will provide a variety of support for these                       efforts.  It is expected that the network of teams thus                         established will continue its work after the end of the                         grant.  Cost sharing is 30%.",
