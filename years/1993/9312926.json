 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research represents a collaborative research project               entitled \"Embryonic Stem Cell Equivalents in Zebrafish to Study                 Early Development\".  The three principle investigators are Nancy                Hopkins (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Wilbur Long                    (Western Maryland College), and Paul Collodi (Purdue).  The long                range goal is to understand early developmental processes at the                genetic level in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio.  The immediate               goal is to follow up promising new results which suggest that it                may be possible to develop an equivalent to mouse embryonic stem                (ES) cells for zebrafish.  With this technology, one can mutate                 genes by random insertion of promoter or gene trap constructs or by             targeted homologous recombination, select cells with desired                    alterations, and then generate mutant organisms from them.  The                 zebrafish would be a superb organism in which to perform this type              of mutagenesis and if successful, this approach would make it                   possible to isolate large numbers of insertional mutants affecting              the desired developmental processes as well as targeted mutations               in genes suspected of playing important roles in the processes.",
