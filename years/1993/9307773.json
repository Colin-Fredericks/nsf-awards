 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to apply the chaos theory to mixing of particle                  systems, without and with an interstitial liquid, and to develop                and experimental approach to quantify the mixture performance                   in a simple flow configuration.  Mixing of particle systems is                  significant different from mixing of fluids due to the                          segregation and secondary phenomena caused by interparticle                     interactions.  Even if mixing plays an important role in                        chemical, petroleum, mining and pharmaceutical processes, no                    reliable theory with a larger range of generality has been                      developed.  The proposed approach offers a sound background for                 developing a chaos based theory, and a simple device for model                  calibration and testing.  Several technological improvements are                expected by the introduction of various disturbances which would                enhance mixing of particulates.  The research project to be                     focused on the differences between single fluid mixing and                      particulate mixing, and on the generic aspects which can be                     obtained from the experiments on the proposed device.  The                      feasibility of the chaos theory applied to particulate mixing                   is a main goal of this project.",
