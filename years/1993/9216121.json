 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to show experimentally that the               phase of the electron spin in a two dimensional electron gas can be             manipulated to produce quantum interference effects modulating the              electrical conductivity; this effect was predicted by Aharonov and              Casher in 1984.  With the atomic strength electric fields present               in zincblende semiconductors, the Aharonov-Casher interference                  should be observable using the electron magnetic moment in a two                dimensionally confined electron gas.  The induced phase shift is                predicted to be 2-10 pi radians for realizable mesoscopic                       geometries.                                                                                                                                                     Ring geometries and Young interferometers will be defined on GsAs               heterojunction field effect devices.  The phase will be varied                  through the dependence of the electron magnetic moment upon                     electron surface density.  In zero magnetic field the observation               of oscillations in the electron conductivity, periodic in surface               electron density and of magnitude 1/(25812) mhos, will demonstrate              the validity of the Aharonov-Casher approach to the understanding               of the spin dependent properties of mesoscopic systems.  These                  experiments will be essential for predicting the role that electron             spin plays in quantum dot and ballistic transport experiments                   implemented in semiconductor heterojunctions.                                   %%%                                                                             The principles of electron transport in semiconducting solids have              been understood for a long time.  In the last decade, interference              effects illustrative of the wavenature of the electron have been                observed when very small device structures are made.  These sizes               need to be of the order of the electron wavelength, about one ten               millionth of a meter.  The fabrication technology for these quantum             devices originated in the requirements for ever smaller devices in              the computer chip industry.                                                                                                                                     The electron also carries a magnetic moment which can be                        represented as the physical observable of a spin quantum number.                The research proposed is to search for methods to manipulate the                spin phase of the electron waves such as to cause interference.                 Spin phase can change as the magnetic moment moves through an                   electric field.  Here the internal electric fields existent in                  compound semiconductors will be exploited.  The results of this                 research will assist in understanding the role of electron spin in              quantum dot and ballistic transport experiments implemented in                  heterojunctions and similar quantum device structures.",
