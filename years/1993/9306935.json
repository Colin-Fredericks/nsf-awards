 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306935  Sharp  Studies in the Principal Investigator's laboratory have shown that  accumulation of the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is required for the  maintenance of primary root elongation in maize under water-limited  conditions.  Recent evidence indicates that one role of ABA in this  regard is the regulation of proline accumulation for osmotic adjustment.   The proposed research aims to determine the cellular mechanisms  underlying this relationship.  Building upon recent data and a review of  the published work in plant as well as animal and bacterial systems, a  hypothesis is developed that ABA accumulation in the root growth zone at  low water potentials regulates membrane ion transport and intracellular  ion levels, which in turn induces mechanisms for growth maintenance  including the accumulation of proline.  While the role of ABA in  regulating ion transport in stomatal guard cells is well-established,  such information is scant with regard to the action of ABA in growth  regulation.    The primary objective is to test this hypothesis using  electrophysiological approaches, emphasizing changes in membrane  potential and ion concentrations and fluxes in the root growth zone  caused by low water potentials and manipulation of endogenous ABA levels.   Emphasis will be placed on measurements of K+ and H+.    As in previous work, endogenous ABA will be manipulated within  physiologically meaningful levels in roots growing at low water  potentials using both the inhibitor fluridone and the vp5 mutant of maize  to inhibit carotenoid (and ABA) biosynthesis.  In all experiments a high  degree of spatial resolution will be emphasized to address differential  responsiveness to ABA within the root growth zone.  Conventional and ion-  selective microelectrodes will be used to measure changes in membrane  potential, cytoplasmic ion levels and ion transport between roots grown  at high and low water potential, and in roots at low water potentials in  which endogenous ABA levels are altered.  A sol ution culture system has  been developed for this work, and preliminary experiments have shown  changes in membrane potentials in the root growth zone in response to  altered water potentials and to exogenous ABA.  The electrophysiological  measurements of ion levels will be compared with values obtained by x-ray  microanalysis (EDX).  Appropriate collaborations have been established to  facilitate the electrophysiological and EDX measurements.      Parallel to the studies of ionic regulation, the biochemistry of proline  accumulation in the root growth zone at low water potentials and as  affected by ABA will be examined.  The contributions of increased  synthesis, decreased catabolism, increased uptake, and decreased  incorporation into protein will be assessed.     The proposed research is a step toward the long-range goal of identifying  specific plant processes or traits which could be used in crop germplasm  improvement programs.  The studies should provide much needed information  in the fields of ABA physiology and root growth regulation under water-  limited conditions, which have been characterized by slow progress.   ***",
