 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves several topics in optimal stochastic                 control and nonlinear estimation. The main topic is risk                        sensitive optimal control. Risk sensitive optimal control                       provides a link between stochastic and deterministic (robust                    control) approaches to modelling disturbances in control systems.               Two player, zero-sum differential games arise naturally in the                  analysis. Risk sensitive control also involves large deviations                 theory for stochastic processes. The methods to be utilized                     include viscosity solution techniques for nonlinear partial                     differential equations. Other classes of stochastic control                     problems suggested by application in finance theory will be                     studied. In nonlinear estimation, some problems of partially                    observed random fields arising in image analysis applications,                  and hidden Markov models, will be investigated.                                      One of the main issues in mathematical control theory and in               control applications is the design of control strategies which                  are insensitive to unfavorable disturbances which may occur                     within the control system. For plants which can be modelled as                  linear control systems, there are several effective strategies                  for obtaining good system performance in the presence of system                 perturbations and a clear understanding of the connections                      between the main methods. However many, if not most, practical                  control systems, such as those required on high performance                     aircraft, are only poorly, or not at all, modelled as linear                    control systems. This project seeks to develop methodologies and                their interconnections for robust control of nonlinear stochastic               control systems analogous to those for linear stochastic control                systems.",
