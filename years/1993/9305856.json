Toeplitz matrices, in which the elements along each  stripe parallel to the  main diagonal are  constant, are  the  most  important persymmetric matrices.  Reversing the order  of  the elements  of an eigenvector  of a Hermitian Toeplitz matrix   produces the  conjugate of  the eigenvector.   A  real symmetric  matrix of  order 2n (2n+1)  has n (n+1)  linearly independent  eigenvectors such that reversing the order of their elements  leaves the eigenvectors unchanged,  and n  linearly independent   eigenvectors such that reversing the order of  the elements is  equivalent to  multiplying the eigenvector by -1.   The sets of  eigenvalues associated  with these two kinds of eigenvectors  are  called the even  and odd spectra of the matrix,  respectively.     The   polynomials  having  the  elements of eigenvectors as   coefficients are  called the  eigenpolynomials of the matrix.   The investigator studies the interlacement properties  of  the   even  and  odd  spectra of real symmetric Toeplitz matrices,  the   location  of  the  zeros  of  the  eigenpolynomials of Hermitian   Toeplitz  matrices,   numerical  solution  of   the  inverse  eigenvalue problem for real symmetric Toeplitz matrices, and   analogous problems  for  more  general  Hermitian  persymmetric  matrices and real symmetric persymmetric matrices.       Structured  matrices  of  the  kind  considered  here  have    important applications  in  statistics  and  signal  processing.    The  matrices occurring in these applications are usually very  large.  This research attempts to exploit the peculiar  structure  of these matrices in  order to solve problems in these areas  efficiently.  The main applications of the results will be  in  the area of  signal processing, the science  of extracting  information  from transmitted signals.  ***",
