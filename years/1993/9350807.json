 "awd_abstract_narration": "The laser is an indispensable tool in many fields of science                    and engineering. The University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF) is                   providing a comprehensive, undergraduate-level, one-semester                    laser laboratory course which follows an existing one-semester                  course in classical optics (with lab). Over the last several                    years UAF has accumulated a wide variety of lasers for the                      laser lab. In particular, we have an Argon ion laser, a                         flashlamp-pumped dye laser, a nitrogen laser, a nitrogen laser-                 pumped dye laser, a number of helium-neon lasers, and a Nd:YAG                  laser.This project is obtaining the final instruments which                     will allow us to offer this course to our students.  In                         particular, we are obtaining: a calibrated Joule meter to                       measure the pulse energy in the various pulsed lasers; a diode                  array for our grating spectrometer so we can measure laser                      spectra \"single shot;\" another diode array to measure spatial                   beam profiles; a diode laser to fill a hole in our laser                        inventory; a helium-neon tube with Brewster windows and a set                   of external mirrors so that the students can get the experience                 of aligning several different cavities (confocal,                               hemispherical, and flat-flat) for a fixed gain medium; a data                   logger so we can use our scanning grating spectrometer (with                    photomultiplier tube) to measure the tuning curve of the pulsed                 nitrogen laser-pumped dye laser, a set of output couplers with                  a range of transmittances for the Argon ion laser so that the                   students can see the difference in gain between the 514 nm line                 and the 488 nm line; and several pairs of safety goggles so                     that the students can safely use the Nd:YAG laser.Given the                     importance of the laser in contemporary science we are doing                    our students a great service by providing this course whether                   they choose to go to graduate school or enter the job market                    immediately.",
