 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Description (Technical):  This project will develop a              new measuring instrument, called a magnetic flux microscope, which              is based on a SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device)               sensor.  The objective is to obtain images of magnetic fields near              surfaces with a resolution at the micron length scale.  The                     instrument should be able to scan an area one centimeter on a side,             resolve features as small as 1 mm and sense magnetic fields as                  small as 10 December 22, 1992picoTesla.  The instrument will be                 able to sense currents as small as 12 picoAmperes.  The new                     instrument will be used in investigations of superconductivity, and             will address issues such as the pinning and motion of individual                vortices.  In addition, the instrument will be used to obtain                   images of a range of magnetic materials, as well as working                     microcircuits.                                                                                                                                                  Project Description (Non-Technical):  This project continues the                instrumental revolution based on surface microscopy techniques such             as scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  In               this case a new surface microscopy is being developed to sense not              atomic positions but the magnetic fields produced by the atoms and              molecules.  It will sense surface atoms and subsurface atoms as                 well.  The sol-called magnetic flux microscope will be used to                  study superconductivity, magnetism and will also be used to sense               current flow in work microcircuits.  The technique should provide               new information about the fundamental aspects of superconductivity              and magnetism and will provide a new diagnostic tool to improve                 microcircuit performance.",
