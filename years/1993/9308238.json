 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308238  Admati    Much controversy surrounds the division between ownership and  management of large corporations.  Diversified ownership confers  benefits from spreading risk, but it can dull owners' incentives to  monitor managers.  Shareholders who control a significant fraction  of the shares of a firm have stronger incentives to monitor and  control its managers; indeed, it has been claimed that the greater  concentration of ownership found in Japan and Germany has resulted  in more effective control of managers, lower costs of capital, and  (thus) greater levels of investment and efficiency than in the U.S.   The authors will investigate how ownership patterns and the  resulting patterns of monitoring management are determined as an  equilibrium, and how they affect the cost of capital, investment,  and corporate performance.  Research will study both mature,  publicly held firms whose shares are traded in well functioning  markets, and privately held firms, where the \"large shareholders\"  are venture capitalists.  The methods employed will be primarily  theoretical in nature, based on economic models of capital markets  and self-interested behavior.  This research should lead to better  understanding of the efficiency of capital markets and how they  interact with the productive sector, leading to better-informed  regulatory prescriptions.    ***",
