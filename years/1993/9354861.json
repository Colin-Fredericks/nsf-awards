 "awd_abstract_narration": "9354861  Attewell    We propose a graduate research training program in the area of  Organizational Effectiveness, within a doctoral program in  sociology, but drawing upon an interdisciplinary faculty involved  in organizational studies within the social and behavorial  sciences.    The training program is oriented toward African-American and  Hispanic doctoral students, and will involve an initial cohort of  five trainees.  Our doctoral program has successfully recruited and  graduated substantial numbers of minority doctoral students in  sociology for two decades:  we propose building up and extending an  existing sub-speciality in organizational studies to focus  specially on organizational effectiveness.  We shall use existing  recruiting bridges to outstanding minority students in the senior  colleges of the City University of New York, as well as national  searches, detailed below.    The proposed program involves a sequence of courses on  organizational theory, assessment methodologies, and research  techniques. It includes student apprenticeships in existing faculty  research projects on effectiveness and restructuring efforts in  three organizational domains: private industry, government, and  schools.  This will be followed by research internships in private  and public organizations, which will form the bases of their  dissertation research.  ***",
