 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Clemson University is               enhancing its established undergraduate research program with a                 summer component.  The Research Experiences for Undergraduates                  program will involve students from Clemson and other institutions               in a ten week program of research, seminars, and workshops.  All                of the activities will challenge the participants intellectually                and develop their critical thinking skills as well as their ability             to work independently.  The one-on-one contact with faculty and                 interaction with graduate students will also introduce these                    students to the opportunities in graduate education and the career              options in research and academia..  Fifty percent of the faculty                have participated in undergraduate research projects spanning the               areas of thermal and fluid science, mechanical and manufacturing                systems, engineering mechanics, and materials.",
