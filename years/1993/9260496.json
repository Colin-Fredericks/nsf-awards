 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on the feasibility of using                an electron beam to remove hydrocarbon pollutants from exhaust                  gases emerging from combustion processes to reduce or eliminate                 their potential for polluting air into which they are discharged.               The experiments will be conducted using an existing, pulsed                     induction accelerator to irradiate controlled gas mixtures                      containing aromatic and chlorinated aromatic organic compounds                  such as benzene and chlorobenzene.  The work plan includes                      analyses to identify the byproducts produced during radiation,                  their concentrations and the dose of radiation required to reduce               their concentration to environmentally acceptable levels..                                                                                                      Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for                   engineering design of an optimal, all-solid-state induction                     accelerator system for the reduction to acceptable levels of the                concentration of hydrocarbons in exhaust gases from combustion                  processes that are subjected to electron beam radiation.  The                   proposal leading to this award was submitted in response to NSF                 92-30, Small Business Innovation Research under Topic No. 25d,                  Environmental Systems.",
