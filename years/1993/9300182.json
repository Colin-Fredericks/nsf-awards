In Thailand, a hydroelectric reservoir filled in 1987 and left 162 rain forest fragments as islands in Chiew Larn reservoir.  Since 1990 we have monitored the effects of this habitat fragmentation on the population viability of 12 species of small ground dwelling mammals in these now isolated  habitat patches.  We find that habitat fragmentation leads to rapid local extinction and are investigating the factors causing extirpation of some species.  This entails studies of genetic variability and of inter specific interactions  between the mammals themselves and their food resources (plants and insects).  This is the first study to examine both ecological and genetic effects of rain forest fragmentation on mammals in the first decade following habitat alteration. %%% The small mammals we are monitoring serve as models of larger mammals that are usually the focus of wildlife conservation efforts and as general indicators of forest ecosystem functioning.  The project has great generality throughout the humid tropics where forests are  being fragmented by development projects and exploitation.  The policy implications of our research are that fragmented forests require intensive management if they are to provide ecological services and biological resources for future generations.   #    d   \\        P    C        P#      #    x   \\        P    C      X P#",
