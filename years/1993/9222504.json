 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metamorphosis is a developmental process that is                           characterized by changes in form and physiology of non-reproductive             structures to allow for the occupation of new ecological niches.                In amphibians, the internal and external changes of metamorphosis               occur in temporal relationships that appear to depend on a                      progressively-rising level of thyroid hormones in the blood.                    Moreover, the rate at which metamorphic events occur is also                    influenced by environmental factors such as the daily changes of                light and darkness.  Since melatonin, a hormone produced and                    secreted by the pineal gland, plays a major role in signalling                  photoperiodic changes, Dr. Wright will determine whether it                     interacts with thyroid hormone in the regulation of the metamorphic             process.  Using both in vitro and in vivo approaches, she will                  examine the influence of circadian rhythms on the reciprocal                    interactions between melatonin and thyroid hormones in the                      development of the tadpole.  Amphibians serve as primary models for             embryological and developmental studies and the vast majority of                what we have learned about the developmental biology of amphibians              is directly applicable to our understanding of human development.               Therefore, these results are likely to provide new insights into                the role of hormones in early development.  Moreover, the findings              will be related to conservation of biological diversity since                   identifying the environmental and hormonal factors that influence               development may help in understanding the recent global decline in              amphibian populations.  Dr. Wright is supervising this research                 at an undergraduate institution and, therefore, a major goal of                 this project is to introduce students into the scientific process               and to prepare them for professional scientific careers.",
