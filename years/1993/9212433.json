 "awd_abstract_narration": "This US-Czech mathematics research project on                                   Symbolic Derivation, Analysis, and Programming                                  of Finite Difference Schemes is between Dr.                                     Stanly Steinberg of the University of New                                       Mexico and Dr. Richard Liska of the Czech                                       Technical University, Prague.  Their research                                   effort will extend the current symbolic                                         techniques used to study finite-difference                                      approximations.  The researchers hope to                                        improve the existing technology for analyzing                                   truncation errors and stability, and the                                        algorithms for generating code.  Cylindrical                                    decomposition algorithms will be used to study                                  a system of inequalities that arise in a Routh-                                 Hurwitz problem obtained from the Von Neumann                                   stability condition.  Techniques for comparing                                  finite-diffence algorithms on non-orthogonal                                    grids will be developed.  The researchers will                                  pursue work with numerical diffusion and                                        dispersion, group velocities, stability of                                      boundary conditions, conservation laws, and                                     stability analysis via the energy method.  As a                                 result of their collaboration, the researchers                                  expect to extend the FORTRAN-code generation                                    algorithms to a high-performance computing                                      environment for use in study of a five-                                         dimensional Fokker-Planck equation and the                                      three-dimensional Navier Stokes equation.                                                                                                                       This project in mathematics fulfills the                                        program objective of advancing scientific                                       knowledge by enabling leading experts in the                                    United States and Eastern Europe to combine                                     complimentary talents and pool research                                         resources in areas of strong mutual interest                                    and competence.",
