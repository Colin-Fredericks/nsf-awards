 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an experimental and theoretical study on the              viscoelastic properties of blends of dissimilar polymers in the                 entangled fluid state.  Binary blends will first be prepared from               well-characterized linear polybutadienes of narrow molecular-weight             distribution and variable microstructure.  The heteropolymer                    character of these mixtures will be controlled by increasing the                disparity of the vinyl group content in the participating                       components.  Dynamic-oscillatory, steady-shear, tensile, and step-              strain experiments will be utilized in examining the linear and                 nonlinear viscoelasticity of these systems at several temperatures              as a function of composition.  The fluidity, elasticity, and                    rigidity of a blend will thus be related to the corresponding                   properties of its pure constituents.  Blends of commercial polymers             will also be investigated to test whether the conclusions drawn on              model polymer mixtures apply to cases of commerical interest.                   Especial emphasis will be given on blends where miscibility is                  driven by the presence of strong specific interactions.  A                      molecular theory already developed to explain the composite network             architecture and molecular dynamics in miscible heteropolymer                   blends will be extended to accommodate non-ideal behavior.                                                                                                      This research is part of a general format to understand better the              mixing behavior of dissimilar polymer.  A particle outcome would be             more efficient processing of recycled plastics, which are typically             mixtures.",
