 "awd_abstract_narration": "ISSAC is the premier annual conference of the computer algebra                  community.  Developing a symbolic computation system raises                     many interesting theoretical issues in both computer science                    and mathematics, and the ISSAC conferences have traditionally                   been a meeting ground for implementors and theoreticians.                       Furthermore, as symbolic computation systems have become more                   sophisticated, their users have responded by employing them in                  more complex ways.  The ISSAC meetings have provided a                          scientific forum for beneficial interaction between the                         designers of symbolic systems and the users of them.  So not                    only are the theoretical computer scientists and systems                        implementors present, but so are very mathematically                            sophisticated physicists, engineers, astrophysicists,                           geophysicists, and other mathematical scientists.                                                                                                               This grant is to support the travel of American students and                    researchers to participate in this conference.",
