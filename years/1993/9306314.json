 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306314 Shaw          Parasitoid wasps of the genus    Aleoides    are among the most commonly encountered rogadine Braconidae (Insecta: Hymenoptera), particularly in temperate parts of the Holarctic region.  These wasps are remarkable in that the host caterpillar remains mummified, thus naturally preserved for study.  Since a wide variety of caterpillars are attacked, the tribe is a particularly promising study group for analysis of patterns of host utilization by parasitoid wasps.  The purpose of this research is to complete a cladistic analysis of world species of    Aleoides   , which can be used to interpret patterns of host utilization by these wasps.  The requested funds will be used to support a graduate student who will assist the PI with specimen preparation, handling, data gathering, data entry, and scanning electron microscopy.  Additional funds are requested for scanning electron microscope (SEM) studies and supplies.  This research will result in a phylogenetic classification, which will provide the framework for an examination of patterns of host utilization.  It additionally will render the Rogadini more accessible to continued research in parasitoid ecology, behavior, physiology and biological control. %%%          This project will examine the relationships of species in a large genus of wasps that are parasitic as immatures, feeding on a variety of caterpillars many of which are pests of forests and crops.  The study should result in a sound, modern classification of these beneficial wasps.  Such a classification will be of use for further studies in the behavior, ecology, and host utilization of these wasps and should aid applied efforts to use the se wasps as biological control agents of various pests, thereby diminishing use of noxious chemicals for insect control. ***",
