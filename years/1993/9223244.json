 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  is  an award under the Grants for Improving  Doctoral               Dissertation  Research  program.   It  is  a  study  of   factors               explaining how Mexican immigrants do better than members of other               ethnic groups in the New York City labor market.  Interviews will               be  conducted  among  ethnic Korean and  Greek  owners  of  small               businesses  about  their  employment practices  and  reasons  for               preferring  to  hire  workers from Mexico.  In  combination  with               interviews  carried out among Mexican workers,  these  data  will               make  it possible to describe the labor market niches and  social               networks  that  have fueled the rise in immigration  from  Mexico               into the New York area recently.                                                                                                                                      The  proposed  research will help  to  shed  light  on  the               formation  and  maintenance  of  an  underclass  in  contemporary               American  cities and show the social mechanisms by which  members               of  some ethnic groups managed to escape from the underclass.  As               such  this  project  has the potential to contribute  toward  the               amelioration of a serious social problem in American society.  In               addition  to the scientific gains to be achieved by the research,               this  award will materially assist a highly promising student  in               completing  research  for  the  Ph.D.  dissertation.    Thus   it               contributes to the future scientific manpower of the  nation  and               the   thorough  training  of  the  next  generation   of   social               scientists.",
