Earlier studies in this field tended  to focus on the effects of candidates' party affiliations,  incumbency status, and competitiveness on the allocation of PAC  contributions.  More recent studies have gone on to study the  relative importance of more detailed characteristics of  congressmen, especially their committee and subcommittee  assignments, party and committee leadership positions, seniority,  and roll-call voting records.  A primary goal of the latter group  of studies has been to determine the extent to which various PACs  contribute disproportionately to members and chairmen of the  committees and subcommittees whose policy jurisdictions are of most  concern to the PACs.    Overall, the findings regarding PAC-committee relationships are  mixed.  One likely reason for these mixed results is the inherent  difficulty in guessing which PACs should be attracted to which  committees.  In studies to date, the researcher postulates a priori  the committes that are \"relevant\" to a particular PAC or set of  PACs.  In most cases, however, the choices are not so obvious, and  the researcher is forced to make subjective judgments.    In this research investigation, the researchers avoid making  specific assumptions about which committees are relevant to  different PACs or types of PACs, by taking a dynamic view of the  problem.  They examine the effects of changes in representative's  committee and leadership assignments on changes in the pattern of  PAC contributions received by the representative.  The underlying  assumption is that if PACs tend to favor certain committees, then  a representative who switches committees, or who moves into a  leadership position on a committee, will tend to see more changes  in the pattern of his contributions than a representative who does  not change committee positions.    A  further advantage of the dynamic approach is that the researchers  can distinguish between \"adding\" and \"dropping\" PACs.  If it is  important for PACs to develop and maintain long-term relationships  with representatives to achieve their goals, then there may be a  tendency for PACs not to \"abandon\" representatives to whom they  have contributed in the past, even representatives who move off the  committees that the PACs consider to be most relevant.    The research investigation covers campaign contributions to races  for seats to the U.S. House of Representatives, for the election  cycles of 1979/80 through 1987/88.  ***",
