Institutions may have two distinct effects:  1) the specific  institutional arrangments that make a particular democratic system  affect performance.  Democracies are not all the same and what they  are matters for how they perform. 2) the effect of economic crises  on the survival of democracies depends on the particular  institutional arrangements.  Democratic stability is not just a  matter of economic, social or cultural conditions because specific  institutional arrangements differ in their ability to process  conflicts, particularly when these conditions become so adverse  that democratic performance is experienced as inadequate.    Which democratic institutions work and last under what conditions?   By \"work,\" the researcher means that they generate economic growth,  material security, freedom from arbitrary violence, and other  conditions conducive to the full development of individuals.  By  \"last,\" the researcher means that they absorb and effectively  regulate all major conflicts, that rules are changed only according  to rules.    The purpose of the investigation is to examine statistically the  simultaneous effect of alternative democratic institutions on  performance and of performance on the durability of democracy under  alternative institutional frameworks.  Two data sets will be used:   one consisting of all countries with the population over one  million which were independent by 1965, and the second consisting  of a smaller group of, principally European and Anglo-Saxon  countries for which long-term data are available.    The results of the project will provide empirical data on effective  institution building strategies for new democracies.",
