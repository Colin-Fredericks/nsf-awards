 "awd_abstract_narration": "9217481  Nakanishi  As part of an ongoing maintenance of the Research Facilities  in the Department of Chemistry at Columbia, this proposal  seeks the purchase of a 500 MHz multinuclear NMR  Spectrometer.  In this Department such equipment is needed  by several groups.  Nakanishi has elucidated the structures  of over 160 bioactive compounds, many of them unstable and  available in only microgram quantities.  In recent years  most NMR studies belonging to compounds in this category  have been performed elsewhere because of inadequate  instrumentation in this department.  However, the nature of  almost all the work being conducted in his group recently  i.e., in biopolymers and the ultraminuscule scale structure  determinations, makes the availability of an on-site high-  field NMR instrument absolutely essential.  His group has  focused on the development and application of spectroscopic  methods to structural studies; the proposed instrument will  finally enable him to do the important NMR work here at  Columbia.  We have recently added two young faculty members  who specialize in biopolymers, Professors Horne and  McDermott, and the instrument will be essential for their  work.  Specifically McDermott's work has concerned ligand-  protein interactions with large protein receptors, such as  soluble domains from photosynthetic reaction centers, using  both solid state and solution NMR.  Existing instrumentation  at Columbia is both inadequate and too heavily used for her  to continue the solution state portion of these studies  here.  Horne has been very active in the area of triple  helix formation of DNA, and is also working in the area of  RNA-protein interactions.  The research efforts of Professor  Still, Breslow, Katz and Turro have been hampered by the  fact that they have effectively abandoned structural  analyses of certain exciting systems only because they are  not well resolved on antiquated equipment.  Other members of  the synthetic organic and inorganic group, for example,  Gilber t Stork, and others, will also make use of the  instrument as research requires.",
