Comparative studies indicate that the ANT-C and BX-C are derived  from a single ancestral cluster which arose very early in animal  evolution; descendants of this ancestral cluster can be recognized  in all higher animals which have been examined including mammals,  where the included genes also play roles of great developmental  significance. The focus of this project is a study of the evolution  of the regulative functions of these homeotic genes by comparing  Drosophila to Tribolium castaneum, the red flour beetle. Beetles  and flies diverged about 300 million years ago and in many  morphological and developmental aspects beetles are relatively more  primitive. Most important is the fact that Tribolium can be used  for genetic analysis with resolution approaching that possible with  Drosophila. This project is directed toward that portion of the  Beetle ancestral cluster which resembles the ANT-C of Drosophila.  We will 1) define all necessary genetic functions in the ANT-C-like  region by saturation mutagenesis and describe the resulting  phenotypes 2) molecularly clone this region 3) determine the  temporal and spatial pattern of expression of these genes and 4)  elucidate the nature of the interactions of these genes with one  another and with upstream and downstream genes.  %%%  Studies of the genetic mechanisms controlling developmental  commitments during embryogenesis are among the most active and  significant in biological research. These studies should contribute  to insight into that process as well as to a better understanding  of the evolution of mechanisms controlling such regulatory  networks.  ***",
