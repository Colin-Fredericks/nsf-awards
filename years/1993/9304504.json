 "awd_abstract_narration": "Layered ice deposits found in shallow saline lakes in southern                  Bolivia and northern Chile may provide the first high-resolution                record of climatic change from the arid-subtropical region of the               Andes.  The ice deposits rise as much as 7 m above the surface of               shallow saline lakes and extend to unknown depths.  The deposits                are covered by a white carbonate crust and the layers alternate                 between freshwater ice and ice mixed with sediment.  The sites are              located in a very arid region (<100 mm a.1 mean annual                          precipitation) where mean annual temperatures range from 3.6o to                9.6oC.  The deposits are presently melting, which indicates they                are not in equilibrium with the modern climatic regime.  Ice cores              will be retrieved from the ice deposits beginning with the largest              deposit, which is found in Laguna Colorada (22o10'S,4289m), to                  determine the potential of these deposits as archives of high-                  resolution climatic change.  A transect of cores across the                     deposits will indicate whether or not the layers are horizontally               continuous.  The cores will also provide the material for isotopic,             chemical, and mineral analyses, which are needed to determine when              and how the layers formed.  Mono-pulse radar soundings will help to             determine how thick the deposits are and the potential need for a               mechanical drill to obtain a long record.  High lake levels and                 glacial advances indicate there was a significant change in the                 hydrologic budget in the subtropical region of the Andes during the             late Pleistocene.  This change was probably caused by two factors:              a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, which                  lengthened the rainy season, and colder temperatures.  Pr1eliminary             results indicate that the layered ice deposits may have started to              form during this late-Pleistocene interval and therefore could                  provide a unique record of climatic change for this region.",
