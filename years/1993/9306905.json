 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Bauer - 9306905    The method presently used to convert methane to liquid fuels is based on the Fischer/Tropsch process.  This is environmentally undesirable and relatively inefficient.  In general, methanol as a motor fuel is not attractive because of the energy intensive process used to produce it.  An alternative is a possible homogeneous pyrolysis and oxidative mechanism for methane conversion which would introduce an inexpensive initiator that generates copious levels of H, O, or OH radicals at temperatures well below that required for C-H bond fission, and addition of a component that induces branched chains for additional initial rapid radical production.    The PIs plan to experimentally test a thermal conversion mechanism under homogeneous conditions, that appears attractive based on an extensive computer analysis of the chemical kinetics processes that occur during co-pyrolysis of methane with selected radical initiators, at relatively modest temperatures.  Specifically, they plan to validate a pyrolysis process in flow-tube reactors operated in the 800 to 900 SYMBOL 176 \\f \"Symbol\" C temperature range and 5 to 30 atmospheres operating pressures, using free-radical initiators derived from highly branched alkenes or alkanes, commixed with the methane, at approximately 1% levels, concurrently with added 1 to 2% oxygen.  Two types of experimental tests will be undertaken to validate the process and to measure product distributions developed in bench-scale trials: (1) the use of a \"wall-less\" laser heated reactor, and (2) tests using \"bomb\" experiments. Various operating conditions will be explored to  optimize conversions to desirable higher molecular weight hydrocarbons.         !   & # $ % ' v ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 @ 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; < = > ?
