Sommese to                work on the applications of algebraic geometry to numerical                     analysis and problems in linkages.  In particular problems arising              from the theory of over-constrained mechanisms.                                      The research is in the field of algebraic geometry, one of the             oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which blossomed to the              point where it has, in the past 10 years, solved problems that have             stood for centuries. Originally, it treated figures defined in the              plane by the simplest of equations, namely polynomials. Today, the              field uses methods not only from algebra, but also from analysis                and topology, and conversely it is extensively used in those                    fields, but it has applications to many areas of engineering as                 well.  The research supported in the present proposal shows the                 importance of this once purely theoretical area for robotics and                manufacturing.",
