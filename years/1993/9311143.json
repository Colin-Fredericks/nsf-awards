 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311143  Schlesinger    The proposed research makes use of a rather unusual freshwater swamp  ecosystem on the North Carolina coastal plain which is flooded and drained twice-  daily due to tidal forcing.  In these forests, the flooding regime is essentially  uncoupled from seasonal patterns of soil warming.  I propose to monitor the major  cycling pathways for CH4 in situ over a one-year period to determine if sources  and sinks respond equally to elevated temperatures.  Seasonal studies have rarely  considered both production and oxidation of CH4.  The field data will be compared  to the temperature response characteristics of methane production and oxidation  as determined in the laboratory.  This study will show if the temperature-limited  step for oxidation is enzymatic, implying a large increase with soil-warming, or O2  diffusion implying a smaller response.  Finally, I propose to determine the  potential for CO2-fertilization and elevated temperature to synergistically increase  methane flux through increased root productivity and root exudation.  Such  positive-feedbacks have important implications for modelling trace gas emissions  under various climate change scenarios.  %%%  There is legitimate concern that elevated CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere  will increase CH4 emissions from wetlands.  Elevated CO2 may stimulated  methanogenesis directly by increasing plant production or indirectly by increasing  soil temperature.  ***",
