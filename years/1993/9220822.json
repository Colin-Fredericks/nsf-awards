 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research evaluates how attached aquatic microflora                    (periphyton) regulate (1) the rates of deposition of organic                    carbon that is imported from upland areas or synthesized by                     aquatic plants and algae in these regions , and (2) the retention               or loss rates of organic carbon.  The microbiota accomplish this                regulation by a combination of intensive  decomposition of                      dissolved organic carbon to CO2 and methane and by burying a                    significant portion of microbial biomass that does not decompose.               High metabolism and growth results from intensive recycling of                  nutrients within the communities.  The research program will                    examine natural communities under replicated experimental                       conditions for:  (1) Metabolic and community carbon retention and               decomposition to CO2 and methane in response to substratum.  (2)                Resistance to nutrient limitations of phosphorus and nitrogen and               the effects on carbon losses.  (3) Effects of different types of                dissolved organic compounds on metabolic recycling and carbon                   losses.  (4) Determination of lateral microscale fluxes of                      nutrients within these attached communities.                                    %%%                                                                             Wetland/ littoral and floodplain land-water interface regions of                lake and river ecosystems are being recognized as major                         depositional areas for organic carbon.  Organic carbon storage                  versus evolution of metabolized carbon in the form of CO2 and                   methane is important because these 'greenhouse' gases are                       critical to global climate change evaluations. ***//",
