 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of an intense artificial X-ray source for geophysical              and well logging procedures to determine strata formation density,              lithology, and composition is desirable over 1-2 Ci level sources               of l37 Cs or 60 Co.  An accelerator based photon source reduces the             radiological handling risk and the considerable expense of down                 hole loss.  In Phase I, North Star Research successfully                        demonstrated operation of a innovative 200 kV, 400  A (beam                     current) Nested High Voltage (NHV) accelerator and the production               of radiation.  Notable characteristics of this device were the                  small diametric size (10 cm), mass (13.6 kG), and the capability                for higher voltage operation (constrained only by the Phase I drive             power limitations).  North Star proposes to incorporate                         enhancements in accelerator internal design, drive power                        optimization, and electron beam control into a package that                     produces at a minimum 0.663 keV, 100  A beam suitable for intense               radiation production and nuclear logging.  The embodiment of the                proposed NHV resulting from a funded Phase II effort would                      immediately compete with other logging systems employing l37 Cs.",
