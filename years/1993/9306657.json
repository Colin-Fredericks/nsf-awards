 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant-feeding insects are generally not uniformly distributed              among host plants or within individual hosts.  Instead, certain                 hosts, and sites within hosts, are preferentially attacked by                   insects.  The timing of feeding within a growing season is also                 frequently circumscribed.  Determining the extent to which theses               feeding preferences are correlated with insect survival and                     fecundity is crucial to understanding what factors trigger and                  terminate periodic outbreaks of insects.  The proposed research                 will examine interactions between a leaf-mining moth and its                    quaking aspen host trees in northern Minnesota, where the moth                  frequently reaches outbreak densities.  Experiments will test                   whether miners preferentially feed at particular sites within                   leaves, or on leaves on particularly large and/or rapidly growing               shoots and branches, as some current theory suggests; if the                    distribution of feeding over the growing season is correlated with              herbivore performance; and whether aspen trees develop resistance               to herbivory as they mature.                                                    %%%                                                                             Outbreaks of herbivorous insects occur both in natural & human                  dominated ecological systems.This research addresses pivotal                    questions concerning how natural temporal and spatial variation in              foliage quality influences herbivore performance & potential for                population outbreaks.  It details the extent to which high                      herbivore density results in the use of inferior resources, an                  important component of the population dynamics of plant-feeding                 insects.  In addition, the results will have important implications             for management of stands of quaking aspen, a commercially valuable              tree species.",
