 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project in the Physical Chemistry Program of the                        Chemistry Division, Prof. Gina Hoatson of the College of                        William and Mary will engage in developing new techniques of                    pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in order                   to expand the accessible range of time scales over which the                    rates of molecular motion as well as the associated dynamical                   trajectories can be determined.  These include methods of                       selective inversion, the determination of double quantum line                   shapes, methods of  Hadamard excitation spectroscopy, which is                  a variant of stochastic NMR possessing considerable advantages                  over conventional pulsed NMR, and spectral density measurements                 on powders.  Systems to be investigated in the course of this                   work include molecular crystals, inclusion compounds, and                       liquid crystals.                                                                %%%                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a powerful,                    ubiquitious method for the study of solids and liquids through                  the interaction of nuclear magnets of the constituent atoms                     with electromagnetic radiation.  The absorption of this                         radiation by the nuclear magnets is not only characteristic of                  the specific chemical element but is also affected by the                       chemical environment.  The atomic nuclei thus act as                            microscopic probes and yield site specific information about                    the structure and dynamics of the solid or liquid substance.                    Continual developments in theoretical and experimental                          techniques have resulted in vastly improved performance of the                  NMR method as a tool for basic studies of the properties of                     condensed matter and have greatly expanded its application to                   problems in physics, chemistry, materials science, biology, and                 medicine.  In this project further developments are planned to                  enable the NMR method to deal with difficult or so far undoable                 problems and thereby extend the range of its applicability to                   practical problems.",
