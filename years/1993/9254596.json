The                project also will offer seminars and specific dissemination                     activities for mathematics educators to learn about this                        approach.                                                                       The 2 1/2 year project will produce 18 written teaching cases and               accompanying teaching notes on a range of 5-12 mathematical                     concepts identified by researchers and practicing teachers as                   particularly difficult to teach -- including especially those                   areas where human intuition often fails the mathematics student.                Teams comprised of teacher educators and mathematicians from                    Harvard University, the University of Massachusetts, Boston and                 the University of New Hampshire and practicing teachers will join               to develop, pilot and revise the case materials.                                The (MCDP) Project will have a potential impact on novice                       mathematics teachers, with a possible extension to experienced                  mathematicians and mathematics teacher educators, and the larger                teacher education community.",
