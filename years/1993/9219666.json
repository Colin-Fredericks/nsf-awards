 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, which will begin its tenth year of support from the               NSF, addresses one of the critical questions in developmental                   biology: how do aa relatively small number of embryonic cells give              rise to the multitude of cell types that make up the individual?                An ideal model system in which this question can be addressed is                the neural crest, which appears very early in the development in                all vertebrate species.  Although the neural crest is only                      recognizable for a few days during the course of development, it                gives rise to a myriad of important structures in the body.  Among              the hundreds of neural crest derivatives is the entire peripheral               nervous system, all of the pigment cells in the skin and the cells              that make the dentin in the teeth.  How are such an enormous number             of diverse cell types made from a seemingly homogeneous population              of cells in a normal individual?  With previous NSF support, this               laboratory devised sophisticated cell sorting techniques for                    isolating and studying subpopulations of neural crest cells.                    Furthermore, they can transplant neural crest cells and follow the              transplanted cells throughout development.  The current studies                 will specifically examine how individual neuronal cell types arise              from the neural crest by examining the development of two                       identified subpopulations following transplantation.  The events                that direct apparently homogeneous neural crest cells to become                 specific neurons will be examined, and the specific control genes               that are associated with these events will be identified.  These                studies are at the interface of cellular and molecular biology,                 where, for the first time, it is now possible to address one of the             most fundamental questions in developmental neuroscience.",
