 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hongming will continue his study of noncommutative harmonic                analysis.  This will include an investigation of generalized                    hypergeometric functions on matrix spaces, domains of positivity,               and Hermitian symmetric spaces, concentrating on developing the                 operator-valued theory, extending the context to include Siegel                 domain of type II, deriving Mellin-Barnes representations, and                  exploring applications to infinite-dimensional representation                   theory.                                                                              The mathematical bedrock of Hongming's research is the                     theory of Lie groups.  Named in honor of the Norwegian                          mathematician Sophus Lie, these groups have been one the major                  themes in twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical                   vehicle for exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                 representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself, particularly in analysis and number                    theory, and upon theoretical physics, especially quantum                        mechanics and elementary particle physics.DMS-9200774 Hongming.                      Hongming will investigate the natural Dirichlet form                       operator over loop spaces associated to Brownian bridge measure.                The particular interest is in proving existence and uniqueness of               ground states of the associated Schroedinger operators over                     homotopy classes.  This is a continuation of Hongming's recent                  work on logarithmic Sobolev inequalities on loop groups which has               many implications for the representation theory of Lie groups.                       The theory of Lie groups, named in honor of the Norwegian                  mathematician Sophus Lie, has been one of the major themes in                   twentieth century mathematics.  As the mathematical vehicle for                 exploiting the symmetries inherent in a system, the                             representation theory of Lie groups has had a profound impact                   upon mathematics itself and theoretical physics, especially                     quantum mechanics and elementary particle physics.",
