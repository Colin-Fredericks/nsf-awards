A new course in geophysical methods,  taught in the field and directed towards local problems suitable  for undergraduate research, is being developed.  Five systems are  being incorporated into the course: 1) a portable 12 channel  seismograph, 2) magnetic equipment for susceptibility, total field  and vertical gradient measurements, 3) an electromagnetic induction  system for near surface conductivity mapping, 4) a global  positioning system to extend our gravity work into the surrounding  mountains, and 5) a generic MS/DOS computer with graphics software  to facilitate data analysis and presentation.  Electrical  resistivity equipment, a gravimeter, a field computer, and modeling  and interpretation software also are being used in the course.  All  of the equipment also is being used for senior thesis research, and  the gravity, magnetic and seismic equipment is being integrated  into labs for the honors course in introductory geology.  The focus  of the geophysics methods course is to geophysically characterize  the Missoula aquifer which is the sole source of Missoula's  drinking water. The aquifer is recharged by the Clark Fork River  which drains the nation's largest collection of EPA superfund  sites.  Significant ground water and geochemical research has  focussed on contaminant, water quality, and water abundance  problems. Geophysical studies are greatly benefitting this  research; geophysically the aquifer is poorly known.  This  situation is providing an excellent natural laboratory for  obtaining data that is publicly important and of ample scope for a  long term research project and for dissemination in the  professional literature.",
