 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306485  Simon  In this project in the Experimental Physical Chemistry program  of the Chemistry Division, John Simon will apply a variety of  experimental techniques to investigate the photochemistry of  chlorine oxides and nitrogen oxides in solution in order to  determine information about their gas-phase behavior.  The  photodynamics will be followed by time-resolved electronic and  infrared absorption as well as electronic emission.  Samples  will be examined in polar and inert nonpolar solvents as well  as in optically transparent glasses.  The PI will interact with  scientists at other research institutions in order to develop a  more complete understanding of the photoreactivity of these  species.  %%%  Many chemical reactions give different products when they take  place in a liquid phase than the same reactions do in the gas  phase.  This work will help determine the effect of solvents on  chemical reactivity.  These solution-phase studies will also  offer a means of determining in a controlled manner the  chemical behavior of atmospherically important chemicals under  the influence of light source such as the sun.  As a result of  these investigations our understanding of tropospheric and  stratospheric photochemical processes will be enhanced.  ***",
