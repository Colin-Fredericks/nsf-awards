 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to analyze the consequences                      of presuming firms choose their plant size so that they can                     service their seasonal fluctuations in demand before they know                  whether overall annual demand will be high or low.  At issue, is                whether capacity precommitment results in firms seeking smoother                seasonal fluctuations in production during a boom.  In order to                 examine this question, a model is developed and tested with                     seasonally unadjusted data in contrast to the usual approach of                 utilizing adjusted data.  The findings will have a number of                    important implications.  Among other things, the fact that                      seasonal and cyclical fluctuations interact implies that standard               seasonal adjustment procedures typically used in most studies                   provide misleading results.  This implies, in turn, that attempts               to date business cycles using standard seasonally adjusted data                 are likely to understate the length of expansions.  Furthermore,                the findings may have important implications for the  nature of                 industry-level cycles.  This project will also analyze how well                 small firms fared during historical episodes of financial unrest.",
