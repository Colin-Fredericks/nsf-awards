 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic                   Program provides support to Dr. Cynthia K. Schauer of the                       Chemistry Department, University of North Carolina at Chapel                    Hill, for synthesis of linear oligomers of small                                metal-phosphorus clusters.  The clusters generally contain five                 atom frameworks of iron and phosphorus with carbonyl ligands.                   A variety of synthetic strategies will be used to form metal                    bridged, phosphorus-phosphorus bridged, and organic group                       bridged chains.  The reactions take advantage of the reactivity                 at the phosphorus atom when hydrogen or trialkylsilyl groups                    are removed from that site.  The properties and reactivities of                 the resulting oligomers will be investigated, with the goal of                  providing models for the reactivity of polymeric chains.                        Synthesis of longer chained species or chains containing                        phosphorus cubanes will also be attempted.                                      %%%                                                                             This study attempts to find synthetic procedures for the                        construction of linear chains containing phosphorus and metals.                 The project is a synthetic challenge and is of fundamental                      interest.  Utility may lie in the extent to which shorter                       chain, and therefore more easily characterized, molecules                       reveal the properties of longer chain polymers built from the                   same connecting units.  It is possible that these compounds or                  their analogues may have interesting electronic properties.",
