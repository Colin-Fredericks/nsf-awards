 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this study is to compare process related to               CO2 storage (ie photosynthesis and accumulation of soil C and CO2               release (ie. plant respiration and decomposition) for evergreen and             deciduous forests in two contrasting boreal climates and is part                of a large international study (BOREAS) to examine terrestrial                  atmosphere interactions in boreal ecosystems in Prince Albert                   National Park, Saskatchewan and nelson House, Manitoba, Canada.                 Data collected during the study will increase our understanding of              the influence of major biotic and abiotic factors on carbon cycling             in boreal forests.  A concurrent activity will be to develop                    computer simulation models that we will use to examine the                      influence of different climate change scenarios on the growth of                boreal forests.                                                                 %%%                                                                             The global carbon cycle recently has been the focus of much                     research in an attempt to explain the rising atmospheric CO2                    concentration; CO2 is of interest because it is a major greenhouse              gas.  Forests can be a net sink (ie. store CO2), a source (ie.                  release CO2) or in equilibrium (ie. no net change) depending upon               stand age, stand vigor and climate.  Boreal forest comprise                     approximately 25% of the total forested area in the world and                   contain greater than 40% of the total world soil carbon; therefore,             this forest biome is likely to have an important role in the global             carbon cycle.  Moreover, the role of boreal forests in the global               carbon cycle may change more in the future than any other biome                 because general circulation models that are used to predict future              climate suggests that the boreal biome will experience the greatest             change in climate.",
