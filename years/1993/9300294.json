 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to continue a successful Research                     Experiences for Undergraduates Site program in the                              Department of Biological Sciences at the University of                          Missouri-Columbia.  The program is designed to provide                          research opportunities for students from primarily                              undergraduate institutions. The Department  will work in                        partnership with a select group of such schools, including                      three minority institutions and a women's college, to                           provide their students the kind of research experience only                     available at a major comprehensive research university. This                    REU program will also complement and partially supplement an                    internship program for MU students funded by the Howard                         Hughes Medical Institute.                                                                                                                                       This program follows the successful completion of a Summer                      1990 prototype project, funded by the University and a grant                    from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and  1991 and 1992                     NSF-REU site grants. Faculty participant's research programs                    center on the theme \"Cellular, Molecular and Genetic                            Approaches to Biological Problems,\" and utilize methodology                     ranging from recombinant DNA technology, to                                     immunocytochemistry, to sophisticated electrophysiology. All                    participating faculty are personally involved in their                          research projects, are well-funded, and have a history of                       successful partnerships with undergraduate interns.                                                                                                             The research experience is the cornerstone of the summer                        program. Multiple and varied opportunities will be provided                     for the students to develop their communication skills, and                     mentors will help students present their research at local                      and regional scientific meetings. Finally, a number of                          enrichment activities have been developed including seminars                    by research faculty, informal evening programs, and a panel                     discussion on graduate schools.",
