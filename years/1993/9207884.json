 "awd_abstract_narration": "The influence of tropical squall lines on weather ranging from             local to global is now being recognized by the meteorological                   community.  Accordingly, observational studies that have focussed               on tropical squall lines have been held off the north coast of                  Australia in recent years.  The Principal Investigator will                     capitalize on already collected data by using a three dimensional               cloud model to investigate the vertical latent heating profile of               deep precipitating tropical mesoscale convective systems.                            Several considerations lend significance to a modeling study               of latent heat release in tropical squall lines in this area.  For              instance:                                                                         o  Tropical convective latent heat release strongly influences                both local rainfall and synoptic to global circulation features                 such as the Walker cell, a zonal arm of the global circulation over             the tropical Pacific, with convection over northern Australia and               the neighboring maritime continent normally forming the upward                  branch;                                                                           o  The Darwin area is uniquely equipped, both in geographical                 location and in coverage by radars and rawinsondes, for close                   observation of the convection that feeds the Walker cell;                         o  Darwin area squall lines occur in a wide variety of kinematic              and thermodynamic environments, in terms of available buoyant                   energy and low-level wind shear as well as other potentially                    important modulators of convective mode.",
