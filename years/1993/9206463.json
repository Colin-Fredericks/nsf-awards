 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on the changes in chromatin structure               that result from the phosphorylation of specific sites on histone               H2A molecules in higher plants. Changes in histone H1 and H2B                   phosphorylation are known to alter histone binding to DNA in animal             cells, and, as a consequence, the resultant chromatin structure. It             is reasonable to suspect that the phosphorylation of multiple SPKK              motifs near the C-terminus of wheat chromatin H2A histone may alter             chromatin structure by neutralizing large, highly basic regions of              the protein. The experimental plan will provide information on the              levels of H2A phosphorylation at various stages of the cell cycle               and test whether the SPKK motif serves as a substrate for the M-                phase protein kinase known as p34cdc2. A series of reconstitution               experiments will show how histone H2A, at various levels of                     phosphorylation, affects DNA binding and chromatin structure in                 higher plants.                                                                  %%%                                                                                Changes in chromatin structure are widely viewed as being                    extremely important during periods of gene expression, and at                   specific points during the cell cycle when chromosomes condense and             decondense. This project is focused on how the phosphorylation of               specific motifs present in the histone H2A molecule change during               the cell cycle in higher plants and how this change in histone                  charge affects DNA binding and resultant chromatin structure.",
