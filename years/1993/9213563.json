 "awd_abstract_narration": "Civil Engineering structures are subjected to short duration                    dynamic loads due to vehicle impact, ice impact on bridge piers and             off shore oil platforms, debris impact during storms or                         earthquakes, pounding during earthquakes, projectile impact from                failed rotating machinery, accidental or intentional explosions,                and many other sources.  The present equipment request is aimed at              augmenting a unique large scale outdoor pendulum test facility                  dedicated to studies on the response of structures to short-                    duration dynamic loads.  The existing facility was completed in                 1989, and is capable of testing full-scale structures.  However,                this facility does not have an appropriate data acquisition system              and its use is significantly curtailed by weather conditions.  The              requested equipment will enable the researchers to develop a                    smaller indoor testing facility for precise parallel studies on                 small-scale models of the prototypes tested in the outdoor                      facility.  furthermore, the advanced data acquisition system could              be employed also for large scale tests.  The combination of                     accurate full-scale and reduced-scale experimental studies will                 enable the researchers to develop scaling and loading realm of                  structural behavior.  Fundamental  treatment of material and                    structural response under short duration dynamic effects would be               combined for precisely defining resistance mechanisms and their                 contributions to observed structural behavior. ***",
