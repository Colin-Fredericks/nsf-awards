 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stevens Institute of Technology is offering a three-year                    teacher enhancement program to provide intensive training and                   support during summer and academic year workshops for 40 mentor                 teachers from 13 New Jersey school districts, who will in turn                  provide inservice programs for more than 300 teachers in their                  local schools.  The purpose of the project is to improve student                achievement in pre-algebra, and geometry in grades seven through                ten.  The project will utilize state-of-the-art software as a                   catalyst for teacher change toward a more constructivist and                    active learning environment.  The project is built on four years                of research and development.                                                                                                                                    Cost share provided by the university and the schools is 687% of                the award.//",
