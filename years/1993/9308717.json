 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308717  Atack  The purpose of this collaborative project is to collect the  remaining farm and household data from the federal censuses of  agriculture and population for a sample of 140 rural townships  across the northern half of the United States, and to assemble  from them a panel database covering a vital sector of the  American economy at a crucial juncture in time.  The data will  form a critical link between a cross-sectional sample from these  same communities that was drawn over twenty years ago and a  similar cross-sectional sample that is now being completed.   These cross-sections cover a thirty-year period for tens of  thousands of farms and hundreds of thousands of individuals.   They provide one of the most detailed and comprehensive views of  economic and social interactions in rural America and the  outcomes of the decisions made by individual farmers.  Among the  questions that will be addressed using these panel data are  agricultural's adaptation to change in competition, the scale and  scope of markets resulting from reductions in transportation  costs, and changes in international trade policies; the changing  structure of farms and farm ownership; and the consequences of  rural to urban migration upon rural areas.  This research is  important because it will offer new insights into the development  of the American economy at a critical period of its history, and  it will produce a valuable database for economists, demographers,  rural sociologist, and other scholars interested in economic  growth and development and rural to urban migration.  ***",
