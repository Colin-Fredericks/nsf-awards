 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan studies of the cell biological basis of learning and memory             in Octopus vulgaris.  Octopus with 108 nerve cells has a highly                 developed brain.  It is able to learn to learn to discriminate                  shapes visually and textures by touch.  We believe that learning is             accompanied by growth cone activity as in developing brains                     reawakened on a limited scale as learning occurs.  As essential                 feature of growth cones is the extension of finger-like processes               <0.5 um in diameter (filopodia) that can develop into new synapses.             Their growth depends on actin polymerization.  We have shown by                 electron microscopy (EM) that filopodia are present in learning                 neuropils in octopus and increase with touch learning and that                  cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization blocks touch                  learning with a decrease in filopodial numbers.  We have shown by               electron microscopy (EM) that filopodia are present in learning                 neuropils in octopus and increase with touch learning with a                    decrease in filopodial numbers.  Conversely nerve growth factor                 facilitates touch learning.  We have found a protein in octopus                 brain, like one in Helisoma, antibodies to it to see if it blocks               touch learning and causes decreased filopodial counts.  NO synthase             inhibitors block LTP in rat hippocampus and we have evidence that               they block touch learning in octopus, which we will pursue.***//",
