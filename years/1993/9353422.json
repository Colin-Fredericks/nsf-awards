 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's  principal Hispanic constituency-based organization, seeks  funding from the National Science Foundation's Informal  Science Education Program for a four-year community-centered  demonstration program.  Project EXCEL-MAS, the Math and  Science component of its EXCEL-MAS is designed to develop and  encourage the adoption of supplemental math and science  programs for at-risk Hispanic elementary and middle school  students and their parents, using thematic, hands-on  approaches; and ultimately help to increase the numbers of  Hispanic student enrolling and succeeding in paths which lead  to advanced study in math and science.         Hispanics -- the youngest and fastest-growing major U.S.  population, numbering 22.4 million or 9% of the U.S.  population according to the 1990 Census -- continue to be most  undereducated major U.S. population.  Only about half of  Hispanics are high school graduates, and fewer than one in ten  have completed college; only about one-quarter of high school  graduates have followed curricular tracks including the math,  science and language arts needed for college attendance;  national studies suggest that Hispanic 17-year-olds on average  have math and science skills at the level of White 13-year-  olds.  Contributing to these problems are a lack of culturally  appropriate, meaningful parent involvement or family-wide  approaches to education, supplemental programs to motivate and  support at-risk students, wrap-around social services for low-  income students and their families, and efforts to promote  more equitable Hispanic access to the full school curriculum.  ***",
