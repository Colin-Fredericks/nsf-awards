 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a nine-month visit to Japan by a                U.S. investigator, Barry LaBonte of the University of Hawaii,                   working under the direction of the principal investigator,                      Kenneth Lang of Tufts University, to participate in ground-based                and theoretical support of the Japanese solar satellite, Yohkoh.                Dr. LaBonte will be working with three primary Japanese                         investigators:  Yutaka Uchida, Professor of Astronomy, Tokyo                    University; Professor Yoshiaki Ogawara, Institute of Space and                  Astronautical Science (ISAS); and Tadashi Hirayama, Professor and               Director of the Solar Physics Group at the National Astronomical                Observatory of Japan.                                                                                                                                           The Yohkoh satellite was launched in August, 1991 by ISAS.  It                  has an expected lifetime of more than three years.  The goals of                the Yohkoh mission are the study of energetic phenomena in solar                flares and the study of the thermal and magnetic structure of the               nonflare corona.  The X-ray imagers and spectrometers on the                    Yohkoh spacecraft provide uniquely detailed and complete                        information on the corona itself.  Observations from ground-based               instruments of the underlying photospheric magnetic field and                   chromospheric structure are also essential, however, for the most               comprehensive understanding of the critical science questions.                  Dr. LaBonte will work on three specific topics:  large scale                    events, flare emission spectrum, and heating of corona.  The data               from the satellite, currently the only solar observatory in                     space, will provide the basis for many solar research projects in               the United States and Japan.  It also provides an opportunity for               significant advances in our understanding of the physical                       processes that govern solar flares and the corona in general.                    //",
