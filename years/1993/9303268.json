 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetic relationships of the basidiomycete family                     Polyporaceae will be investigated using DNA and amino acid sequence             data.  Sporocarps in the Polyporaceae range from simple, resupinate             forms, to complex, pileate-stipitate forms.  Hymenophores may be                poroid, lamellate, toothed, etc.  This study will inform the                    interpretation of fungal morphological evolution by providing a                 phylogenetic context.  The principal focus is on: (a) the roles of              morphological elaboration, reduction, and convergence in sporocarp              evolution, (b) patterns of switching between hymenophore types.                 Evolution and homology of decay types and mating systems will be                similarly elucidated.  Sampling of diverse genera, with special                 attention on type species, will contrast traditional and modern                 concepts of the Polyporaceae.  Two sources of molecular data will               be utilized: mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA genes and                nuclear-encoded vacuolar ATPase B-subunits.  Emphasizing cladistic              methods, phylogenetic analyses of the two regions will permit                   independent corroboration of gene trees used to interpret                       organismal phylogenies.  Results from unconstrained phylogenetic                analyses will be compared with those obtained under user-defined                topological constraints, enabling a quantitative evaluation of                  competing taxonomic and evolutionary hypotheses.                                %%%                                                                             To date molecular phylogenetic studies of the fungi (with 1.5                   million species, the most speciose taxon after the insects) have                been quite limited, making this study an important one since a                  comprehensive phylogenetic classification for the group is                      presently lacking.  Some preliminary data are available for the                 Polyporaceae, which are hymenomycetes (fungi that bear their spores             on an exposed hymenium).  Polypores and other wood decay fungi play             a significant role in global carbon cycling and cause great losses              in the timber industry.  The information derived from this research             will be of practical use in studies of wood biodegradation because              it will clarify results of homology and function in wood rot                    organisms.",
