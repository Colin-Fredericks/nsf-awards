 "awd_abstract_narration": "Baker 9309948     Pheromones are chemical compounds secreted for the purpose of  chemical communication, with a well-known example being the  airborne odorants secreted by female moths to attract males from  great distances.  Insects detect pheromones by specialized receptor  cells in the antenna that are considered to be among the most  specific chemosensory receptors known.  But in some moth species,  the female emits extra compounds considered redundant components  along the with active pheromone itself, and males have some  receptors sensitive to pheromones that also are sensitive to  compounds not emitted by their own females.  This project combines  neurophysiology, anatomy and behavior to pinpoint the neuronal  basis for the behaviorally expressed olfactory redundancy, and to  explore how specific attractant odors from plants also may modify  the response to attractant pheromones at both the cellular and the  behavioral level.  This system provides a unique opportunity to  clarify how odor blends of different compounds can apparently smell  similar to an animal, and how the chemical context of an odor  affects the response to that odor.  Further, the presence of mutant  strains with changed pheromone blends allows considering how the  reduncancy allows an evolutionarily important flexibility to the  communication system.  This work will clarify how the olfactory  connections within the brain are organized to handle mixtures, and  so will have an impact on chemosensory studies in general.  The  work also will clarify aspects of the evolution of chemical  communication, and because this species is a significant crop pest,  will have impact on agricultural use of insect control.   ***",
