 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this \"high-risk, high-payoff\" research is to                     develop, and make known to the research community, a new approach               to modeling aging, degradation and fracture of polymers.  This will             be accomplished by performing some preliminary research using novel             tools of geometry and analysis that are evolving from the                       relatively new mathematical fields of fractals and fraction                     calculus.  The PI will attempt to formulate a new, encompassing                 field theory, \"fractal continuum mechanics,\" that can be used to                bridge size scales in the study of the mechanics,\" that can be used             to bridge size scales in the study of the mechanics of materials.               This formulation will allow for the introduction of morphological               features at scales finer than the usual macroscale at which                     ordinary machine and structural analysis and design takes place.                It is necessary to take such \"micro\" features into account in order             to more thoroughly understand (and, thereby, more precisely model)              aging, degradation and fracture of materials.",
