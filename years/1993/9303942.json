 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Burger and his                    colleagues will conduct a technical analysis of pottery excavated               at the archaeological site of Machu Picchu which is located in the              Andes mountains of Peru. Discovered by Hiram Bingham in the early               1900s, this is one of the most spectacular Incan sites and is                   visited by large numbers of tourists each year. However despite                 it's fame and extensive excavations conducted by Bingham, it is not             well understood how the site functioned and what purpose within the             Incan empire it served. Through ceramic analysis Dr. Burger will                address this question. He will take a sample of ceramic materials               and subject them to combined scanning electron microscope (SEM) and             electron microprobe examination. With the former technique he will              gain insight into the manufacturing process and this will allow him             to determine the degree of standardization. The latter technique                will permit him to determine the elemental composition of the paste             and allow Dr. Burger to infer whether it derived from one                       geographical source or many. On this basis he can begin to                      reconstruct the economic and political context in which these                   essential materials were distributed and produced.                                                                                                              The Inca peoples created an empire which spread from Ecuador to                 Argentina and from the heights of the Andes mountains to the arid               Pacific coasts. Lacking both writing and a centralized market                   system they were able to integrate large numbers of disparate                   peoples into a single political system. Archaeologists wish to                  understand how they were able to accomplish this and how the Incan              system developed. The study of pottery in what is clearly an elite              context should provide insight.                                                                                                                                 In addition to the knowledge this research will provide about Incan             prehistory, it is important because of the methodological                       contribution it will make. Although the combined SEM electron                   microprobe is currently used in geological studies it has not been              applied an archaeological contexts. If it is successful it may                  greatly simplify ceramic analysts' work. Dr. Burger's research                  constitutes a first practical test and the methodological                       implications are considerable.",
