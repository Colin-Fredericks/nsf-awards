 "awd_abstract_narration": "Individual organisms with high levels of genetic variation                 often show superior physiological performance in contrast to                    individuals with lower levels of genetic variation.  It has proven              extremely difficult, however, to predict the precise environmental              circumstances under which high genetic variation is related to                  superior abilities.  This is in part due to a lack of understanding             about the interaction between environmental, genetic and                        physiological effects, and also to a lack of understanding about                the specific mechanisms responsible for these relationships.                         This project will examine the interaction between                          environmental stress, genetic variation and performance in a model              population of earthworms.  Earthworms were chosen because of their              short life cycles, their availability in the large numbers                      necessary for this work, and their importance in terrestrial                    ecosystems.  Experiments will involve both short term (one                      generation) and long term (many generations) of environmental                   stress.  The proposed mechanisms responsible for the phenomena will             be investigated using genetic experiments.  This will be the most               extensive characterization of the relationships between genetic                 variation and physiological performance in any organism to date.                The research will help to identify genetic attributes common to all             species that promote optimal performance under environmental                    stress. //",
