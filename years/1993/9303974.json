 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work focusses on the growth and processing of aluminum                     nitride (AlN), a technologically important III-V compound, by                   metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD).  The adsorption,                decomposition, and thermal stability of a series of                             alkylaluminum and alkylsilylaluminum compounds are investigated                 on selected substrates.  The derivatized substrates are                         subsequently reacted with a nitridant gas (ammonia or hydrazine)                to promote precursor formation; the precurser is then reacted                   further to form two-dimensional oligomers of AlN.  Energetics                   and intermediates at each stage of the deposition process are                   probed with both high-pressure and ultrahigh-vacuum surface                     analysis techniques.  Objectives include the requirements for                   ordered growth at low substrates temperature, use of modified                   substrates as templates for site-selective adsorption, more                     facile nitridant gases, and the advantages of using alkylsilyl                  leaving groups in MOCVD.                                                                                                                                        Aluminum nitride (AlN) possess a wide Fermic band gap, high                     thermal conductivity, high refractivity, chemical inertness, and                a good thermal match to silicon; these properties make it an                    ideal material for electronic packaging.  It also has                           application in passivation layers, dielectric layers,                           piezoelectric films, and nonelectronic applications.  This study                of improved deposition technology for AlN could also have                       applicability to other materials desired in thin-film form.//",
