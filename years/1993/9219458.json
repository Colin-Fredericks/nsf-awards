 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Thomas Hester, Mr Jeffery Huebner, a                 graduate student at the University of Texas, Austin, will collect               data for his doctoral dissertation. Mr. Huebner has amassed and                 will submit prehistoric skeletal, tissue, fecal, animal and plant               samples to Geochron Laboratories for carbon and nitrogen isotopic               determination. The results will permit him to do two things: 1.                 reconstruct how prehistoric diet changed in the Chihuahuan Desert               region over a time interval when the enviroment shifted markedly.               2. allow refinement of a set of isotopic techniques widely used                 by scientists to reconstruct human diet.                                                                                                                        Past research has shown that different animal and vegetable foods               vary in their isotopic composition in both carbon and nitrogen.                 These \"isotopic signatures\" are transmitted, with some                          alteration, to the tissues of animals which consume them.                       Analysis of human skeletal material for example shows isotopic                  variation which is related to diet over the course of an                        individual's life. Because of this fact, and because human                      skeletal material is often preserved, anthropologists have                      increasingly used this technique in an attempt to reconstruct                   prehistoric diet. Because of its dry environment and the                        excellent preservation of organic remains, the Chihuahuan Desert                provides a unique opportunity to help to develop this technique.                Not only are well dated human skeletal remains available, but                   both mummified tissues and fecal remains are also present.                      Analysis of all three allow an interesting comparison since soft                tissue reacts differently than bone and reflects diet over a                    shorter time interval. Because plant and animal remains are well                preserved, analyses of them provides a control against which                    tissue results can be calibrated.                                                                                                                               This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                our understanding of how humans adapt to a difficult and changing               environment. It will help to develop a technique of widespread                  anthropological use. It will also assist in the training of a                   promising young scientist.",
