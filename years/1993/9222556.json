 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to evaluate the state of                      the art of geophysical techniques for use in civil                              engineering applications, and to identify areas that need                       additional development.                                                                                                                                         Geophysical methods provide a theoretically sound                               means of measuring the mechanical properties of soil and                        other civil engineering materials.  An attractive feature of                    these methods is that they are nondestructive, and often                        non invasive.  There have been several important                                developments in geophysical methods in the past decade.                         Many recent developments have been made possible by                             the increased power and availability of computers.                                                                                                              Three areas of focus are: (1) Existing analytical  and                          numerical methods for wave propagation in near-surface                          soils and other engineering materials; (2) new                                  applications of geophysical methods in civil engineering;                       and (3) to summarize the availability, distribution and                         documentation of software, so that engineers can benefit                        from recent software developments.",
