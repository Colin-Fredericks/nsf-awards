 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to equip a classroom for the                  purpose of conducting closed laboratories for CS1 and CS2                       courses.  The equipment requested includes IBM compatible 486                   microcomputers and support hardware and software such as Novell                 Netware, a laser printer, Microsoft WIindows, and Turbo                         Pascal.The laboratory exercises conducted in this classroom                     will follow the model for introductory programming labs which                   has emerged in the literature.  However, these labs will be                     interactive in the following sense:  A GUI shell program will                   guide students through the tasks and activities of the lab,                     providing access to required resources such as compilers and                    demonstration programs.  Students will interact with this shell                 in the standard way, via controls such as icons, buttons,                       menus, etc. The proposers believe this new environment will be                  significantly more engaging and stimulating for the student,                    aiding the recruitment and retention of potential majors in                     Computer Science.  Each shell program would be a free-standing                  Windows application, and thus can be used as is by instructors                  at other institutions.The authors propose development of an                     object-oriented framework to support the quick and efficient                    coding of these lab shell applications.  This framework would                   capture the design of the shell applications as well as the                     model upon which they are based.  With minimal knowledge, other                 instructors could use the framework to develop interactive lab                  exercises customized to their own student body and interests.                   Moreover, the framework could be used to devlop lab exercises                   for other CS courses also. Thus, this lab framework would                       represent a significant contribution to instructional                           technology.",
