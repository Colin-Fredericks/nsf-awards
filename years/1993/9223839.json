 "awd_abstract_narration": "Between the 1870's and the appearance of A. Robinson's                          extraordinary work, \"Non-standard Analysis\" in 1961, there emerged              a large, diverse, technically deep and philosophically pregnant                 body of consistent (non-Archimedean) mathematics of the infinitely              large and infinitely small.  Unlike non-standard analysis, which is             concerned with providing a treatment of the calculus making use of              infinitesimals, most of the former work either focused on geometry              and the concepts of number and magnitude, or grew out of the                    natural evolution of such discussions.  Moreover, whereas non-                  standard analysis derives its arithmetic content from an                        exceptionally narrow, albeit an extremely important, subclass of                the class of real-closed ordered number systems, the former work                deals with arbitrary ordered number fields as well as with ordered              general conception of numbers great and small, as well as with                  ordered number systems having failures of communitivity,                        associativity, etc.  This so-called non-Archimedean mathematics                 thereby reveals a more general conception of numbers great and                  small, as well as a richer theory of the infinitely large and                   infinitely small.  This body of work, published under the rubric                The Theory of Non-Archimedean Geometric and (Totally) Ordered                   Algebraic Systems has continued to grow in recent decades producing             a number of major accomplishments including J.H. Conway's work on               Surreal Numbers.                                                                                                                                                In this project, Dr. Ehrlich aims to provide a detailed sketch of               the historical development of this largely ignored but                          philosophically important subject, and to develop a number of the               philosophical implications of its results for the concepts of                   number, the infinite, the infinitesimal, and the continuum, as well             as for a number of issues in the philosophy of measurement and the              philosophy of space and time.",
