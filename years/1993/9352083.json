 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352083  Armstrong  Brigham Young is developing an environment both physically and  pedagogically which will bring the capabilities of technology  into direct and frequent contact with large numbers of calculus  students. The vision is to involve a specific, well planned,  well organized and well managed computer lab component into the  two different reformed calculus settings as well as the  traditional calculus setting which currently exist at BYU.  The plan involves student centered projects in calculus which  will be carried out regularly (weekly) but independently of the  students' particular course enrollment. The pedagogical portion  of the plan involves designing, producing, and cataloging of  well thought out, insight provoking projects which can be  implemented through technology. In addition to the hardware and  software (projects), they are training a cadre of dedicated and  intelligent teaching assistants who are assisting students in  the laboratory setting in ways consistent with the  instructional aims of the mathematics programs.  A large number of the calculus students at Brigham Young are  mathematics education majors. A primary goal of the project is  for prospective teachers to be exposed directly to examples of  the best pedagogy in the use of technology.  In particular,  they will implement the NCTM standards on the use of technology  in the mathematics classroom in their calculus classes. It is  planned for all prospective teachers to take one of the reform  calculus courses.   ***",
