 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the work of               Professor Dearden at the University of Texas at Arlington. The                  study will investigate the intrinsic molecular recognition                      properties of crown ethers and related ligands for metal and                    molecular ions in the gas phase using ion cyclotron resonance and               tandem mass spectrometric techniques. The specific areas concern                (a) the identification of chemical systems which exhibit                        recognition effects, (b) the measurement of host-guest affinities,              and (c) the investigation of the rates and mechanisms of gas phase              recognition reactions. Subtopics that will be studied are (a) the               effects of varying the cavity size and the number and types of                  ligand donor atoms, (b) intrinsic reactivity of naturally occurring             ionophores, and (c) chiral recognition in ion-molecule reactions.               %%%                                                                             The results from Professor David D. Dearden's gas phase study on                the interaction between crown ethers and metal/molecular ions will              complement data available on molecular recognition in solution and              will thereby enable the differentiation between intrinsic and                   solvent effects. The study also addresses chiral recognition and                includes naturally-occurring, biologically-active ionophores                    (molecules facilitating ion transport through membranes). The                   outcome of this research will enable an identification and                      characterization of cage-type reagents which react selectively on               the basis of size and shape.",
