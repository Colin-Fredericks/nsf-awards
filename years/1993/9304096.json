 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304096  Hapner    This research involves the molecular biology and protein structure  of the agglutinin (lectin) present in the hemolymph of the  grasshopper, Melanoplus differentialis.  Insect agglutinins are  defense response molecules that are a component of invertebrate  immune mechanisms.  They act as surveillance molecules and take  part in the recognition and neutralization of non-self substances  including metamorphic debris and pathogenic microorganisms.   Primary objectives of the work are:  determination of the  nucleotide sequence of the cDNA encoding the agglutinin protein;  determination of the number of genes coding for the agglutinin and  their expression and induction; and the extension of known  physicochemical characteristics of the 70 kD agglutinin dimer,  including its amino acid sequence, molecular homogeneity, subunit  identity, and carbohydrate recognition properties of individual  carbohydrate-binding domains, of which there are two per  polypeptide chain.  The overall aim of the research is to  characterize grasshopper agglutinin as a defensive surveillance  molecule exhibiting broad carbohydrate recognition potential.   Methods to be employed include molecular cloning and nucleotide  sequence determination of agglutinin-encoding CDNA from grasshopper  fat body, Southern analysis of genomic DNA and Northern analysis of  mRNA isolated from several grasshopper tissues, both naive and  immuno-stimulated.  Physicochemical characterization will include  affinity chromatography on glucosidic and galactosidic Sepharose  columns, reducing and nonreducing SDS polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and reverse phase high  performance liquid chromatography.  Protein carbohydrate will be  determined by treatment with endoglycosidases.  Individual  carbohydrate recognition domains are to be proteolytically excised  from the 35 Kd monomer subunit and their binding characteristics  studied by affinity electrophoresis.  Subunit identity or  nonidentity of the 70 Kd  dimer will be confirmed by partial amino  acid sequence of CNBr or tryptic fragments generated from the  purified 35 Kd monomer.  These results should determine whether or  not the dimer represents one gene product or two, with consequent  implications for carbohydrate binding diversity.  %%%  Insect agglutinins are defense response molecules that are a  component of invertebrate immune mechanisms.  They act as  surveillance molecules and take part in the recognition and  neutralization of non-self substances such as debris left after  metamorphosis and pathogenic microorganisms.  The goal of this  research is to understand the structure and function of the protein  agglutinin (lectin) present in the hemolymph (blood) of the  grasshopper.  Increased knowledge of invertebrate immune mechanisms  and their potential vulnerability will contribute to the rational  development of insect control methods, and will also enhance  methods for management and culturing of beneficial invertebrate  organisms.***",
