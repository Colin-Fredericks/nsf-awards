 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to The Center for Biology at the                      University of Wisconsin - Madison to support a summer                           program which provides research opportunities to talented                       minority undergraduates in cellular and molecular biology.                      Ten students will be recruited nationwide in order to                           encourage and prepare them for graduate studies.. UW-Madison                    will sponsor 4 additional students, bringing the total                          involvement to 14.                                                                                                                                              Building on expertise gained from three previous summer                         programs for minority undergraduates, prospective faculty                       mentors and program staff will provide an environment                           designed to foster critical thinking, creative problem                          solving, and productive research skills. Twenty-four                            committed faculty (18 having mentored in previous summers)                      will lead in the design, planning, implementation and                           evaluation of the summer program. The core of the program                       lies in individual, independent research experiences under                      the mentorship of faculty members with shared research                          interests in cellular and molecular biology. Research                           experiences will be augmented by a seminar/workshop series                      to promote growth as independent researchers and prepare                        students for graduate study. The capstone experience will be                    a symposium in which students formally present research                         results to colleagues and faculty. The program will                             integrate multicultural and social activities, which are                        vital for providing the students with a productive,                             enjoyable and satisfying summer research experience.",
