 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is strong theoretical evidence that the Madden-Julian (30-60              day) oscillation in the atmospheric is due to interactions between              convection and circulation.  The PI will study the characteristics              of these interactions in a fully nonlinear general circulation                  model with an ocean covered earth (\"aqua-planet\").  Preliminary                 experiments with the model show strong eastward propagation at                  periods between 10-15-days.  The oscillation is equatorially                    trapped with maximum amplitude in the upper troposphere.  The                   disturbances appear to exhibit both Kelvin and Rossby wave                      characteristics, possibility suggesting that the disturbances are               coupled Kelvin-Rossby waves.  The hypothesis has been put forth                 that the vertical profile of convective heating defines the phase               speed of propagation observed in the model and the real atmosphere.             It is suggested that interacting vertical modes excited by the                  diabetic heating lead to propagating wave-CISK modes.  The PI will              critically examine this hypothesis in the \"aqua-planet\" general                 circulation model.  The preferential excitement of the slowest                  modes over the warmest waters in the observations is inadequately               explained by the hypothesis.  The PIs will also study the                       sensitivity of oscillations to zonal asymmetries in the sea surface             temperatures.  The spatial scale of the convection is very small                whereas the oscillations in the circulation occur on the planetary              scale.  Finally, the PIs will study the zonal scale selection and               the coupling between the rotational and divergent kinetic energy by             an analysis of the model energetics in the wave number domain as a              function of time.  It is expected that the proposed research will               provide a better understanding of the characteristics of the                    interactions between convection and large scale atmospheric                     circulation.",
