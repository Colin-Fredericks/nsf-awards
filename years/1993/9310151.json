 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310151  Allara    Correlations of structure and chemistry at molecular and polymer  interfaces will be generated for two types of materials systems:   1) flexible chain molecules and polymers adsorbed as thin films at  solid surfaces and 2) inorganic films, specifically metals,  deposited (in vacuo) onto molecular and polymer surfaces.  All  correlations will be driven to be as quantitative as possible by  the use of well-defined substrates prepared from self-assembled  monolayers with precisely controlled arrays of selected functional  groups and by the application of advanced, quantitative  characterization tools, sensitive to molecular features at the  monolayer-submonolayer level.  The key concept of a pinning  lattice, defined as the specific array of sites upon which  adsorption or nucleation takes place when an interface is formed,  interrelates the experiments with the above two systems and will  guide the course of this work.  In the case of flexible chain  molecule adsorption, correlations will be developed which relate  the in-plane arrangements, dictated  by the pinning lattice, with  the chemical bonding (potential well depth) and the associated  dynamics of mobility of the adsorption (pinning) sites with the  out-of-plane structures which develop in the adsorbed (self-  assembled) chain assembly phases.  These correlations will be  unified by the development of a simple theoretical framework which  will focus on attempts to describe the distribution of free volume  (defect configurations).  In the case of the metal atom deposition  (in-vacuo), correlations will be developed which relate the  nucleation (pinning) site (functional groups) distributions and  their chemistry (metal-organic) to the morphology of the metal  films.  This particular effort will focus on experimental in-vacuo  deposition studies, monitored by insitu infrared spectroscopy, x-  ray photoemission and spectroscopic ellipsometry, but also will  include limited theoretical studies in collaboration with others.     The expected outcome of the above efforts is the development of a  coherent framework, both theoretical and experimental, for  designing widely varying, precisely defined functionalized  monolayers and for understanding the adsorption/chemisorption  properties over a wide range of adsorbates from near-equilibrium  molecular adsorption to highly exothermic metal atom chemisorption.   The research will be designed to efficiently relate these results  to practical materials science issues involving polymer surface and  interface properties such as adhesion and wetting and to  metallization of polymers.  ***",
