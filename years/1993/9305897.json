Resolution of this question is important to the  maintenance of biodiversity and the conservation of rare and  endangered species.  The study will be completed on a desert spider  system which shows evidence of high levels of mating between  populations that inhabit markedly different selective environments  (i.e., abundant prey and high predation vs low prey and low  predation).  Interpopulation mixing (gene flow) and selection  (predation pressure by birds) will be manipulated in a series of  experiments to investigate the nature of the interaction between  them.  Transplant experiments will also be completed to determine  the degree to which different behavior types from the respective  populations suffer when introduced to a foreign habitat.  The  movement and assortative mating patterns of the different  behavioral types recorded in the study will be quantitatively  compared with the predictions of an individual-based simulation  model of the system.%%%       Spiders, by their nature, have proven to be excellent tools  for study of this and other ecological and evolutionary problems.   They are readily and adequately sampled because they are present in  large numbers and are not disturbed by the human observer.  They  also can be easily manipulated without disruption of their  \"natural\" behavior.  This is a major problem when using the higher  animals.  Finally, spiders perform many of the behaviors and  exhibit adaptations characteristic of these higher animals, but in  a less complex, and thus, more analyzable form.  It is from model  systems such as this one, that science has traditionally drawn to  unravel the most complex mysteries of the biotic universe.***",
