 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry Department is implementing an extensively revised                 sequence of introductory courses at the freshman level, along                   with major revisions in its laboratory experiments throughout                   the four year curriculum.  Modern instrumental techniques are                   being discussed in freshman classes and introduced into the                     laboratory at appropriate times.  In order for magnetic                         resonance techniques to become an integral part of this                         sequence of laboratory experiments, a 300 MHz broadband FT NMR                  spectrometer is being added to the available equipment.                         Background for NMR is being introduced at the freshman level by                 focusing on the concept of equivalent nuclei during the                         discussion of bonding in organic compounds, and the NMR itself                  is being used by all organic chemistry students.  A series of                   coordinated experiments are being used as stepping stones in                    the development of NMR in the lab curriculum, beginning with                    the traditional structural identifications in the 2nd year,                     progressing through more sophisticated multi--pulse and 2-D                     experiments, including a molecular dynamics study and multi--                   nuclear use, and culminating for many students in the                           utilization of the NMR in their senior research projects.",
