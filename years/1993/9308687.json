 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308687  Wright  Under his previous NSF grant, the investigator used search theory  to formalize the transactions role of money.  This was an  important contribution because it allowed analysts to rigorously  study the way preferences, production possibilities, technology  and market frictions shape the pattern of trade.  Work using a  search-theoretic approach to money demand is providing many new  insights into money's function and the relationships between  money and real variables.  This project will develop a new line  of bargaining monetary models of search and price formation,  introduce credit into search models of money.  The project will  continue research on the microfoundations of \"who meets who and  how\" that are behind the entire search framework, on an  evolutionary approach to search models of money, and on money  with private information.    The research on price formation addresses an important criticism  of existing models of money demand.  These models are incomplete,  in the sense that while they analyze the exchange process, they  neglect the determination of prices.  Either these models assume  that prices are fixed, or they assume that objects are  indivisible and therefore must trade one-for-one, or they impose  some other ad hoc assumption on prices.  The framework developed  under this project has explicit bilateral bargaining over prices,  so that monetary exchange rates are not assumed but derived from  the model.  The development of these models will permit the  systematic study of the way the underlying strategic environment  affects money and price formation.  ***",
