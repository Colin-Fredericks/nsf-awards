 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Milwaukee School of Engineering is in the process of                        curricular revisions and developments that will place a major                   new emphasis on photonics and sensors in engineering and                        physics. An important part of this program is the development                   of a Photonics and Sensors Laboratory in the Electrical                         Engineering Department. A new laboratory sequence for Optical                   Electronics and revisions of Sensors and Fiber Optic Technology                 are planned. The Senior Design Project sequence will now                        encourage more projects in sensors and photonics. This project                  will provide significant improvements in the education of our                   upper division students in Electrical Engineering, Electrical                   Engineering Technology, and Manufacturing Engineering                           Technology. To a lesser extent this laboratory will also                        support the Mechanical Engineering (and Technology) curricula.                  The major equipment requested includes fiber optic apparatus to                 demonstrate a broad variety of optical and communication                        principles. The optical time domain reflectometer and optical                   power meters will support both photonic and sensor                              experimentation. Vibrating and optical angular rate sensors and                 piezo-film kits will provide the basis for studying motion-                     sensing systems and phenomena. The sequence and content of the                  experiments, as well as the instrumentation, were selected to                   optimize the student's advancement, building upon their prior                   applied optics foundation.This laboratory's impact is expected                  to result in undergraduates who are literate in the areas of                    photonics and sensors, and should serve as excellent                            preparation for graduate work. During off-hours, we expect to                   use the laboratory to teach and demonstrate photonics and                       sensors to middle and high school science teachers, and also                    during Open Houses to help attract students into science and                    engineering.",
