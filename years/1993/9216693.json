 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Chemistry at Columbia University will use                     this award for the purchase of an upgrade for two electron spin                 resonance (ESR) spectrometers.  Both instruments are capable of                 acquiring ESR spectra in steady state operation and in                          time-resolved ESR experiments.  Fourier transform (FT) ESR                      methods will also be implemented.  Both instruments will be                     equipped with lasers capable of providing nanosecond pulses for                 excitation of samples and the production of paramagnetic                        transients.  The instruments will be used by members of the                     department for a wide range of work and will be used for a                      variety of state-of-the-art experiments including:                                                                                                              1) Gas phase experiments employing time resolved laser flash                    photolysis to investigate the possibility of employing                          circularly polarized light to produce electron spin                             polarization of reaction products;                                                                                                                              2) Low temperature experiments which investigate the magnetic                   characteristics of novel materials;                                                                                                                             3) Room temperature solution experiments which employ time                      resolved methods to investigate electron polarization transfer                  for organic triplet states and radicals in order to elucidate                   the mechanism of electron exchange between paramagnetic                         species; and                                                                                                                                                    4) Low temperature electron spin echo envelope modulation                       (ESEEM) experiments to investigate photosynthetic reaction                      centers.                                                                        %%%                                                                             An electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is an instrument                  used to obtain information about the molecular and electronic                   structure of molecules.  It may also be used to obtain                          information about the lifetimes of free radicals which are                      often essential for the initiation of tumor growth and/or a                     variety of chemical reactions.",
