 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference on The Biology and Chemistry of Vision is part             of an important series of meetings convened to promote interactions             between the top investigators in the field on topics at the                     forefront of research on photoreceptors and the retina of the eye.              This particular conference will focus on interactions between work              on the basic biological mechanisms of photoreception in the eye                 and the clinical problems related to retinal degeneration.  The                 conference will lead to new understanding of how the proteins                   involved in the biochemistry of vision can be defective, and how                those defects can lead to visual disability.  The impact will be on             both basic and applied aspects of visual neuroscience, and the                  conference will promote interactions that are likely to have an                 impact on neuroscience in general.",
