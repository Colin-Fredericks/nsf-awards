 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311319  FERNANDEZ       Two of the most prominent explanations given for relatively  low rates of achievement by members of minority groups in U.S.  labor markets have been called the \"spatial mismatch\" and the  \"skills mismatch\" hypotheses.  Proponents of the spatial mismatch  hypothesis argue that many minority workers experience  difficulties in finding and holding jobs because many employers  have relocated from central-city locales near the homes of most  minority workers to more remote suburban locations.  Advocates of  the skills mismatch hypothesis maintain that technological  changes in the economy as a whole have changed the character of  employment, leaving many workers, especially members of more  poorly educated minority groups, without requisite skills to  assume new jobs.  This project examines both of these hypotheses  through continuation of a case study of a plant that retooled  (creating new forms of jobs) when it relocated from central  Milwaukee to a suburban site in 1992.  Lengthy interviews will be  conducted with many employees who were surveyed in 1991, creating  a longitudinal database that will help determine the degree to  which locational and employment-skill changes impeded the  adjustment of minority workers to the new plant.  Special  attention will focus on analyses of decisions by workers to  relocate their homes closer to the new plant (as opposed to  commuting over longer distances) as a response to geographical  changes and to examination of the processes by which workers were  assigned to jobs in the new plant.       This research will provide valuable new insights into two  important dimensions of change in modern metropolitan economies.  In addition to generating a detailed longitudinal database about  this specific case, the research will provide simultaneous tests  of two controversial hypotheses using methods that can be  replicated in other contexts.  ***",
