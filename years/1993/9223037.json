 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several areas of research in organosilicon, organoaluminum, and                 organoboron chemistry will be pursued, which include: (1) Gas-phase             ion-molecule chemistry to prepare and study the reactivity and                  thermochemistry of a number of low-, normal-, and high-valent                   silicon, aluminum, and boron containing anions. Triple quadrupole               collisionally-induced dissociation (CID) will be used to study                  thermochemical parameters. (2) Periodic Table relationships and                 substituent effects of these anions will be investigated. (3)                   Relationships between the anions and their corresponding neutrals,              which are in general species of enhanced reactivity and of                      theoretical interest, will be pursued. (4) Condensed-phase studies              will be continued to prepare silicon-containing cages in order to               probe inside-outside substituent effects and to generate silicon-               carbon bonds from organoboranes.                                                %%%                                                                             This grant from the Organic Dynamics Program supports the                       continuing work of Professor Robert Damrauer at the University of               Colorado at Denver. The major thrust of the research will be a                  study of molecules containing silicon, aluminum, and boron in the               gas-phase. The chemistry, thermochemistry, and acidity of these                 highly reactive species will be determined. Comparisons of these                properties will be made between the silicon, aluminum, and boron                molecules, based on the Periodic Table of elemental properties.                 These studies will shed light on technical aspects of the                       manufacture of electronic components. Another aspect of the                     research will be directed to the study of silicon-containing cage               molecules and the generation of silicon-carbon bonds in the                     condensed-phase.",
