Many classical                                               linear quadratic control problems                                               can be converted to an L2                                                       optimization problem.  It is well                                               known that these L2 or linear                                                   quadratic controllers may not be                                                robust.  To get around this problem                                             many researchers turned to Hoo                                                  optimization.  Although, the Hoo                                                controllers are robust, they                                                    produce systems with a large                                                    bandwidth.  This research will use                                              the commutant lifting theorem to                                                find controllers  which exhibit the                                             appropriate trade off between the                                               standard L2 and Hoo controllers.  By                                            solving certain mixed L2 - Hoo (four                                            block) problems this work will                                                  obtain robust controllers with                                                  strong linear quadratic                                                         performance.  The proofs are based                                              on the central solution for the                                                 commutant lifting theorem.  In the                                              rational case the L2 - Hoo                                                      controllers will be computed by                                                 using standard state space                                                      techniques.  In the nonrational                                                 case these controllers will be                                                  computed by using the commutant                                                 lifting theorem, along with some                                                skew-Toeplitz techniques.  This                                                 work will also be extended to                                                   certain nonlinear systems involving                                             Volterra series.",
