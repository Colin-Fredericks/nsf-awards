 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implicit surfaces are shapes described by the points where a  function is zero.  Sphere tracing is a recently developed method  for rendering  implicit surfaces that operates on implicit  functions that indicate the  distance to the implicit surface.  Such implicit functions are developed  for common modeling  primitives, CSG operations, some blends, and some domain  transformations which deform objects, but many other surfaces,  such as offset  surfaces, and other operations, blends and  deformation remain.    Sphere  tracing is a robust efficient implicit surface rendering  algorithm.  It ray  traces implicit surfaces by tracking along  each ray by the distance to the  implicit surface, as reported by  the implicit function.  This iteration  converges on the first ray-surface intersection.  Sphere tracing also provides  an area  sampling method for antialiasing.  Enhancements to  sphere  tracing include the sphere buffer which allows sphere  tracing to capitalize on  spatial coherence, spatial partition,  and a method for eliminating all  iteration from implicit  surface rendering.    Also addressed are the problems of  animating implicit surfaces,  particularly the consistent texturing of an  implicit surface as  it deforms, possibly changing genus.",
