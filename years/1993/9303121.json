 "awd_abstract_narration": "9303121  Lai       The investigator studies bivariate splines of smoothness  rand degree d with a small d vs. r to enhance the efficiency of  using bivariate splines to solve application problems, and uses  new or recent results on multivariate splines to solve some  application problems in computer aided geometric design,  numerical image processing, and numerical solution of partial  differential equations.       Multivariate splines are piecewise polynomial functions with  certain smoothness.  The pieces need not fit together as  smoothly as if they all were part of the same polynomial.   Roughly speaking, the higher the degree of the piecewise  polynomial relative to its smoothness, the more roughly the  pieces can fit together.  Because polynomial functions are the  easiest functions to manipulate and because almost all problems  in the real world are multivariable or multiparametric in nature,  multivariate splines are a good tool to model the target  functions.  Although the theory of bivariate splines with large  degree versus smoothness is available, bivariate splines have too  large a degree to be used in practice efficiently.  That is, only  bivariate splines with small degree versus smoothness can achieve  the efficiency and the accuracy required by computer aided  geometric design, numerical image processing, and numerical  solution of partial differential equations.  At present, those  bivariate splines can be constructed for a few cases.  The  project undertakes aspects of a general theory of such splines,  with an eye to the applications.  ***",
