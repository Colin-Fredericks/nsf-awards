The                          determination of the structure of the tubulin dimer, the major                  component of microtubules, would be of great value in understanding             how microtubules assemble, disassemble and function in cells.  In               addition, it should greatly improve our knowledge of how several                medically and agriculturally important compounds bind to and act                upon microtubules.  Previous efforts to crystallize tubulin have                failed because of problems with tubulin heterogeneity and stability             and because of the tendency of tubulin to assemble into                         microtubules rather than crystallize.  To circumvent these                      problems, Dr. Oakley proposes to purify beta-tubulin, one of two                molecules that form the tubulin dimer, and to purify a polypeptide              containing an important structural domain of beta-tubulin.  The                 genes encoding the molecules will be placed under the control of a              powerful inducible promoter and inserted by transformation in the               filamentous fungus, Aspergillus nidulans.  The molecules will be                produced at high levels and will be purified by affinity                        chromatography using six histidine residues inserted at the                     carboxyl termini of the molecules.  GTP and drug binding studies                will be performed to determine if the molecules have their native               structure and if the structure is stable over time.  If these                   experiments are successful, the purified molecules will                         subsequently be used for structural studies.                                    %%%                                                                             Tubulin, the monomeric component of microtubules, is a structural               protein ubiquitous in the eukaryotic world and fundamental to life              as we know it.  Understanding its molecular structure would be                  important for understanding its functions in nature, and would                  allow genetic engineering approaches to be used to adapt it for new             functions of possible commercial interest (such as molecular                    switches).  Tubulin is a scaffolding for shape, a road map for                  intracellular motility, a determinant of post-cleavage cell fate;               it is the stuff of the mitotic spindle, responsible for chromosome              segregation to daughter cells, and the stuff of cilia and flagella,             responsible for cellular locomotion.  Tubulin is actually a family              of genetically distinct proteins, which are further diversified by              post-translational modifications.  It has proven very difficult to              get structural information on tubulin, because of the difficulties              inherent in purifying a homogeneous protein from natural sources.               This project represents a plausible yet very high-risk approach to              obtaining sufficient quantities of homogeneous, pure, native,                   monomeric tubulin for structural studies.",
