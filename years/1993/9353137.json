These universities have agreed to utilize their resources and  expertise to provide quality academic experiences for  undergraduates and increase the enrollment, retention, and  matriculation of African American, Hispanic American, Native  American, and other minority students who are underrepresented in  science, engineering, and mathematics (SEM) fields.  The Alliance  will encompass outreach components through partnerships and formal  articulation agreements with Community Colleges in Maryland and  Virginia, and will forge a coalition with other mid-Atlantic HBCUs,  including Bowie State, Coppin State, University of Maryland at  Eastern Shore, Norfolk State, Virginia State/Petersburgh, St.  Paul's College, and Virginia Union College.  These latter colleges  and universities will be invited to network to afford their  students the opportunity to participate in the Summer Math Bridge  and Summer Institutes and other undergraduate enrichment activities  at Core Alliance Institutions.  The Alliance will be enhanced by  existing consortia, linkages, and partnerships with industry,  governmental agencies, and mainstream research universities.  The  number of trainees directly involved in this program over the five-  year period will be more that 5,000 students.",
