 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most zooplankton undergo diel vertical migration (DVM) at some                  stage of development. The common pattern involves an ascent near                sunset and descent near sunrise.  The most pervasive functional                 explanations are that animals rise to feed at night and descend to              avoid visually-oriented predators during the day.  Recent studies               indicate the presence and absence of planktivores can alter DVM                 through rapid behavioral changes. Since light is the most important             cue for DVM, alterations in migration by cues from predators should             involve changes in photoresponses.  Thus, photoresponses can be                 used as a behavioral assay to direct characterization, purification             and identification of the chemical cue(s) from predators.  The                  objectives of this project are: (1) to determine whether                        photoresponses involved in DVM are altered by the presence or                   absence of planktivores that do (fish) and do not (ctenophore and               chaetognath) visually sight their prey, (2) to determine whether                chemical cues form predators induce alterations in zooplankton                  photoresponses that are involved in DVM,  and (3) to characterize               the chemical cues form the predators.                                                                                                                           Larvae of the crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii and of brine shrimp                 (Artemia sp.) will be studied because both undergo DVM and                      preliminary studies suggest their photoresponses are altered by                 chemical cues from planktivores.  Photoresponses will be monitored              with a video system and tested in an apparatus that mimics the                  natural underwater angular light distribution.  Preliminary studies             indicate the active chemicals from fish are less than 500 Daltons               in molecular size and the investigators predict that the                        biologically active molecules are odors generated by hydrolysis of              molecules found commonly on fish surfaces.  Disaccharides                       originating form fish mucus, and small peptides originating from                epithelial proteins are likely candidates.",
