This approach to communications beyond line-of-                   sight distances will compete with two-way cable systems and high-               speed telephone in the coming years, and the proposed research                  will assess its value relative to solutions being explored by                   larger industries.  The proposal addresses an important problem                 of US education:  The future quality of rural education depends                 on high quality, low cost communications.  Moreover, it                         represents a peacetime application for education of a derivative                of advanced technology developed for the military.",
