The 6th US-Japan Workshop will be held in Houston,  Texas, hosted by the Texas Center on Superconductivity at the  University of Houston on December 7-8, 1993.  The Workshop is  organized to address research problems in four technical areas,  they are:  wire and coil development; phase equilibrium and  processing issues for bulk materials; thin films and new materials;  and vortex dynamics and pinning.  Participants are invited to the  Workshop, and they are selected from university, industry, and  national laboratories.  %%%  This project is for the 6th US-Japan Workshop to be held in  Houston, Texas, and hosted by the Texas Center on Superconductivity  at the University of Houston on December 7-8, 1993.
