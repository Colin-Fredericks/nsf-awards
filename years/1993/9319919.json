 "awd_abstract_narration": "9319919  Kelley  The purpose of this Small Grant for Exploratory research (SGER) is  to plan and carry out a key component to the first incoherent  scatter observations in the frequency range 20-25 MHz by using a  huge Radio Telescope located near Kharkov, Ukraine.  The work is  closely coupled to the joint proposal from Tulsa University and te  Radiophysical Research institute (NIRFI) in Nizhny Novgorod.  Under  the latter proposal an antenna field will be constructed at  Vasil\"sursk in Russia.  Upon completion of one-third of the  projected antenna field, a joint experiment will be carried outto  test the notion that incoherent scatter can be carried out in the  bi-static mode described here.  The results of the project will be  crucial in assessing the performance of the full system which will  have three times the power and three times the antenna size.  In  turn these data will allow the NSF to gauge the importance of  taking the next steps in a possible International facility for  probing the inner magnetosphere with incoherent scatter and the  source of the aurora with coherent scatter.  The proposal is appropriate for a SGER grant since it is clearly  exploratory and high risk.  There has never been an incoherent  scatter radar measurement at this frequency nor has there been a  way to determine the location of the outer boundary of the  plasmasphere by radar methods.  This experiment will allow a clear  assessment of the ability of a ground based system to track this  important boundary.  In addition the very difficult present  situation for scientists  in the Ukraine makes such a cooperative  effort very important in the nearest future.  Among other things,  immediate support is needed for the large UTR-2 antenna array  (radio telescope) whose value for the world radio-scientific  community is unique and which is critically important for the  project described here.  ***",
