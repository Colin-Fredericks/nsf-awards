Kennedy of the University of Akron and Dr. Tibor Kelen  of the Institute of Applied Chemistry, Kossuth University, Budapest.  The researchers intend  to synthesize, by living carbocationic copolymerization, three series of novel random  copolymers: isobutylene/styrene (IBu/St), isobutylene/indene (IBu/Ind), and styrene/indene  (St/Ind).  In the process, they will develop conditions to demonstrate living random  copolymerizations by kinetic experiments and then, describe the composition, molecular  weight and molecular weight distribution of their products.  Building upon their findings, Dr.  Kennedy and Dr. Kelen also will investigate compositional heterogeneity as a function of  molecular weight.  Once they feel they have optimized the syntheses of random living  IBu/ST, IBu/Ind copolymers, they will prepare sufficient quantities of promising copolymer  products for study of structure/property correlations.  Results should yield new insights of  importance in future engineering applications such as coatings and adhesives.    This project in materials research fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by  enabling leading experts in the U. S. and Hungary to combine complementary talents and  pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
