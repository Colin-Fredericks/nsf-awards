 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key to understanding the molecular basis for bacterial                        pathogenicity in plants is the production and deployment of plant               defense elicitors and host range determinants.  We have previously              shown that the hrp/hrm gene cluster isolated from Pseudomonas                   syringae pv. syringae 61 enables nonpathogenic bacteria to elicit               plant defenses.  The hrp/hrm gene cluster, therefore, appears to                constitute a minimum genetic unit sufficient to produce plant                   defense elicitors.  Fourteen apparent transnational units have been             identified within the cluster that are organized as nine apparent               transcriptional units.  Several hrp genes act as positive                       regulatory elements.  The overall goal of this project is to                    elucidate the role of specific hrp/hrm genes in determining the                 pathogenicity and host range of P. syringae strains.  Our approach              will be to:  1)  obtain the nucleotide sequence for remaining                   portions of the cluster to facilitate later manipulation,                       comparative analyses with other bacteria and deduction of gene                  function; 2) characterize the regulatory cascade controlling                    expression of hrp genes so that the genes directly contributing to              the production of plant defense elicitors can be identified and                 manipulated; and 3) perform gene replacement experiments to test                the role of specific hrp genes in determining pathogenicity and                 host range.                                                                     %%%                                                                             The study of these genes should lead to techniques useful in                    stopping the damage to plants susceptible to bacterial infection.",
