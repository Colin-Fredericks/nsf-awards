 "awd_abstract_narration": "The role of myosin heads in the process of myosin and sarcomere              assembly will be investigated.  Work in progress indicates that                 expression of myosin heads lacking rod sequence disrupts sarcomere              organization in the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans.  Experiments              are proposed to define regions of the myosin head responsible for               the muscle-disruptive effect and to determine the gate of truncated             myosin molecules.  Transgenic nematodes expressing full-length                  myosin or myosin head fragments will be produced.  The motility and             muscle ultrastructural defects of control and experimental                      transgenic worms will be compared.  The smallest myosin fragment                which disrupts muscle organization will be characterized.                       %%%                                                                             The contractile mechanism of muscle tissue consists of two major                proteins, myosin and actin, which are arranged (along with other                auxiliary proteins) in densely packed, highly ordered arrays termed             sarcomeres, such that linear arrays of myosin molecules (the                    \"motor\" for contractile movement, which transduces chemical energy              into mechanical energy) move along actin filaments (which serve as              the \"track\"), resulting in shortening of the sarcomere (and hence               of the muscle itself).  This project is concerned with the role of              the myosin molecules in the assembly of the contractile apparatus.              The power of genetic manipulations will be employed to engineer                 nematodes with myosin molecules bearing mutations at specific                   sites, to determine the functional consequence of these specific                mutations.  An understanding of the structural requirements for                 contractile machinery assembly is a necessary prerequisite to                   biotechnological applications of biomolecular motors.  Given the                high degree of conservation among myosins throughout the animal                 kingdom, it is expected that the results obtained with the nematode             model system will be generally applicable to other animals.",
