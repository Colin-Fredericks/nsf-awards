 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal control of solutions of dynamical systems which may                not exist globally in time will be the focus of this project. The               maximum time for which the solution exists is called the blowup                 time. When the dynamics contain a control the blowup time depends               on the control. It is natural to pose the problem of optimally                  controlling the blowup time. The main direction of this research                will be to characterize the blowup time and associated blowup                   set, that is, the set on which the blowup time is finite, as a                  function of the initial conditions of the problem. Additional                   problems of interest include optimal control of extinction time,                that is, the first time the system reaches the zero state, which                is related to classical questions of controllability, and optimal               control of the quenching time, that is, the first time the                      derivative blows up but the function remains bounded.                                This project is concerned with controlling the onset of                    unbounded behavior in singular systems.  Mathematical models of                 phenomena such as thermal combustion exhibit this behavior, which               is known as blowup. In such problems the solution of the model                  problem becomes unbounded in finite time. As a practical matter,                it may be desired to delay the onset of blowup for as long as                   possible in order to allow, for example, the temperature to                     increase as much as possible prior to combustion. Similarly,                    certain biological and economic problems can be described by                    equations which exhibit blowup in finite time. Maximizing the                   blowup time in a system governing the growth of tumors, for                     example, would be effected through the use of chemotherapeutic or               radiation therapy as the control. Controlling the extinction time               of such a system would amount to minimizing the time at which the               tumor size decreases to zero.",
