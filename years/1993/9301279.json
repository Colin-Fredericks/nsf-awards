The funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF)                          will support primarily individual American scientists to                        either travel to or host colleagues from the former                             Soviet Union and Eastern Europe for one to six months.                          Up to 40 percent of the fellowships will be provided for                        two-week project development visits which allow                                 participants to develop plans for long-term cooperative                         research projects, with special emphasis on developing                          concrete proposals for submission to NSF's FSU/EE                               cooperative science programs.  The project development                          visits are also intended to provide support for                                 scientists to respond, with relatively short lead time,                         to unusual scientific opportunities of exceptional merit                        and potential benefit to U.S. science.                                                                                                                          Young investigators will be given special consideration                         in the selection.  At least 25 percent of the                                   fellowships, both in long-term research and project                             development visits, will be awarded to young                                    investigators as an encouragement to and investment in                          long-term collaboration.  In the absence of a U.S.                              government science and technology agreement with Romania,                       the Romania twinning program will continue to foster                            interaction between American scientists and their                               Romanian colleagues, who remain largely isolated from the                       international scientific community.                                                                                                                             A small portion of the requested funds will support                             compilations of information about science and technology                        development in the region obtained through these                                individual visits and other OCEE activities.                                                                                                                    This project fulfills the program objective of advancing                        scientific knowledge by enabling leading researchers in                         the United States and Eastern Europe, including the                             former Soviet Union, to combine complementary efforts and                       capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and                             competence in the field of basic scientific research on                         the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of                            benefit.",
