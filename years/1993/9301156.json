 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coastal Research Laboratory at the Woods Hole Oceanographic                 Institution will upgrade an aging two-axis, forward-scatter laser               Doppler volicimeter (LDV).  The LDV is mounted on a large 17-meter              recirculating seawater flume that is used by a large number of                  investigators for a variety of projects.  Several electronic and                electro-optical components of the system have deteriorated over                 time due to the continual presence of salt aerosols and others have             become obsolete.  The flume provides a steady flow of recirculating             seawater and experiments are set up in the flume to measure the                 fine-scale flow characteristics and turbulence fluctuations assoc-              iated with the experiment. The LDV measures the Doppler frequency               shift from two laser beams that are aimed into the flow.  Advanced              signal processing is used to derive detailed patterns of the                    flowing seawater.  The use of flumes and LDVs for better under-                 standing flow characteristics is becoming increasingly important                for studying oceanographic processes, especially within the bottom              boundary layer.  This upgrade will cost-effectively provide a                   state-of-the-art system that will be available for shared use.",
