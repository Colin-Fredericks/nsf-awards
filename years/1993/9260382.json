 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the general area of analytical and surface chemistry and in the              subfield of magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  The objective of                  this research is to determine the feasibility of constructing a                 novel, high speed magic angle spinning system for use in nuclear                magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.  The approach chosen will                use both technology which is based upon gas bearing systems and                 technologies previously developed by Creare personnel for                       incorporation into a variety of devices, some of which have been                commercialized.  Current sample spinners for NMR spectroscopy are               generally limited in rotation speed to approximately 10 kHz.  A                 unique gas bearing system based on principles successfully                      employed in high speed, miniature cryogenic turbomachines will be               used to achieve a 40 kHz rotation speed.  The bearing will                      incorporate damping cavities and feed orifices to provide capacity              and stability.  The bearing will also be configured to accommodate              unbalance from nonuniform packing of sample material.  In Phase                 I, a shaft will be spun to 40 kHz to demonstrate the feasibility                of the approach.  If successful, a complete ultra high speed                    sample spinner assembly could then be demonstrated in Phase II.                 %%%                                                                             This research will test the feasibility of an NMR sample spinner                that is capable of stable operation at rotation speeds of up to 40              kHz.  This device would significantly improve the resolution                    capability of solid state NMR by reducing spectrum broadening                   effects caused by proton-proton dipolar couplings.",
