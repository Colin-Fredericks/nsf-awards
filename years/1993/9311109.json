 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311109  Moore    Unambiguous communication is a feature of populations that have structured social systems.   Nonetheless, variation among individuals in their communication signals may be important in  the establishment and maintenance of stable social organizations.  However, the genetic basis  and consequences of variation in acoustic communication are poorly understood.   Ms.  Deborah C. Clark's doctoral-dissertation research will attempt to clarify the role of acoustic  communication in competition between males of a subsocial invertebrate, Gromphadorhina  portentosa.  This cockroach species is notable for its agonistic interactions among males,  involving diverse and complex behavior including the use of agonistic hisses.  Using  behavioral, acoustic, and genetic techniques, Ms. Clark will quantify the variation among  individuals in frequency, amplitude, duration, and temporal pattern of hisses occurring  during interactions between males.  Ms. Clark will estimate genetic variances and  covariances for characteristics of agonistic hisses, and will conduct experiments to investigate  the function of variation in hisses.    This research is unique in investigating social competition and acoustic communication in a  subsocial invertebrate.  These studies will address important issues relevant to the evolution  and use of acoustic signals in communication.",
