This program takes Native American youngsters, a group  that is under-represented in science, and exposes them to hands-on  activities to give them a more realistic understanding of science  careers.  To carry out this project, partnerships have been formed  between the Museum and governmental agencies and educational  institutions.  These partnerships have been designed to provide  middle school students with a broad exposure to science-based  careers in New Mexico.  Using water quality monitoring as a theme  unifies all of the student activities associated with this project.   Water quality, water conservation, and the ecology of riparian  areas are of great concern to the arid southwestern US.  This theme  has been chosen to facilitate the involvement of whole families and  rural communities in the program.  The community-and family-support  produced through the choice of this theme is intended to reinforce  the shifts in student attitudes toward science.  Thus, this project  is wellsuited for Native American students whose sense of self if  often strongly influenced by family.",
