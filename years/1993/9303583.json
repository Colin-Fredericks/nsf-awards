Large arrays of small disks provide an attractive approach for high  performance systems since they allow for low-cost, reliable storage  and can achieve higher throughput compared to large disks.  This  project proposes to develop an integrated set of algorithms and an  intelligent file manager which is applicable to any multi-disk  architecture in which the operating system can access the disks  independently.  The emphasis of the approach is on the use of  modular building blocks for file partitioning, allocation, load  balancing, and reorganization that can be invoked independently of  each other.  Thus, the procedure for load balancing can be called  regardless of whether striping or declustering is employed and does  not depend upon the unit of declustering.  The development of a  generalized method for load balancing is considered which can be  applied to an environment where some files exhibit periodical  access patterns and which considers explicitly the cost of  performing the cooling actions.  The investigation also focuses on  reorganization procedures that perform restriping when higher  performance standards need to be enforced.  The anticipated results  of this project are of importance to massively parallel computers  to support scalability and to ensure that the I/O is not the  limiting factor in achieving high speedup.   ***",
