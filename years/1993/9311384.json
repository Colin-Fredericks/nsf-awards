Workshop on                                 Biogeochemical Processes in the Arabian Sea, will                               be held during mid-September, 1993, in the                                      Crimea, Ukraine.  Dr. Joel C. Goldman and Dr.                                   Hugh D. Livingston, Woods Hole Oceanographic                                    Institution, will cooperate with the Marine                                     Hydrophysical Institute (MHI) and the Institute                                 of Biology of the Southern Seas (IBSS), both                                    located in Sevastopol.  It has been designed to:                                (a) disseminate data and literature from previous                               research activities of Former Soviet Union (FSU)                                oceanographers in the Arabian Sea, (b) describe                                 to FSU colleagues the current US and                                            International interests in the forthcoming                                      Arabian Sea initiatives by JGOFS, NOAA and other                                US agencies, (c) provide opportunities for FSU                                  scientists to establish scientific contacts with                                their US counterparts, and (d) form connections                                 which might lead to scientific cooperation                                      between each other in both the Arabian Sea and                                  other ocean areas of mutual interest.  The                                      proposed work would be jointly funded by the US                                 and the two laboratories in Sevastopol.  It would                               last five days and involve 17 US and 20-25 FSU                                  participants, many of whom have previous research                               experience in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean.                                                                                                                 This project in oceanography fulfills the program                               objectives of advancing science by enabling                                     leading experts in the U.S. and the FSU to                                      combine complementary talents and pool research                                 resources in areas of strong mutual interest and                                competence.",
