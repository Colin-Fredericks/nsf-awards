By the mid-20th century, however, a radical  shift had occurred in the object of study for a significant  component within biology:  the object of study became  microorganisms, particularly viruses and bacteria rather than the  more complex organisms.  This transformation resulting in the  creation of molecular biology revolutionized the whole discipline  of biology.  Ms. Susan B. Spath, working under the direction of Dr.  John Lesch, is studying one of the sources of this transformation  in the so-called \"Delft School\" of microbiology.  She is focussing  her dissertation research on C. B. van Niel (1897-1985), who  brought the \"Delft School\" ideals to the United States when he  became professor at Stanford University's marine biological station  in 1929.  Van Niel taught for over thirty years a celebrated course  in which participated a remarkable number of the major players in  the development of molecular biology.  Ms. Spath is assessing the  impact of this course on the way biology developed in the critical  period when molecular biology was first forming as a distinct  research program.  She is also examining the definitions of the  fundamental categories of cellular life as formulated by van Niel  and his student and colleague Roger Stanier in 1962.  ***",
