 "awd_abstract_narration": "The needs for expanded research on global environmental                    change has highlighted the need for greater cooperation and                     collaboration among scientists in different nations to address                  problems that affect the world as a whole.  Under the auspices of               the U.S.-Japan Science and Technology Agreement, the Committee on               Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) of the Federal                          Coordinating Commission on Science, Engineering, and Technology                 (FCCSET) is sponsoring a series of bilateral workshops to examine               ways that scientists and engineers from both nations can address                significant research problems.  The second is this series of                    workshops is being held in Honolulu, Hawaii, in early February                  1993.  The objectives of this three-day workshop are (1) to                     permit participants from the U.S. and Japan to provide overviews                of research and development activities within their nations                     mitigating increases in energy-related greenhouse gases in the                  atmosphere and adapting to greenhouse gas-induced climatic                      changes; (2) to identify topics for future global change                        mitigation and adaptation research; and (3) to identify potential               forms of collaborative research and development between the U.S.                and Japan on mitigation and adaptation technologies and practices               related to greenhouse gas-induced climatic changes.  This award                 provides reimbursement to the East-West Center (Center for                      Cultural and Technology Interchange Between East and West, Inc.)                for costs it will incur as it assists CEES in hosting this                      meeting.  Funds to provide this reimbursement are being                         transferred to NSF from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and                  the U.S. Department of Energy.                                                       This workshop will provide a valuable opportunity for                      scientists and engineers from the U.S. and Japan to address                     collectively important problems related to the human dimensions                 of global change, and it will encourage the development of                      research and development collaborations among individuals from                  the two nations.",
