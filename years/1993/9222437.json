 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a long-term visit to Japan for                  Professor Robert Latorre, Professor and Chairman, Department of                 Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, University of New                    Orleans, who will work with Professor Hideaki Miyata, Department                of Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering, University of Tokyo,               from January to June 1993.  The project involves computer                       modeling of the free surface flow around a flat or blunt bow                    typical of barges, towboats, and workboats used in the Gulf of                  Mexico.  The numerical calculations will be made by using the                   Tokyo University Modified Marker and Cell program, TUMMAC.  This                program has been used to study a number of free surface flows                   caused by slender and moderately full hull forms, as well as                    breaking waves.                                                                                                                                                 The research project will contribute to the advancement of                      technology in the area of ship design and ocean engineering.  The               unique problem is the inclusion of the free-surface in the fluid                dynamics equations.  Although it may be awhile before                           shipbuilding is restored to its previous level of activity, it                  may not be so long before ship design using computer aided                      virtual simulations is internationally centered in the United                   States.  The integration of codes such as TUMMAC into the design                procedure is important in this development.  The project will                   also result in enhanced engineering education through computer                  and video instructional materials.",
