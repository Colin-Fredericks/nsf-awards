 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project launches the creation of a new class of                            playground apparatus based on an emerging understanding of how                  students learn mathematics and science concepts.  The                           equipment will be highly interactive and instrumented,                          providing opportunities for thoughtful, planned actions that                    children can evaluate with the aid of instrumentation.  The                     design principles used are applicable to many mathematics and                   science topics, but this initial demonstration is restricted                    to creating units which embody some important concepts from                     classical mechanics.  We will create, test, evaluate, and                       begin the dissemination of units incorporating timing, motion,                  and force sensor electronics designed to give children real-                    time, symbolic feedback to reflect their experiences.                                                                                                           The first nine months will be devoted to the apparatus design,                  building, testing, safety evaluation, and formative research.                   We will install apparatus in three highly varied sites to                       evaluate the design.  In a second phase, improved units will                    be built for one site and detailed research on student                          learning undertaken.  If we observe the hypothesized learning,                  the approach we use in mechanics will have broad                                generalizability.  This work could lead to interesting and                      highly educational apparatus addressing other science fields                    and useful in a broad range of informal learning environments.",
