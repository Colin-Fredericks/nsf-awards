The main objectives are to provide eight                   (8) undergraduate students with an opportunity to work during                   the summer in an intense, interdisciplinary, collaborative                      research environment and to involve them in a program of                        discussions and interactions with faculty and graduate                          students that will show them both the relationships among                       atomic, molecular, optical, and surface sciences and the                        technological ramifications of fundamental research in this                     area.  Further objectives are to give these undergraduates an                   understanding of how atomic, molecular, optical, and surface                    science relates to many important technologies and to convey                    to them a sense of the real intellectual excitement of this                     research and the future for its technological applications.                     Each undergraduate will join a research group, undertake a                      project that can be completed within the summer, attend                         special seminars and group discussions for REU participants,                    make a formal report of the project, and participate in the                     RQI Research Colloquium at summer's end.  The 32 faculty                        fellows of RQI and their groups have considerable                               undergraduate involvement in research now; however, this                        program will provide additional research opportunities, will                    create a coherent educational structure for these students                      during the summer, and will allow for tracking the educational                  progress and careers of all undergraduates who work with RQI                    groups.",
