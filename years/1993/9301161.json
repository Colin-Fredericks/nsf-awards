 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Cox to work in               algebraic geometry.  One of the problems that Professor Cox will                address will be the issue of assigning a coordinate ring to a                   toric variety in a natural way.  This ring should be a polynomial               ring and should depend only on the toric variety and not on a                   particular projective embedding.  Professor Cox has a suggested                 construction which seems to have many of the needed properties.                      This research uses the techniques of algebraic geometry, one               of the oldest parts of modern mathematics, but one which has had                a revolutionary flowering in the past quarter-century. In its                   origin, it treated figures that could be defined in the plane by                the simplest equations, namely polynomials. Nowadays the field                  makes use of methods not only from algebra, but from analysis and               topology, and conversely is finding application in those fields                 as well as in physics, theoretical computer science, and                        robotics.",
