 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal ions figure significantly in the activity of many enzymes                 biological systems also make very subtle distinctions among                     metallic elements to control fundamental information transduction               processes.  Moreover, proteins with active-site sulfhydryl groups               (potential metal binding targets) play key roles in DNA replication             and repair.  Presently, our understanding of what determines                    specific protein-metal interactions and of how alternative metals               can modulate protein behavior is incomplete.  Summers studies the               bacterial mercury (Hg) resistance (mer) locus, an operon controlled             by a small, Hg-responsive, DNA binding, transcriptional                         activator/repressor, MerR.  Her work has focussed on MerR                       interactions with its cognate DNA site, merOP, and with RNA                     polymerase.  She will use molecular genetics and biochemistry to                discern the MerR domains which enable it to sequester RNA                       polymerase at merOP prior to induction and those responsible for                the DNA distortion which takes place during activation.  She will               dissect the relationship between the mer operon and the                         chromosomally encoded oxidative shock regulon.  Finally, she will               employ random and site specific mutagenesis to obtain MerR mutants              responsive to transition metals other than Hg(II).  These variant               MerR proteins will be examined in vitro for their metal and DNA                 binding properties.                                                             %%%                                                                             Certain micro-organisms have the ability to grow in the presence of             chemicals which are toxic to most other organisms.  One way this is             accomplished is through conversion of the toxic form of the                     chemical to a non or less toxic form.  This proposal investigates               the genetic mechanisms which regulate and control the expression of             a set of genes in bacteria which function in the detoxification of              mercury.                                                                        $$$//",
