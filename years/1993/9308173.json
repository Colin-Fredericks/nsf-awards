(Jointly funded with Cross                           Disciplinary Activities - Total Award                            $240,752)    Intonational Correlates of Discourse Structures    This is the second part funding of a standard award initiated in  FY93 and processed as a swing grant to conduct research on the  empirical verification of the Grosz-Sidner theory of structural  discourse analysis, and on the correlation of intonational  indicators with both global and local structures of discourse.  The  subject of study is a multiple speaker corpus (to assure generality  of results and experiments that can be replicated) of discourse  from instructional and narrative genres; the corpus is annotated  subjectively for structural characteristics and, independently and  objectively, for intonational features using signal analysis  methods, with the purpose of establishing the correlation between  the two taggings.  A positive, well-established, correlation would  allow the use of those discourse features indicating intonational  variations in algorithms that produce corresponding intonational  variations in synthesized speech of quality higher ordinary.  The  results of this project should establish the relationship between  discourse structures and the phonetically determined signal  features of discourse.",
