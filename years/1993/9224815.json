The                   research addresses the next generation of model-based vision                    systems, which should demonstrate the recognition in monocular                  image data of complex curved objects selected from a large database             of models.  This will require major progress in the areas of shape              representation, modeling, and matching. This research focuses on a              novel shape representation and its application to automatic model               construction from sets of range and video images and to object                  recognition, including aspect graph construction, pose computation,             and indexing into a database of models.  In this research,                      arbitrary smooth 3D shapes are represented by a  set of                         characteristic surface curves having the properties that they                   determine the structure of the image contours and its catastrophic              changes, and there is a natural correspondence between some of                  these curves and monocular contour features such as inflections and             bitangents.",
