 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coastal Laboratory Consortium, comprised                               of four North Carolina Universities, operates                                   degree granting programs in marine science research                             and research training.  This award will provide                                 funding for the modernization of the University of                              North Carolina, Chapel Hill's Institute of Marine                               Science.  Interdisciplinary research activities                                 currently performed at the institute are in five                                general areas:  experimental analyses of ecological                             processes of sea floor communities, biogeochemical                              cycling and productivity in coastal waters, geology                             of sedimentary coastlines, ecology of coastal                                   organisms and air and sea interactions in near                                  shore waters.  The Institute of Marine Science                                  attracts visiting scientists from many institutions                             in the US and abroad, fostering strong research                                 collaborations.  Both graduate and undergraduate                                students participate in research training                                       activities at the facility, including a large                                   percentage of minority studnets from historically                               minority colleges and universities.                                                  Present conditions, at the 25 year old                                     facility, are unsafe and laboratories are                                       inadequate for conducting research.  The lack of                                climate control, proper electrical and air supply,                              incubation facilities, clean rooms, and modernized                              laboratory space adds to the problems researchers                               encounter daily.  Funds are requested to upgrade                                laboratory space that is designed to accommodate                                sophisticated chemical, biotechnological,                                       analytical research activities and equipment.                                   Modern research facilities at the Institute of                                  Marine Science will contribute to the productive                                research and research training within the marine                                science programs of the consortium institutions and                             strengthen the nation's scientific infrastructure.",
