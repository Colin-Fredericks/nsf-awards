 "awd_abstract_narration": "In developing countries, the provision of disaster relief is                    among the most visible and costly functions performed by                        governments to promote social welfare.  In China, for example,                  disaster relief accounted for 70 to 80% of social welfare                       expenditures between 1983 and 1987.  Disaster relief is also a                  large budget item in industrialized countries like the United                   States.  The U.S. government regularly pays substantial sums for                relief and a large share of humanitarian aid to other countries                 is given in the wake of disasters.  The United Nations noted the                importance of relief and the debates about how to provide it when               it designated the 1990's as the International Decade of Disaster                Relief.                                                                                                                                                         The study has three objectives.  The first is to set out the                    basic economic principles of disaster relief programs.  A                       theoretical analysis will clarify tradeoffs between welfare and                 efficiency in the provision of aid.  A central argument is that                 the economic effects of disaster relief differ substantially in                 economies with well-developed insurance markets like the U.S. and               these without, like China or India.  The second aim is to apply                 the theoretical insights and analyze the disaster relief system                 in China.  It is estimated that the cumulative loss from                        disasters amount to 3-4% of GNP each year, and disaster relief                  has become an especially important part of the social safety net                since de-collectivization.  The effect of environmental changes                 on the frequency and scale of disasters is also investigated in                 terms of increased costs, the ability to target the most needy                  recipients, and institutional weaknesses in China.  The third aim               of the study builds on the first two and involves extending the                 collection of a household level data set initiated in the                       Shandong Province of China.  The data set will allow the                        application of new econometric techniques to test hypotheses                    about the extent of consumption smoothing and risk taking in face               of possible disasters.",
