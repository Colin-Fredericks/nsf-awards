 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Southern California's (USC) Allan Hancock                     Foundation (AHF) polychaete collection was donated to the Los                   Angeles County Museum of Natural History (LACM) in 1988.  The                   collection is the largest of its kind in the western United                     States and second largest in the country, maintaining the most                  extensive holdings in eastern Pacific polychaetes in the world,                 yet is cosmopolitan in its total coverage.  Following this                      acquisition, the LACM hired a polychaete collection manager in                  1988 and a curator in 1990.  Along with a small wet collection of               sponges, platyhelminths, nemerteans, and tunicates donated to                   LACM in 1992 by USC, the polychaete collection and staff are                    still housed on the USC campus under extremely crowded                          conditions.  As part of its commitment to these collections and                 personnel, the LACM is presently constructing office/research                   space for the polychaete staff, and completely remodelling an                   expansive ground floor room to specifically accommodate                         compactors and rails for the polychaete and miscellaneous                       invertebrates collections.  With this collection space utilizing                compactors, the areas storage capacity can be fully minimized,                  allowing ample growth of the polychaete collection.  This project               will support the purchase and installation of all compactor                     rails, carriages, and shelves designed for this space.                          %%%                                                                             Collections of this sort are fundamentally important not only as                resources for primary research endeavors but also for a broad                   spectrum of other activities.  For example, specimens and their                 catalogues are essential resources for environmental impact                     assessment.  As well these collections provide valuable exhibit                 and educational opportunities with appeal to all levels of                      application.",
