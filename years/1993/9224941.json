 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224941  Oechel  This award supports Professor Walter C. Oechel and a graduate  student from San Diego State University to collaborate in  physiological ecology with Professor Bjartmar Sveinbjornsson and  others of the Institute of Biology of the University of Iceland.   They will study the long-term effects of elevated carbon dioxide  (CO2) on an arctic plant species (Nardus stricta) which is thought  to have evolved for thousands of years exposed to an elevated CO2  atmosphere near certain mineral springs in Iceland.  They will  characterize the physical environment around the springs and measure  a large number of physiological, organismal, and community level  features over time.  The U.S. team brings particular expertise in  studying physiological and ecosystem-level responses of plants to  CO2, and Dr. Oechel has extensive field experience in the arctic  regions of Alaska.  Dr. Sveinbjornsson is an expert in mosses and  has studied the effects of nutrient levels and water stress on  plants in arctic ecosystems.  Environmental measurements will be a  shared responsibility; studies of Nardus stricta will be done  principally by the U.S. participants, and complementary studies of a  moss species will be carried out by the Icelandic scientists.  The  collaborative nature of this project is essential to its success,  since no single research group has the necessary site access and  biological expertise.    The concentration of CO2 is increasing in the atmosphere due to the  burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.  Experimental research to  examine its effects on plant growth suggest that short-term exposure  to higher CO2 can stimulate growth, which has encouraged a number of  observers.  However, other more recent studies have demonstrated  that long term exposure (over a year) may have little or no positive  effect, and may even accelerate the depletion of other nutrients  needed by plants.  The mineral springs of Iceland make an excellent  and possibly unique model system for studying the  long-term effects  of elevated CO2 on vegetation in a natural environment with minimal  manipulation.  The proposed research has the potential to answer  important questions about how human-induced CO2 elevation will  affect world vegetation and carbon balance in the arctic.  ***",
