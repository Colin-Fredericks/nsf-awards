One class of problems concerns multi objective scheduling.  In the real world a scheduler usually has a number of objectives to take into account.  In order to develop a schedule he has to know the trade offs between the various objectives.  The research aims at developing algorithms for solving such multi objective problems as well as developing procedures for parametric analyses.  A second class of scheduling problems concerns problems with machine availability constraints.  In practice, machines are usually not continuously available for the jobs to be scheduled.  At times they may not be available because of preventive maintenance or other reasons.  The theoretical side of the research aims at developing scheduling algorithms which take machine availability constraints into account.          The project focuses on a number of issue on the applied side as well.  A prototype scheduling systems has been developed at Columbia University during the last three years.  A number of companies have a version of this system (including the source code) in their laboratories.",
