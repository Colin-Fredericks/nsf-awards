 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310553  Bickham and Dragoo       Although individual species of the family Mustelidae (weasels,  badgers, otters, and skunks) in the mammalian order Carnivora are  easy to recognize, taxonomic relationships among them and their  phylogenetic connections are problematic, with numerous conflicting  hypotheses based on morphological and chromosomal evidence.  The  diversity of morphological form, of behaviors, and of ecological  preferences among mustelids is thought to represent several  instances of parallel or convergent evolutionary change since the  Miocene.  The subfamily Mephitinae, the skunks, in particular is  recognized as extremely divergent and perhaps is the earliest  evolutionary lineage in the group.  The purpose of work by graduate  student Dragoo under the supervision of Dr. Bickham is to acquire  new DNA nucleotide sequence data for comparative analysis of  mutational difference among all species of skunks and among  representatives in the four other subfamilies of Mustelidae.  Both  mitochondrial and nuclear genes are targeted for analysis, to  provide evidence on both maternal lineages and biparental  inheritance.  %%%       Conflicting interpretations of traditional morphological  characters in mammal taxonomy have left unresolved the phylogeny of  the family Mustelidae, the weasels, badgers, otters, and skunks of  the world.  An independent and robust dataset of DNA nucleotide  sequences from both mitochondrial and nuclear genes will help  resolve this problem, and in turn provide direction for  evolutionary analysis of biogeography, behavioral changes, and  ecological shifts.",
