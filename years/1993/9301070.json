 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves applications of interacting particle                systems to biology.  In particular, the investigator will                       construct models to explain biological phenomena such as the                    temporal oscillations of measles and the patchiness of plankton                 in the sea.  Another area of interest is the connection with                    nonlinear partial differential equations.  By mixing the                        particles at a fast rate and scaling space, the system converges                to a nonlinear partial differential equation.  This makes it                    possible to derive partial differential equations that more                     accurately model the biological systems and also to prove results               about the particle systems with fast mixing.                                         Interacting particle systems have a structure that makes                   them appropriate for use in a variety of contexts in physics,                   chemistry, and biology.  There is a grid of sites, each of which                can have a fixed set of values.  For example, a city of                         individuals can be susceptible to, infected with, or immune to                  measles.  Each site changes its value at a rate that depends on                 the values of its neighbors, and this research is interested in                 determining what happens to the system over time.  These models                 should eventually provide a better understanding of global                      ecological problems.",
