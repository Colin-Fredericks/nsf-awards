This proposal deals with computational methods for parameter  estimation in distributed parameter systems.  Parameter  estimation is the process of determining coefficient functions,  typically for partial differential equations, from observations  of solutions.  The work of this project was made possible by  recent advances in scientific computing and image processing.  In  the field of image processing, the development of so-called  ``Total Variation'' based techniques enables the reconstruction  of much sharper images than was previously possible.  The  development of parallel computers allows the solution of complex  2- and 3-dimensional problems, which were previously intractable.   Direct applications of research in parameter estimation include  the improved reconstruction of images from electromagnetic,  thermal, and acoustic data.  Radar and sonar are perhaps the most  well-known examples.  Others include noninvasive medical imaging  techniques such as CAT scans, sonograms, and Magnetic Resonance  Imaging (MRI).  Seismic data processing, where recordings of  disturbances which have passed through the earth are used to  infer the internal structure of the earth, is yet another  important example.  Parameter estimation also plays a key role in  the development of mathematical models, i.e., mathematical  descriptions of physical phenomena.  These models are used to  describe processes ranging from the transport of toxic chemicals  through the soil to the spread of the AIDS epidemic.  ***",
