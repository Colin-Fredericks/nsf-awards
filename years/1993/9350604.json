Acquisition of this computer-                       controlled instrument with a wide spectral range, excellent                     resolution and extensive data manipulation capabilities will                    enhance the integrated laboratory program.  The instrument will                 allow students to do better structure determinations and obtain                 more and better data than is possible with their present                        instruments. Biology, biochemistry and chemistry majors will                    all benefit from the instrument. This spectrophotometer will                    also be used by research students both during the semesters and                 in the summer. Some high school students doing research in the                  summer are also expected to benefit. The instrument also be                     networked to improve the teaching in many of the chemistry                      lecture courses as well as in the discussion portions of the                    laboratory courses.",
