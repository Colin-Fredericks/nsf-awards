Landau, University of Georgia and Dr. Andrey I.                                 Milchev, University of Sofia.  It envisages an                                  ambitious program of research, designed to shed                                 light on the complex cooperative behavior of a                                  polydisperse system of semiflexible polymer                                     chains in the presence of an adsorbing surface.                                 Since the thermodynamic properties of such a                                    system are so far largely unknown, the                                          researchers believe that in a collaboration of                                  three years they can produce a sufficient number                                of results in order to get a complete picture of                                the phenomena in question.  The program of                                      research should focus on:  (1) Determination of                                 the order of the disorientation phase transition                                in 2D; (2) Establishment of a total phase diagram                               in the multiparameter space of the energy                                       interactions, temperature and density; (3)                                      Investigation of adsorption isotherms and the                                   adsorption-description phase transition for                                     polydisperse systems with different average chain                               length and stiffness; (4) Study of the density                                  profile and the structure of the polymer solution                               as a function of the distance from the adsorbing                                surface; (5) Investigation of the impact of                                     impurities on the thermodynamic and structural                                  properties of the system.                                                                                                                                       The problem is of major practical importance                                    since it has broad implications in lubrication,                                 adhesion, surface protection, etc. technology.                                  Polymers, adsorbed at the surface of colloid                                    particles, lead to (steric) stabilization of the                                colloid suspension which is important for dyes                                  production.                                                                                                                                                     This research in materials theory fulfills the                                  program objective of advancing science by                                       enabling leading experts in the United States and                               Bulgaria to combine complementary talents and                                   pool research resources in areas of strong mutual                               interest and competence.",
