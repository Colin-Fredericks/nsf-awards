 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three problems in gastropod biology serve as the focus for                 this research on metamorphosis and morphological diversity.  First,             development and functional significance of modifications to shell               apertures of many marine gastropod species when in the planktic                 veliger larval stage (the sinusigeral larval form) will be studied.             Second, developmental causes of an unusual mechanical deformation               occurring in larval shells of some primitive marine gastropod                   species are to be investigated.  A third topic relates to                       characterizing and evaluating the diversity of sequential events                and timing involved in development of trochoidean gastropods, with              the specific goal of translating data into characters and character             states useful for phylogenetic analysis; such descriptors should be             useful in tandem with more traditional morphological characters.                %%%                                                                             This work will inform persistent and unresolved problems of                     molluscan evolutionary morphology.  The first two problems reside               in the realm of functional and evolutionary interpretation of                   features of the larval shell and its relationship to the adult                  shell, for which solutions require developmental information                    gathered in a comparative systematic way.  Both questions are                   relevant to phenomena observable in shells of living and fossil                 gastropods.  Addressing the third problem would cultivate a                     consistent language of characters and character states that                     translate the rich vocabulary of developmental biology into a                   language for systematics and phylogenetic analysis.",
