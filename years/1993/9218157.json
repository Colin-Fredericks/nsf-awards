 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the end of their active lives, most stars become large, very                 cool but bright red giants.  As they finish this stage, many begin              to lose their outer layers through outflows known as winds.  It is              thought that an important factor driving these winds is the                     formation of small solid particles commonly referred to as dust.                The role played by this dust in driving the outflow and the                     dynamics of such outflows will be investigated.  An investigation               will also be conducted of the effects on the wind of the presence               of a binary companion to the star in question.  Submillimeter                   observations will be undertaken to verify some of the predictions               of the theory.  Since the strong winds from red giants completely               alter the evolution of the stars and provide enriched material to               the interstellar medium, this work has broad ramifications to                   several areas of astronomy.",
