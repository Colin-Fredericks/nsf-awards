The 1993 expedition will involve U.S. scientists from  several institutions and scientists from Russia's Institute of  Global Climate and Ecology in Moscow.  The expedition will focus on  the biogeochemical cycles of contaminants, related oceanographic  processes, food-web interactions in North Pacific waters flowing  through the area, and behavior of organic pollutants at the  water/sediment interface.  Geographic areas of study will range  from the continental shelves of the Bering and Chukchi Seas to the  deep Bering Sea.  Intensive biological sampling locations will  include several long-term monitoring sites (polygons) that have  been visited four times since 1977.  The Russian-American research  is comprehensive and highly integrated  and the data will be of  interest to the Divisions of Ocean Sciences and Polar Programs.  ***",
