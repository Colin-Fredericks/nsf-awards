 "awd_abstract_narration": "Designing a constitution involves one of the most critical and                  complex series of explicit decisions that a society can confront.               Should the government be presidential or parliamentary; should it               have a two-house or single-chamber legislature; should there be any             differences in the powers of the chambers of a bicameral                        legislature; should representation be territorial or by                         proportional representation; what role should the courts play in                constitutional interpretation; what provisions should be included               for emergencies; what authority should be given to local and                    regional governments; what rights properly belong in a                          constitution?                                                                   Large and ethnically heterogeneous states confront an additional                series of questions, including:  Should the country be federal or               unitary, and if it is federal, should its constituent parts have                the right to secede, to veto legislation, or to nullify federal law             on their territories?  These last questions are important not only              because they influence the operation and stability of a state after             it has formed, but also, as in the case of countries such as Russia             and Ukraine, they can influence whether a viable constitution can               be written and implemented in the first place.  With various                    republics and regions of Russia, for example, claiming autonomy,                sovereignty, and even independence and secession, it may not be                 possible to implement a constitution that does not provide for the              right to secession.                                                             Unfortunately, we do not know very much empirically or                          theoretically about the implications of including a secession right             in a constitution.  Nor do we know the extent to which other                    provisions, such as allowing subunits the right to veto or                      nullification.  Which device (secession, veto, nullification)                   provides a constituent unit of a federalism the greatest guarantee              against violation of its rights and which, if any, fosters the                  development of a mutually beneficial federal state?                             This research investigation explores such questions by drawing a                theoretical parallel between federations and alliances in                       international political systems.  The rationale for this parallel               is that alliances, like federations, must be consummated and                    maintained on a wholly voluntary basis.  As such, alliances contain             within them the right to secession and veto (and, in some                       instances, nullification).  At the same time, in joining an                     alliance, each member must relinquish some of its sovereignty to a              central, coordinating agent, or at least state a verbal (but                    possibly non-enforceable) agreement to do so.  By developing some               common ideas and theoretical principles, the researchers hope to                show how alliances and federations operate under the same                       principles and how the properties of unstable alliances parallel                and are different from stable and unstable federations.  Finally,               by looking at alliances, it is possible to gain a clearer view of               the way in which the right of secession might operate in a                      constitutional democracy.",
