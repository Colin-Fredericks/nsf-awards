 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turtles exhibit intermittent ventilatory patterns in which brief                periods of ventilation are interspersed with apneas of variable                 duration.  Associated with this ventilatory pattern are cyclic                  changes in pulmonary and systemic blood flow.  Due to the anatomy               of the heart, these changes in blood flow may be associated with                both right-to-left (R-L; pulmonary bypass) and left-to-right (L-R;              pulmonary recirculation) intracardiac shunting.  These                          cardiovascular changes can influence pulmonary gas exchange,                    affecting both CO2 and O2 transport.  The functional significance               of intracardiac shunting has remained primarily speculative.  This              study will determine the physiological role of intracardiac                     shunting during intermittent ventilation in turtles.  Specifically              the study will determine; 1) the flow ratios between the pulmonary              and systemic circuits (i.e. R-L and L-R shunts) during ventilation              and apnea and 2) the effects of cholinergic and adrenergic blockade             on the direction and magnitude of intracardiac shunt and correlate              these effects with changes in ventilatory patterns, pulmonary gas               exchanged and blood gas transport.  Studies will be conducted in                the turtle, Pseudemys scripta, in vivo at 25oC.  All objectives                 will be accomplished in chronically instrumented, freely diving,                spontaneously ventilating animals.  Continuous measurements of                  pulmonary and systemic blood flows, ventilation, gas exchange, lung             gases and blood gases will be made.  The results will be analyzed               within the context of several current hypotheses addressing the                 respiratory \"benefits\" of intracardiac shunting.  The hypotheses                presented are not necessarily novel, however, the experiments                   outlined in this proposal will for the first time specifically                  examine the functional significance of this distinctive type of                 cardiovascular regulation.",
