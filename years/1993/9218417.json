 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Donald Grayson, Mr Jack Broughton will               collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will analyze                     faunal materials from archaeological sites in the San Francisco                 Bay region of California and use this information to reconstruct                patterns of changing environment and human subsistence over an                  approximately 4,000 year period. Since the beginning of this                    century archaeologists have directed attention to the numerous                  shellmound sites located in the Bay region. Many of these mounds                were of tremendous size, measuring up to 100 x 300 meters across                and as much as 9.8 meters in depth. Excavations of them have                    documented thousands of years of human prehistory and because of                the abundant mammal remains it is possible to examine how human                 diet changed over time. Mr Broughton will study faunal materials                from a number of sites. In addition to identifying bones by                     species, he will measure then to reconstruct body size. In this                 way he will be able to determine the effect of human predation on               prey populations. Using ideas derived from optimum foraging                     theory he has predicted how degree of predation should be                       reflected in these remains.                                                                                                                                     This research is of significance for several reasons. First it                  will increase our understanding of how prehistoric U.S.                         populations subsisted and adapted to environmental conditions                   over thousands of years. Of equal importance is what it may                     reveal about the population dynamics of animals such as sea                     otter, deer and elk. It appears that at some times in the past -                such as when the first Spanish explorers entered the region -                   herds of deer and elk were enormous. At other times in the more                 distant past such species appear to be less common and Mr.                      Broughton wishes to determine the extent to which human predation               was responsible. This research should not only increase our                     understanding of the past but also suggest optimum game                         management strategies. It will also assist in the training of a                 promising young scientist.",
