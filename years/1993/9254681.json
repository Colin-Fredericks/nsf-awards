 "awd_abstract_narration": "SOUNDPRINT, the weekly half-hour nationally broadcast public                    radio documentary series, proposes a 16-program SOUNDPRINT                      SCIENCE SERIES comprising four thematic components of four                      programs each, which explore and examine current issues and                     ideas in the areas of 1) Biodiversity and Species Management;                   2) Invasions:  The Predator and the Prey; 3) Cultural                           Geography; and 4) The Meanings of Science.                                                                                                                      The series offers listeners a variety of experiences                            illustrative of the breadth of what is defined as science.                      Scientific thought and method are presented through a                           humanistic storytelling approach that capitalizes on the                        imaginative quality of sound to immerse listeners in the                        exploration of phenomena.  Each documentary explores a single                   subject, placing it in a meaningful context, and taking                         listeners beyond the surface of simple fact reporting.                          Programs translate complex scientific ideas into accessible,                    memorable stories that increase awareness and understanding of                  science for a broad population (SOUNDPRINT REACHES OVER                         250,000 LISTENERS EACH WEEK).                                                                                                                                   The SOUNDPRINT SCIENCE SERIES will be broad cast as a series                    of quarterly, month-long specials, with promotional, education                  and community outreach materials provided to stations.  Post-                   broadcast application of the programs includes development of                   teacher guide packets targeted to the middle school level and                   repacking of programs for educational purposes in multi-media                   and interactive settings.  Cassette copies of programs are                      shared by listeners in professional, educational, and informal                  settings.                                                                                                                                                       Major scientific disciplines involved include: biology,                         environmental sciences, geography, life sciences, mathematics                   and physics.                                                                                                                                                    The Proposed SOUNDPRINT SCIENCES SERIES is submitted to the                     National Science Foundation Informal Science Education                          Program.                                                                                                                                                        Programs in the series are geared to a broad, general                           audience, elementary through adult populations.",
