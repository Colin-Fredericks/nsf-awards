 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will study two different classes of problems                 for Markov processes. The first is a study of the asymptotic                    distribution of certain generalized occupation time formulas for                special classes of Markov processes.  The investigator has                      recently obtained generalized arcsine laws for occupation times                 of one dimensional Levy processes in joint work with M.J.Sharpe.                He will attempt to find higher dimensional analogues of these                   results.  The second class of problems deals with the potential                 theory of a general Markov process. In a recent monograph the                   principal investigator has shown that for many purposes excessive               measures are more fundamental than excessive functions. He plans                to continue his investigation of the potential theory of                        excessive measures. In particular the connection with capicitary                measures and excursion theory.                                                       This research is in the area of Markov processes. A Markov                 process is a mathematical model of how certain random phenomena                 evolve in time. Examples are the diffusion of a gas or liquid, or               the motion of a collidal particle in a liquid subject to                        molecular bombardment. This last example is called Brownian                     motion. Surprisingly the mathematical model for Brownian motion                 also turns out to be of fundamental importance in potential                     theory which encompasses electrostatic potentials and equilibrium               temperature distributions in solids among other things.",
