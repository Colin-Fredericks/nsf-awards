The languages are fully                       declarative and based on solid mathematical foundations.  The                   language for general purpose programming admits (unlike PROLOG and              its currently existing generalizations) extended syntax: general                quantifiers and a functional form of classical negation.  This                  language is used as a basis from which the others are developed.                The second language for expert systems has an intrinsic support for             non-numerical measures of confidence and formal mechanisms for                  handling hierarchies of contradictions.  The third language for                 deductive databases supports multiple open and closed domains and               efficient query evaluation.  The fourth language combines features              of the previous two, and is suitable for distributed multi-                     component intelligent systems.  The languages have a potential for              parallelization.  This research is based on a theory recently                   developed by the investigator and extended to support the features              above.  In this research, experimental implementations are also                 produced to allow validation of the theory and comparisons of                   efficiency with corresponding implementations of other languages.               No languages with proposed features currently exist; their                      introduction will have a desirable impact on the construction of                future intelligent systems.",
