 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306265  Hale       The thrust of this proposal is to continue to develop the  theory of infinite dimensional dissipative systems by the  consideration of specific types of problems.  For example, in  Partial Differential Equations, we study the dependence of the  flows upon parameters, concentrating on the boundary conditions,  diffusion coefficients, dissipation coefficients and the shape of  the domain.  Comparison of flows defined by such equations will  be restricted mostly to the global attractors.  For Functional  Differential Equations, we will be primarily interested in  singular  perturbation problems which relate the solutions to the  properties of maps defined by limit equations.       Many physical systems are modeled by partial differential  equations defined on a bounded domain.  The study of the effects  of the domain (its shape, etc.) on the dynamics is of paramount  importance.  This is especially true if the geometric properties  ofl the domain act as a control variable, as, for example, those  included under lthe name lof optimal shape design, as well as  others.  Also, many domains are small in some directions and it  is advantageous to make a reduction to a lower dimensional domain  for design as well as computational purposes. The present  proposal addresses questions of this type.  In lazer optics and  models in ecology and biology, one encounters singularly  perturbed delay differential equations.  In such cases, the limit  equation for the singularly perturbed parameter equal to zero  is mapping.  We address in this proposal the relationships  between the dynamics of the delay equation and the dynamics of  the map.  ***",
