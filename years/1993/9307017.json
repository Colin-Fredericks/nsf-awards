 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Vema fracture zone is the northernmost of the slow-                    spreading, long-offset transform faults along the Mid-Atlantic                  Ridge at the latitude of the bulge of Africa. The morphology of the             fracture zone is dominated by a flat-flooded, sediment-filled                   valley and a transform-parallel transverse ridge that towers 2 to               4 km above the valley floor. A recent series of divers by the                   French submersible Nautile has shown that the northern flank of the             transverse ridge exposes all of the principal units of the oceanic              crust. This project seeks to understand why the transverse ridge                has been uplifted above the adjoining seafloor, and to exploit the              existence of this uplift by examining a section through the oceanic             crust exposed on the northern flank of the transverse ridge. The                project will begin by mapping a 200 km long section of the                      transverse ridge with Hydrosweep and with LDGO's multispectral                  near-bottom-town side-looking sonar system. The objectives are: (1)             to map the network of faults along which vertical motion has                    occurred; (2) to determine whether Vema transverse ridge is                     symmetrical in composition and structure; (3) to map the geometry               and extent of the shallow water limestone cap on the transverse                 ridge; (4) to along-strike variability in the thickness of crustal              units, and the crustal section as a whole; (5) to image the                     contacts between crust and upper mantle and among crustal units;                and (6) to map dip and strike of sheeted dikes outcropping in the               transverse ridge.",
