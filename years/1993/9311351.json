 "awd_abstract_narration": "Leslie  9311531    Underrepresentation of minorities and women in science and  engineering fields is a matter of major national interest and  social concern.  The purpose of the study is to identify and  quantify, through econometric analysis, variables explaining majors  to graduation, and entrance into graduate S/E programs and S/E  careers.  The primary focus will be on females and minorities, but  majority males will be examined as well.  Previous research has  efforts for minorities and women have been sparse and limited in  scope.  A full array of variables will be examined including market  factors.    Data for the study will be extracted primarily from the National  Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS72), High  School and Beyond (HS&B), and the longitudinal studies of the UCLA  Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP), which will  provide data for the S/E undergraduate choice and persistence  analyses and persistence analyses and some data for the S/E  graduate program and career choice analyses.  Other data bases for  use in S/E graduate program and career choice analyses may include  NSF's, The Experienced Sample of Scientists and Engineers, the  Survey of Recent Scientists and Engineers, the Survey of Doctorate  Recipients, and the Scholastic Aptitude and Graduate Record Files.    Analytical techniques include, for selection of major or  occupational choice, determining the probabilities of various  choices for distinct groups, e.g., females or males, and then  determining the choices other groups would make based on specified  probabilities.  The gender differences in the distribution among  choices reflect gender differences in the explanatory variables.   Multinomial logit or, alternately, a conditional logit model is  used to analyze choice of college S/E major.  Multinomial probit is  also used if independence assumptions are not satisfied.  For  analyzing persistence, Markov or multinomial logit choice model, is  used.  Early job history is modeled  as a simple logit choice model,  while choice of S/E graduate program will be analyzed using a basic  choice framework or multinomial choice framework.  Choice of given  model or analytical technique will be dependent on satisfying the  assumptions of the model or technique.",
