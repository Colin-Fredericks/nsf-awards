 "awd_abstract_narration": "A revolutionary teaching microscope will be introduced into the                 introductory biology laboratory classroom as part of a major                    revision of the curriculum. The efficiency and dramatic effect                  of this instrument has been demonstrated in a pilot project,                    Exploring Microstructures: Introducing Biology Students and                     Teachers to Images, Tools and Applications of High-Tech                         Microscopy. The technologically-advanced microscope consists of                 a tiny, hand-held, self-illuminated video camera with                           interchangeable magnifying lenses attached by a fiber optics                    cable to a television monitor. By touching the tip of the lens                  to any object under scrutiny, a user of any age or ability                      immediately produces a well-lighted, in-focus image of the                      appropriate magnification on a regular television monitor. This                 tool will improve the investigative biology laboratory for non-                 science majors. Video recordings can be made in the normal                      fashion.The number of applications that can be developed is                     virtually unlimited and will serve as a generator of ideas for                  K-12 as well as undergraduate curricula. The preliminary                        excitement elicited by the entry of our pilot scope into K-12                   and undergraduate classrooms merits the expansion of the                        program into this larger scale project.",
