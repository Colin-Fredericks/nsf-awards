 "awd_abstract_narration": "Benthic studies in the northern Bering Sea indicate that the Gulf               of Anadyr cold pool, which has apparently shifted over the past                 decade, has an important influence on benthic community                         structure. This research will integrate benthic studies of this                 feature with a recently completed appraisal of the importance of                the nearby St. Lawrence island polynya on benthic communities.                  This appraisal indicated that there were significant differences                in benthic biomass, sediment respiration, tunicate cellulose                    oxygen-18 content, sediment lipid content, and bottom chlorophyll               values between nearshore benthic communities most directly                      affected by the polynya, compared to the offshore benthos. These                findings indicate that the presence of the open-water polynya in                the winter contributes to benthic productivity south of St.                     Lawrence island. This work also suggested, however, that the                    presence of the Gulf of Anadyr cold pool had an even more                       important physical influence; it appears to be associated with                  the most productive benthic communities (as measured by sediment                respiration and benthic biomass) in the northern Bering Sea. This               research will conduct detailed studies of the nearshore benthos                 southwest of St. Lawrence Island and within the Gulf of Anadyr                  cold pool, with the goal of characterizing the influence of this                feature on ecosystem function in the Bering Sea benthos. Benthic                production is extremely important in the shallow Bering Sea, and                more detailed knowledge of its role will contribute significantly               to our understanding of the Arctic marine ecosystem.",
