 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA processing is known to control key steps in the growth and                  differentiation of organisms.  In mammals and yeasts, regulation of             alternative mRNA 3' end processing can generate structurally                    transcripts that produce different polypeptide isoforms.                        Polyadenylation appears to be a determinant of mRNA stability and               specific changes in poly(A) tail length have been correlated with               translational efficiency.  In T.brucei mitochondria, transcript                 levels, polyadenylation and RNA editing are all differentially                  regulated, indicating the important role RNA processing plays in                the biogenesis of this organelle.  However, very little is known                about the mechanisms which control these processes or how they                  interact in the ultimate regulation of gene expression.  With the               development of a system to investigate precursor and cleavage, the              dissection of these mechanisms and the understanding of how RNA                 processing can regulate mitochondrial biogenesis can be greatly                 expanded.                                                                       %%%                                                                             Kinetoplasted protozoa have provided amazingly fertile ground for               the study of novel molecular phenomena such as trans-splicing, bent             DNA and de novo circular gene amplifications.  Probably the most                surprising discovery, however, is the phenomena of RNA editing                  which occurs in the mitochondria of these organisms.  If as has                 been suggested, RNA editing reflects an old mechanism and is a                  direct descendent of RNA replication, understanding how this system             interacts with other RNA processing machineries in its regulation               may give us a much broader understanding of basic genetic                       regulatory processes.",
