 "awd_abstract_narration": "9214441  Bennett  This award will provide funding for the renovation of areas in  existing facilities for undergraduate research and research  training in biology, chemistry and geoscience at Hobart and  William Smith Colleges.  The existing structures, Lansing and  Eaton Halls, were built in 1952 and 1961 as conventional  facilities for undergraduate science instruction and are  currently inadequate for the mission of the institution that all  students pursuing scientific disciplines be involved in research  training, independently and in collaboration with research  faculty.  Laboratories are deficient in size, configuration,  technical specifications, safety provisions and are not  accessible to handicap students and faculty.  Due to overcrowded  conditions in the laboratories, the number of students that can  be accommodated is limited.  Research space competes with  instrumentation and equipment storage, further eroding the  functionality of the existing space.    In addition to refurbishing laboratory space, renovations will  include installing new fume hoods, upgrading the electrical and  plumbing systems and removing all hazardous materials that make  for an unsafe environment.  The modernization and enhancement of  the Colleges' facilities for research and research training in  the sciences will therefore contribute directly to the pipeline  of college graduates entering the nation's base of scientific  personnel, expanding access in the process to women and  individuals of diverse ethnic background.  ***",
