 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308394  THILL       The importance of constraints in spatial choice by  individuals is widely recognized in geography and related  disciplines, but relatively little attention has focused on the  development of empirically verified models of spatial choice that  effectively incorporate constraints.  A potentially fruitful line  of inquiry is the identification of destinations selected by  travelers when travel time and other constraints are imposed on  the spatial decision-making process.  This project will examine  the impacts of constraints on destination choice through  development and testing of models based on random-utility theory.  Tractable specifications of random-utility models that include  the effects of travel time and other constraints will be  identified, with special attention given to analysis of the  effect of constraints on formation of the sets from which  travelers choose their destinations.  The models developed in  initial phases of this project will be tested using detailed data  on non-work travel behavior taken at ten-year intervals over two  decades in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.       This project will contribute to development of models of  destination choice that more realistically account for behavioral  variations among individuals, especially with respect to the role  of constraints in the selection of destinations.  Through model  development and empirical testing, general knowledge of spatial  decision making will be advanced.  The results of this research  also will have practical advantages for transportation planning.  ***",
