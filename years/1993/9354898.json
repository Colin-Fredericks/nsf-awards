Oberlin College and Valparaiso University, both with active  programs to recruit women and ethnic minority undergraduates, will  be feeder schools for the Graduate Research Traineeship (GRT)  program.  Indiana University will provide enhanced stipends to  recruit and retain women and ethnic minority students who might not  otherwise choose a scientific career.  The Computer Science  Department will ensure degree completion with additional advising  and mentoring activities.    The GRT fellows' analytical skills, inter-disciplinary breadth, and  rigorous empiricism will be developed through coursework,  collaborations with faculty and senior graduate students at Indiana  University, and an external research semester in the Santa Fe  Institute's program in adaptive computation.    The experimental component of the training program is solidly  founded on the department's innovative research, which has produced  the inexpensive miniature hexapod robot Stiquito, and analog VLSI  Lukasiewicz logic arrays that are being applied as sensors,  inference engines, and controllers for the robot.  GRT fellows will  study the principles of adaptive computation, systems  implementation, and mobile robotics by simulating, building, and  experimenting with Stiquito colonies.  ***",
