They are studying some fundamental  microscopic aspects of plant cell structure that change  as the cells respond to unfavorable environmental stress.   The combined talents of the U.S. participants in protein  biochemistry and plant pathology and the German  scientists' expertise in cytology and genetics create an  unusually strong team to work on understanding the  intracellular processes in stressed plants.    Plant cells have membranes inside them adjacent but not  connected to the cell walls that react to some types of  stress by adhering to the cell walls.  These  investigators are attempting to understand the mechanisms  for that adhesion by examining the individual protein  constituents of the membrane-wall adhesion complex.  By  characterizing the components, they will obtain  information necessary for understanding the adhesion  process, and perhaps controlling it in useful ways to  improve plants' reaction to saline stress and pathogen  attack.  ***",
