White, University of Texas at Austin.  The                                   researchers will investigate photo-induced                                      reactions including oxidation of alkyl radicals                                 and activation of unsaturated hydrocarbons.                                     Their experiments will be carried out under                                     ultra-high vacuum conditions at low temperature,                                where the thermal effects can be minimized.                                     Adsorbed species will be characterized, before                                  and after irradiation, by a number of surface                                   sensitive techniques.  The researchers will also                                characterize supported noble metals which play                                  important roles in many catalytic processes.                                                                                                                    This research in chemistry fulfills the US-                                     Hungary Joint Fund's objective of advancing                                     science by enabling leading experts in the United                               States and Hungary to combine complementary                                     talents and pool research resources in areas of                                 strong mutual interest and competence.",
