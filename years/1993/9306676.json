 "awd_abstract_narration": "This career advancement award provides partial support for Dr.                  Champness during a sabbatical leave at the John Innes Institute in              Norwich, United Kingdom.  Streptomycetes are well-known for their               capacity to synthesize a vast repertoire of secondary metabolites               (antibiotics).  Besides their commercial importance, the                        Streptomyces are interesting for their complex developmental cycle.             In the course of this life cycle, antibiotic synthesis is                       developmentally regulated.  The objective of the research in this               proposal is to define aspects of the global genetic regulation of               Streptomyces coelicolor antibiotic synthesis.  The research planned             is based on a set of genes, recently discovered in Dr. Champness                laboratory, which regulate the expression of antibiotic genes.  The             major goal is investigation of the mechanism by which these genes               globally regulate antibiotic synthesis.                                         %%%                                                                             This molecular analysis promises to contribute not only to our                  understanding of microbial developmental gene regulation, but also              to biotechnology.  Understanding of S. coelicolor regulation is                 highly likely to explain much of antibiotic regulation in other                 Streptomycetes and Actinomycetes, and thus increase the potential               for rational manipulation of production of commercially important               metabolites including the many new metabolites that are                         continuously being discovered.",
