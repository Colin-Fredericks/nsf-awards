 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will (1) determine fish diversity and distribution in               the remnant rainforest and coastal plains of Madagascar; (2)                    assess, for conversion and sustainable use purposes, the status                 of scientifically and commercially important native fish species;               (3) study fish ecology and physical and chemical habitat                        characteristics of the Madagascar rivers: (4) produce a checklist               and database of the fishes of Madagascar for in-country                         conservation planning; (5) provide research and teaching                        collections (preserved specimens frozen and alcohol tissues) to                 Madagascar and US institutions for future biodiversity, molecular               systematic, and ecological studies, and for in-country and US                   training of students.  Madagascar fish are highly endemic,                      paralleling the endemism of the rest of of that African island                  fauna.  Many of the fish lineages are ancient, with their own                   origin dating to the geologic rifting of Madagascar from the                    African mainland about 80 million years ago.  The fish fauna;                   however, is poorly known and studied, and its diversity is                      severely threatened by deforestation and the introduction of                    foreign species.  Many of the surveyed and sampled fish will be                 new to science.  This project has US partners (World Wide Fund                  for Nature, World Wildlife Fund, Conservation International) and                extensive Madagascar collaboration (scientists and students at                  the University Antananarivo; Parc Botanique et Zoologique de                    Tsimbazaza, Perinet Faunal Reserve, Ranomafauna National Park).                 This biodiversity study is extremely urgent and has the full                    permitting and logistical support od Madagascar officials.                      %%%                                                                             By virtue of its more than 80 million years of isolation,                       Madagascar has developed among the most unique plants and animals               on earth.  This project will survey the freshwater fish of the                  rainforest and coastal plain rivers of Madagascar, many of which                are highly endemic and threatened by habitat extinction.  Many of               these fish lineages are ancient, with the origin dating to the                  geologic rifting of Madagascar from the African mainland about 80               million years ago.  The project will also assess, for                           conservation and sustainable use purposes, the status of                        scientifically and commercially important native fish species.                  The Madagascar fauna and flora is disappearing at a desperate                   pace -- for example, only 10 to 15% of the original rainforests                 are left.  This support will enable the goals of sustainable                    development and conservation of biodiversity, building up                       Madagascar's scientific capacity in biodiversity research and                   strengthening long-term collaborative research linkages between                 US and Malagasy scientists.",
