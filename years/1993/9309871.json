 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309871  ARLEN  This project will conduct the first economic analysis of the impact  of criminal sanctions on corporations' expenditures on crime  prevention and detection (\"enforcement\").  Corporate enforcement  costs warrant consideration because a central goal of corporate  criminal sanctions is to deter criminal activity by inducing  corporations to spend resources on preventing employee crime.  The  first section of the project will consider the current trend in  sentencing reform towards increased criminal fines for corporate  offenders, and the validity of the conventional wisdom that higher  criminal fines increase corporations' willingness to spend  resources to prevent their employees from committing crimes.  The  project then will determine what magnitude of corporate criminal  fine induces corporations to spend the efficient amount of  resources on crime prevention and detection under the current  regime of strict vicarious corporate liability.      This project can be expected to yield important insights because  its focus on corporate enforcement expenditures forces recognition,  for the first time, of corporations' conflicting incentives.  On  the one hand, criminal liability increases a corporation's  incentives to spend resources on crime detection because these  expenditures deter employees from committing crimes; on the other  hand, corporations recognize that their enforcement efforts may  increase the probability that their agents' crimes will be  detected, thereby increasing the probability that the corporation  itself will be subject to criminal liability.  The Principal  Investigator will employ mathematical modelling techniques.  ***",
