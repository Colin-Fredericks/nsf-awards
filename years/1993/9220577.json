 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recombination, the production of progeny with new combinations of               genes, is one of the basic activities of genetic material at all                levels of the biological kingdom.  The basic mechanisms of                      recombination are not completely understood in any species, but                 much has been learned in recent years by a combination of molecular             and genetic studies in yeast.  The generality of these findings is              uncertain, and there is a need for parallel studies in other                    eukaryotes.  The mtr gene of Neurospora offers special advantages               for studies of mutation and recombination.  Rare segregants can be              efficiently detected going in either direction; wildtype to mutant              or mutant to wildtype.  The gene hs been cloned and sequenced.  A               detailed analysis of spontaneous mutation is being completed which              has involved the sequencing of 63 different mtr mutants.  This                  system can now be used for a detailed molecular description of                  meiotic recombination.                                                          %%%                                                                             Recombination, the production of progeny with new combinations of               genes, is one of the basic activities of genetic material at all                levels of the biological kingdom.

The generality of these findings is              uncertain, and there is a need for parallel studies in other                    organisms.  This study of recombination in the filamentous fungus               Neurospora will make a significant contribution toward meeting this             need.",
