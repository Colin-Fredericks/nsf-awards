 "awd_abstract_narration": "Investigation of the use of resonance-enhanced multiphoton                      ionization spectroscopy and time-of-flight mass spectrometry                    (REMPI/TOFMS) for the continuous monitoring of stack gas                        emissions from hazardous waste incinerators will be carried                     out.  In this program, the potential of the REMPI/TOFMS method                  for repetitive on-line monitoring of numerous species chosen                    from a list of currently identified surrogates will be                          investigated; the effort will combine detailed spectroscopic                    measurements of fundamental importance in understanding                         molecular structures with measurements of detection limits and                  selectivities needed for practical application of the                           technique.  The apparatus to be used is a prototype of a                        potential portable sampling and detection system envisioned                     for on-line real-time monitoring at an incineration facility.                   Particular emphasis will be placed on one- and two-color REMPI                  spectroscopic studies of chlorinated polycyclic aromatics;                      analyses of the vibronic spectral signatures of these species                   will be carried out.  Since  formation and destruction of                       congeners of the chlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofurans                   are expected to follow siminar pathways, spectroscopy of the                    less toxic, more abundant mono- and di-chlorinated species                      will receive high priority.  Due to the importance of                           chlorinatef congeners of phenol as precursors to the formation                  of PCDDs and PCDFs, studies of detection limits and                             sensitivities for mono- and di-chlorinated phenols will also                    be carried out.  Selectivity and detection limit measurements                   for two-color R2PI of biphenyl, p-dichlorobiphenyl,                             phenylphenol(4-hydroxybiphenyl), chloro-phenylphenon,                           phenanthrene, anthracene, and pyrene will also be made.                         Finally, studies of REMPI spectroscopy of dibenzo-p-dioxin,                     dibenzofuran, and several of their mono- and di-chlorinated                     congeners will be carried out.                                                                                                                                  The spectral sensitivity of REMPI, realizable with jet-cooling                  of the sample, eliminates the need for time-consuming                           capillary column sample separation of conventional GC/MS                        analysis procedures which are considered to be impractical for                  use in continuous emission monitoring of incinerator                            effluents.  It is anticipated that the potential of                             REMPI/TOFMS for real-time on-line repetitive monitoring of                      trace concentrations of wide classes of chlorinated organics,                   including polycyclic aromatic compounds, may help address                       current public health concerns and produce more effective and                   simplified licensing procedures for incinerators.",
