 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lawrence Kool    9310198    This is an attempt to develop a method to convert alkanes directly  to partially oxidized products using a platinum catalyst and an  aqueous  transition-metal oxidant.  The approach differs from  currently available methods in that it does not require molecular  oxygen.  This effort includes a critical evaluation of the  platinum/aqueous ferric system covering experimental variables,  selectivity at high conversion, and elucidation of the mechanism,  which is thought to involve an alkylplatinum hydride intermediate;  catalyst support effects; substitution of palladium for platinum;  the use of various aqueous transition-metal oxidants; and the  design, synthesis, and evaluation of soluble organoplatinum  complexes that may model the carbon-hydrogen bond cleavage on the  platinum surface.    Direct partial oxidation of light alkanes (methane, propane,  natural gas, etc.) is an important objective of catalytic  technology; current methods are either very limited in scope or are  cumbersome multistep processes.  The products of such processes,  such as methanol, ethanol, formaldehyde, acetic acid, etc., have  many uses as chemical feedstocks, fuels, or monomers, or they can  be further processed to improve existing fuels.  Although there is  much work toward this objective, the approach in this work is a  radical departure from conventional efforts.  This is a  collaboration with A. E. Shilov at the Institute of Chemical  Physics in Chernogolovka, Russia.",
