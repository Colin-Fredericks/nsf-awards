 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Thomas Hayden is jointly funded by a grant from the                   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program, the                            Computational Biology Program, the Biophysics Program, and the                  Computational Mathematics Program to continue his theoretical                   research in the application of distance geometry to the                         interpretation of NMR spectra.  Data from NMR experiments                       provide lower and upper bounds on the values of interactomic                    distances allowed by the ensemble of conformations of a                         molecule.  Distance geometry can be used to improve these                       bounds by methods known as bound smoothing.  New applications                   of distance geometry to bound smoothing are being investigated.                  Specific geometric structures and their relationship to                        certain classes of distance matrices are being carried out.                     One goal of understanding this relationship is to suggest                       possible conformations that can serve as a template for the                     design by a pharmaceutical chemist of rigid drug analogues                      which are active at a specific receptor site.                                   %%%                                                                             Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques are rapidly                         evolving which will enable chemists to determine the                            3-dimensional structures of large protein and nucleic acids in                  solution.  These techniques provide an important complement to                  the more well-established X-ray crystallographic methods.  The                  primary results which are obtained from such NMR experiments                    are internuclear distances between selected hydrogen atoms in                   the backbone of the protein molecule.  Distance geometry                        methods, such as those being developed by Hayden, provide the                   primary mathematical tools which are used to determine the                      3-dimensional geometry from these distance constraints.",
