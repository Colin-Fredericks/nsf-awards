 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304843  Edmond       Unrestricted access and sampling is currently possible in the  great rivers of the Russian Far East.  Two very successful  expeditions have taken place to the Aldan, the major tributary of  the Upper Lena (1991), and to the Kolyma (1992).  All significant  tributaries were sampled for water chemistry and for their  suspended and bed material.  The data now available for the Aldan  system clearly show the effects of frost cracking in accelerating  weathering in this periglacial environment.  The Archean Aldan  Shield appears to weather at rates at least an order of magnitude  faster than its Tropical analogue, The Guayana Shield in the  Orinoco drainage.  Similarily the rates of weathering of the  platform carbonates of the Lena Plateau are not inhibited by the  low temperatures.  Concentration levels during the period of summer  flow are comparable to those of the Yangtze, which drains  geologically similar terrain.  These comparison give insight on the  effects of climatic deterioration on the geochemical cycle, a topic  of much general interest at the present time.  It is planned to  extend this work to the main stem of the Upper Lena and to the  other large rivers of the region, the Indigrika, Yana, Anadyr and  Amur.  ***",
