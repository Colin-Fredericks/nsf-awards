Olson  of the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, and Dr. Lubomir Brokl of the Institute of  Sociology of the Czech Academy of Sciences.  It will be held in Prague during August 1994  and will involve ten participants from the United States, ten from the Czech Republic and the  Slovak Republic and seven from other countries in Central Europe.  The workshop itself will  feature country papers as well as specialized sessions on methodological and topical matters.   The overall objective is to examine the course of development of parliament(s) as a whole  institution during the beginning phases of a new post-communist political system, with the  intent of understanding the legislatures' reciprocal interplay with the wider political system.   Results should point to new international cooperative research opportunities for future study  of the ways in which the institution of parliament(s) in Central Europe adapt(s) to the new  circumstances of democratization.    This workshop in political science fulfills the program objectives of advancing science by  enabling leading experts in the U. S. and Eastern Europe to combine complementary talents  and pool research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.",
