 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of an Undergraduate Aerospace Flight Systems                    Laboratory is proposed. Except for a personal computer for                      input/output functions, this laboratory will consist of a                       FRASCA International Undergraduate Flight Simulation System.                    This laboratory will provide hands-on studies of subjects in                    aircraft flight mechanics (performance, stability and control),                 simple stability augmentation systems (e.g., yaw damper), the                   dynamics of a complex aerospace system, and control systems.                    Because of the wide range of courses to which this facility is                  applicable, it will be integrated into the full ME                              undergraduate curriculum; from the first- or second- year                       course to the senior capstone design course. One of the most                    unique and intriguing uses of the facility will be the                          investigation of the flying qualities of project aircraft                       designed in the AAE senior design course.It should be noted                     that this simulator is very different from simulators used for                  pilot training. It is focused on being able to simulate a wide                  range of aircraft for the purpose of generating and collecting                  engineering \"flight-test\" data. With this capability, it                        becomes an engineering tool rather than a training facility. To                 assure that the facility is used so that maximum educational                    benefits are achieved, a Simulator Advisory Committee has been                  formed (with its members from the flight simulation profession)                 to participate in the development of the educational program.",
