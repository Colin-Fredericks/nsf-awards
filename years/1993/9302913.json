The project includes investigations of spin relaxation and                      transport at interfaces, high-Tc superconductivity, strong                      localization in both random and periodic structures. A new                      project undertaken in collaboration with a noted theorist from                  AT&T Bell Laboratories will address the area of two-                            dimensional electron gas and coupled quantum wells. The                         primary theme of the research is the study of transport of                      electrons and electromagnetic waves through solid state                         structures. The principal investigator has been unusually                       successful in carrying these fundamental studies further to                     technological areas (funded by other sources) leading to                        patent production and stimulation of small business activity.                   %%%                                                                             Non-Technical Abstract: This project uses microwave radiation                   to probe the properties of a wide range of materials, which                     include metals, high-Tc superconductors, and semiconductors.                    The research focuses on the electrical conductivity and                         response of these materials to microwaves. This fundamental                     research complements and enables technological projects in                      which the principal investigator is involved and which have                     lead to patents and techniques stimulating small businesses .",
