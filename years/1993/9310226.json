Project                                   funding will enable Dr. Temel Oguz of METU to                                   spend one year working at both MIT and WHOI; he                                 will work directly with Dr. David Aubrey (WHOI)                                 and Dr. Paola Rizzoli (MIT) on numerical                                        simulation of general circulation within the                                    Black Sea as well as the processes responsible                                  for eddy formation around the periphery of the                                  main basin.                                                                                                                                                     For many years, the Black Sea riparian countries                                have investigated the general circulation of the                                Black Sea.  Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union                                have been two of the lead countries performing                                  such modelling; more recently, highly qualified                                 Turkish scientists have joined this modelling                                   effort.  Previous models were limited by lack of                                computer power, affecting spatial and temporal                                  resolution, and completeness of the models.  This                               U.S.-Turkey cooperative research project will                                   implement state-of-the-art numerical models to                                  investigate the relative contributions of wind-                                 forcing and buoyancy fluxes in driving the                                      general Black Sea circulation.",
