 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recently there has been substantial research on mixture                    models based on a nonparametric mixing distribution, also called                semiparametric mixture models.   Applications have ranged from                  clinical trials, astronomy and marine biology.  Within                          statistics, research from semiparametric mixture models extends                 to empirical Bayes' estimation, measurement error models and                    random effects models, as well as other fields.  Insights into                  these questions and others have been greatly aided by work done                 by the principal speaker, Bruce Lindsay.  Professor Lindsay 's                  research on the geometry of mixture likelihoods has provided a                  unified approach for interpreting, solving and formulating models               of mixed distributions.   His intuitive approach and geometric                  insights make him an ideal lecturer for an NSF/CBMS conference on               the subject.                                                                         This project will support an NSF-CBMS Regional Research                    Conference in the Mathematical Sciences on Semiparametric Mixture               Methods: Theory and Methods - With Applications in Bayes,                       Measurment Error, and Random Effects Models to be held May 24 -                 28, 1993, on the campus of the University of South Carolina.                    Professor Bruce Lindsay of the Pennsylvania State University will               be the principal lecturer.                                                           To stimulate interest and activity in mathematical research,               the National Science Foundation each year supports a number of                  NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conferences in the Mathematical                      Sciences.  Each five-day conference features a distinguished                    lecturer who delivers ten lectures on a topic on important                      current research in one sharply focused area of the mathematical                sciences.  The lecturer subsequently prepares an expository                     monograph based upon these lectures, which is normally published                by the American Mathematical Society or the Society for                         Industrial and Applied Mathematics, or jointly by the American                  Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical                       Statistics.  Certain features differentiate these conferences                   from typical research conferences.  These are:  (1) Focus on a                  single important and timely area of research by a leading                       practitioner,  (2) Continued effect and local stimulation through               regional emphasis,  (3) Panel review for quality, breadth, and                  timeliness, and  (4) Published monographs for a wider audience.",
