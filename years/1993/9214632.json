This                                 university had initiated cross-disciplinary                                     research in a number of areas, single crystal                                   protein growth and designer drug research is one                                example.  However, they are also linking materials                              science and engineering, biomedical engineering,                                physics, chemistry, mathematics and computer and                                information science in research areas which focus                               on polymer synthesis and evaluation, molecular                                  biophysics and computational chemistry.                                              Many of their research efforts are getting                                 direct support from industrial participants and                                 this is allowing them to make their most valuable                               products, their students, keep in tune with the                                 needs of the industrial sector.  This renovation                                project encourages progress in one of the Nation's                              strategic research areas, materials science.",
