 "awd_abstract_narration": "An introductory physics laboratory has been equipped with 6                     high speed, networked IBM-compatible computers and appropriate                  software. The project is designed to increase student interest                  and to render physics more intuitive.  The idea is to remove                    some of the abstraction from the subject, and at the same time                  to replace pre-Newtonian concepts with more correct ones.  In                   addition, the equipment is being used, with appropriate                         simulation software, in lecture sessions to accomplish the same                 ends.  A third application of this equipment is to enhance the                  natural science CORE lectures and to provide a lab exercise                     that is more stimulating and motivating, in part through the                    use of up-to-date technology.  Present-day students do not have                 sufficient background to pursue physics, because they have not                  internalized basic mathematics and have not been challenged to                  solve problems by thinking, but only by parroting what they                     have been drilled in.  This laboratory is intended to evoke                     understanding and insight through discovery, which has been the                 missing element in present day pre-college education.",
