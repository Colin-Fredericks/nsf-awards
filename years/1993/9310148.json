 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will continue an ongoing effort to precisely                 measure large-scale solar surface brightness variations across the              solar disk.  A unique and specialized instrument to make these                  measurements has been constructed at Big Bear Solar Observatory,                and preliminary data have been acquired.  With a timeseries of                  precision photometric data, the PI will conduct a number of                     investigations: 1)  The PI will compare measured latitude- and                  time-dependent brightness variations with time-dependent solar                  constant measurements.  The more complete spatial information                   gotten from the photometer will be used to better understand the                physical mechanisms responsible for short- and long-term solar                  luminosity variations.  For example, measured average latitude- and             \u001a-dependent brightness structure (here \u001a is the usual heliocentric              angle), together with the measured facular contrast function, can               be used to directly measure the contribution of faculae to solar                luminosity changes.  Further, if the Sun's luminosity variations                are determined (using our photometric data) to be confined to the               active latitudes, then precision ground-based measurements such as              those proposed here could make an excellent substitute for space-               based solar constant measurements, when the latter are unavailable.             2)  The PI will make a better measurement of the pole-equator                   temperature difference, making some effort to separate the cycle-               dependent magnetic signals from the presumably time-independent)                differential rotation signal.  Such a measurement will constrain                models of the Sun's differential rotation.  3)  The PI will                     accurately measure brightness variations near the solar pole, in                order to get a better understanding of the polar magnetic fields                and polar faculae.                                                                   Making precision measurements of the large-scale brightness                structure of the Sun is to date a largely unexplored area of                    research.  The data set of measurements could contribute                        significantly to the understanding and monitoring of the Sun's                  luminosity variations.                                                          #",
