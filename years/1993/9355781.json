The approach of using a relatively small amount of federal dollars as leverage to move the states toward developing and implementing coordinated reform efforts has received national attention.  There is a great deal of interest in the progress of the SSI program among policy experts, education reformers, and the US Department of Education.   The project is a conference for a small group of policy experts, Statewide Systemic Initiatives (SSI) Principal Investigators, NSF program officers, and contractors to reflect, analyze, and synthesize from the collective experience and wisdom of all who are intimately involved in the SSI.  At the end of the conference, a monograph will be produced on what has been learned about statewide systemic change and the implications of that knowledge for the role of the federal, state, and local governments, among others, in supporting systemic change.  The conference will be held at the Wingspread Conference Center in Racine, Wisconsin.  The proposers, Dr. Iris Weiss, Horizon Research, Inc., Dr. Mark St. John of Inverness Research Associates, and Dr. Joy Frechtling of Westat, Inc., are highly qualified to conduct this grant.  Cost sharing in the amount of $30,171 is included. ***",
