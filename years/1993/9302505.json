 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research of Professor Savage to work               in combinatorics.  One of the fundamental problems in the area of               combinatorial algorithms is that of efficiently generating items                in a particular class in such a way that each item is generated                 exactly once.  Asymptotic improvement in the efficiency of                      combinatorial generation requires not only good data structures                 and algorithm design techniques, but more often, some new insight               into the structure of the combinatorial class involved.  These                  structure questions are in the realm of well-known open problems                in discrete mathematics, graph theory, group theory, and                        combinatorics.  It is these type of problems that Professor                     Savage will address.                                                                 The research is in the general area of combinatorics.                      Combinatorics attempts to find efficient methods to study how                   discrete collections can be organized.  The behavior of discrete                systems is extremely important to modern communications.  For                   example, the design of large networks, as in telephone systems,                 and the design of algorithms in computer science all deal with                  discrete objects, and this makes use of combinatorial research.",
