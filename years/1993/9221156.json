 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221156  Witt      Semiconductor bulk crystal growth suffers from a gap between  theory and experiment which is to a large extent  attributable to the non-availability of quantifiable thermal  boundary conditions. With focus on this deficiency it is  proposed to design, construct, characterize and test a heat-  pipe-based heat transfer control system for semiconductor  crystal growth by the Czochralski technique.  The system  will involve a three part heat pipe assembly with sodium as  heat transfer fluid.  The establishment of controllable and  quantifiable axi-symmetric thermal boundary conditions is to  be ascertained through temperature measurements with a  thermocouple array and on the basis of thermal imaging.  Its  functionality is to be tested in growth of Ga doped  germanium at crystal diameters of up to 2 cm. The  relationship between the prevailing boundary conditions and  the crystal growth behavior is to be determined through  quantitative segregation analyses.  These analyses are made  possible with the introduction during growth of current  controlled crystal melt interface demarcation (revealed by  etching and phase contrast microscopy on axial crystal  samples) and quantitative composition determination based on  spreading resistance measurements.  %%%  Semiconductor crystal growth, the basis for solid state  device technology, is conducted on a largely empirical basis  and the resulting materials fall short of theoretical  performance limits. The proposed research is expected to  contribute to narrowing the gap between theory and  experiment.  It will provide a means for increased control  over growth related defect formation in semiconductors and  is expected to establish a basis for more effective use of  mathematical modeling to achieve specific growth control  objectives.  ***",
