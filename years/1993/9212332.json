 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fact that the United States has been surprised by the force of              nationalism in destroying countries such as the Soviet Union and                Yugoslavia shows that our assumptions and theories  about                       nationalism and ethnicism have serious flaws.  The countries of the             former Soviet Union remain ethnically very divided and the                      conseqences of these divisions are only recently being appreciated.                                                                                             In this research investigation, a leading comparative politics area             specialist and a leading theorist on nationalism are jointly                    examining the most complex and least understood of the ethnic                   issues - - language use and assimilation - - in six of the new                  countries of the former Soviet Union.  Using both sociological and              anthropological methods, the investigation not only aims at                     contributing to our understanding of this crucial area of the                   world, but also to the improvement of our theories of language use              and assimilation and the general factors that determine whether                 language politics does or does not lead to conflict.  Given the                 total lack of correspondence between country boundaries and ethnic              boundaries in the Third World, this is a central question for our               understanding of politics and democratization in the former Soviet              Union.",
