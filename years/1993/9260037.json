 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to support research on development of a flue gas               monitoring system for determination of the potential air                        contaminants in emissions of gases from combustion processes.                   The system is based on the application of principles derived from               use of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy in monitoring                    nitrogen, sulfur and chlorine in an on-line, diagnostic                         instrument that can be used for determination of the quality of                 effluent gas streams.                                                                                                                                           Exhaust gases from combustion of fossil fuels and from combustion               of solid wastes results in the production of byproduct gases that               pollute air into which they are discharged.  Results of this                    project are expected to determine the feasibility of producing an               instrument that could be used to monitor nitrogen and sulfur                    oxides and air toxics such as hydrogen chloride in exhaust gases                from combustion processes.  The proposal leading to this award                  was submitted in response to NSF 92-30, Small Business Innovation               Research under Topic No. 25d, Environmental Systems.",
