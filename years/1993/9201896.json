 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a continuation of a study of the cycling and                    diagenesis of organic matter at the sea floor.  Knowledge of the                deposition flux, cycling rate and burial rate of biogenic elements              in sediments is required to assess the influence of ocean processes             on global climate and to properly interpret the sedimentary record.             Recent results from this project have raised questions about the                dissolution of CaCO3 from sea floor sediments as a result of CO2                metabolically released in the pore water.  Models of the alkalinity             change in benthic flux chambers predict an alkalinity flux from the             sediments, but the chamber data show little if any alkalinity flux              during sea floor deployments.  The goals of the present research                are 1.  To determine the influence of metabolically released CO2 on             the dissolution of CaCO3 in deep sea sediments; 2. To determine the             kinetic expression that accurately represents CaCO3 dissolution on              the dea floor.  The first part of the project consists of a short               cruise to the continental slope off North Carolina to test a new                High Pressure Sediment Sampler and some alterations to the benthic              chambers by the P.I.   The project is being coordinated with work               on the same topic by Sayles and Martin (using a wire-line in situ               whole core squeezer) and by Reimers (using PCO2 microelectrodes.                The short test cruise provides an opportunity to test all the                   equipment and in addition may provide date on carbonate dissolution             in an area where flux of organic carbon to the sea floor is                     predicted to be high, but bottom waters are saturated with CaCO3.               The major portion of the work will be focussed on the Ceara Rise-               guiana Basin region where the presence of Antarctic Bottom Water                undersaturated with CaCO3 should cause significant measurable                   dissolution.  The sea floor fluxes of carbonate system parameters               measured by the in situ benthic flux chambers (this project) will               be compared to the results from the other techniques.",
