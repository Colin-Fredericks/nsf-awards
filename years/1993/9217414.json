 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimal routing is essential for efficient operations of                   computer networks over a large geographical area.  If there is a                sudden large disturbance to the network, severe congestion can                  occur, and as a result, the best existing optimal routing algorithm             may take a large number of iterations to steer the routing to a                 reasonable delay level.  The aggregation based gradient projection              algorithm studied in this project has demonstrated speed-up ratios              over the existing best routing algorithm ranging from infinity to               3300% - 700%.  This kind of speed-up result is worthy of further                investigation for possible eventual implementation in large real                networks.  The idea of exploiting hierarchical aggregation and                  disaggregation-decomposition (HAD) is the cornerstone of the                    project.  Fast computation usually comes from imitating how nature              solves its own difficult computation problems.. For example,                    several lines of anatomical and physiological evidence suggest that             information processing in the cortex is fundamentally hierarchical              in nature.  Intimately related to the concept of hierarchy are the              concepts of good organization, aggregation (or summarized                       computation, an almost necessary mechanism for solving large                    problems) disaggregation (for accurate solution, details are                    needed), and decomposition (the classical idea of                               divide-and-conquer).  The HAD algorithm is the result of                        integrating the related concepts into a generic computational                   system.  The project aims to develop the HAD based algorithms                   for both conventional packet switching and ATM networks, to                     simulate the developed algorithms in a realistic network                        environment and to exploit the speed advantage to the fullest                   extent, and to establish the theoretical speed-up complexity for                the HAD algorithm.  This project is a joint project with G. M.                  Huang of Texas A&M University.",
