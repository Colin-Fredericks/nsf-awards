The purpose of the                              conference is to report on some of the latest                                   developments in the areas of classical and applied analysis                     that relate to signal processing and wavelets.  This                            combination of topics brings together expertise from many                       countries, especially some mathematicians with contacts                         and ties with Middle East. This proposal supports the                           participation of approximately 15 U.S. mathematicians.                          Conference participants will present papers that will be                        compiled and published as a conference volume.                                                                                                                  This conference in mathematical sciences fulfills the                           program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by                          enabling leading experts in the United States, Egypt and                        elsewhere to combine complementary talents and present                          research results in areas of strong mutual interest and                         competence.  This conference has the potential for                              generating new scientific activity and new international                        linkages.",
