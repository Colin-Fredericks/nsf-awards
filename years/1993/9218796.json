 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition from exponential to stationary phase growth in                   bacteria heralds extensive changes in biochemical, macromolecular,              morphological and physiological properties.  Stationary phase                   conditions in the laboratory may accurately reflect predominant                 conditions in the environment, where the unique properties of                   stationary phase cells are probably critical for competition and                survival.  Current evidence suggests that alterations in the                    pattern of gene expression, mediated via the effects of a few                   global regulatory factors, program these extensive changes.                     Glycogen (a-1,4 glucan with a-1,6 branches) biosynthesis is                     transcriptionally activated during early stationary phase in                    Escherichia coli.  Our recent analysis of glycogen-overproducing                mutants indicates that a previously uncharacterized regulatory                  system controls glycogen synthesis.  This project is testing the                hypothesis that the pleiotropic transposon-insertion mutation, TR1-             5, disrupts a component of a novel global regulatory system.  The               mutated gene is being sequenced and the mechanism of its effects on             the expression of glycogen biosynthesis genes (glg) and other E.                coli genes will be studied to elucidate its potential role in                   stationary phase adaptation.  Although a-1,4 glucans are the                    predominant biological storage compounds and are important                      industrial products, the biological function of bacterial glycogen              has not been rigorously established.  Therefore, this project will              also address the biological function of glycogen using survival and             recovery experiments conducted with isogenic glycogen mutants.                  %%%                                                                             This research is expected to provide information useful in                      achieving maximum gene expression in bacteria growing in industrial             fermentors.",
