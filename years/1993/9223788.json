This research is concerned with the design of storage systems that  can hide the latency associated with accessing high-capacity  distributed storage and hence support guaranteed latency and  throughput.  The main objectives of the project are to (1) define  new storage system interfaces that allow quality-of-service and  synchronization requirements to be passed to the storage system;  (2) define a storage system architecture that can use this  information to hide storage access latency; and (3) implement a  prototype latency-hiding storage system.  The principle method  underlying the latency-hiding storage system is prefetching, which  is based on information gathered from applications through the  storage system interfaces described above.  A storage system with  these characteristics will significantly reduce the burden on  programmers of multimedia applications, particularly those based on  stored audio and video, and will help to facilitate the development  of multimedia computing in large-scale systems.   ***",
