 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increases in middle ultraviolet radiation associated with the                   Antarctic ozone hole have been shown to inhibit the                             photosynthesis of phytoplankton, and results have been                          extrapolated to estimate the effect of ozone depletion on primary               productivity in the marginal ice zone.   This research will                     refine the assessment by specifying detailed wavelength-dependent               biological weighting functions for the inhibition of                            photosynthesis by ultraviolet radiation, and by considering the                 mitigating effects of vertical mixing.  Biological weighting                    functions of phytoplankton in the marginal ice zone will be                     measured under controlled conditions and applied in a new model                 of photosynthesis to predict primary productivity in situ, as                   well as under altered ultraviolet irradiance.  These predictions                will be compared with observations on samples from the water                    column and with measurements during incubations of several hours                under different irradiance regimes.  Results of these comparisons               will be used to test the model and to quantify the potential                    artifact of long incubations.  Assumptions about the kinetics of                photoinhibition and recovery, critical to modeling the effects of               vertical mixing, will be examined with time-course experiments.                 Results will be incorporated into a model of photosynthesis and                 photoinhibition in the water column that will be used to predict                the influence of ozone depletion on marine primary production,                  particularly in the marginal zone.",
