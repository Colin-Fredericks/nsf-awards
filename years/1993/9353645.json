AAA aims to increase  student participation in the math and sciences by increasing the level of expectation for all  students, while simultaneously redefining the teaching and learning equation in elementary,  middle, and high school classrooms.  Included in the redefinition of math and science are:  interdisciplinary planning teams, the Socratic seminar, cooperative learning, Hawaii Algebra and  hawaii Geometry, science/technology exhibitions, and the implementation of authentic student  assessment processes.  Strong emphasis has been placed on incorporating reading and writing  to learn strategies in mathematics and science classrooms at all grade levels.  Implementation  of the many classroom innovations will be facilitated by the project's three full-time lead  teachers.    Beyond the reform of teaching and learning at the classroom level, a number of intervention  programs have been selected to enhance minority student performance and attitudes as well as  parental participation.  These include student visits to regional university campuses, Family Math  and Family Science, SAT/PSAT preparation courses, SECME programs, and science camps.   Project monitoring and evaluation will be facilitated through the implementation of Hall  and  Hord's Concerns-Based Adoption Model and the use of numerous traditional and alternative  modes of student and teacher assessment.",
