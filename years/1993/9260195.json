 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I SBIR project studies the use of                                    damping elements for earthquake resistance of                                   flexible frame buildings.  A new type of passive                                damping mechanism is studied that is potentially                                superior to conventional damping mechanisms:  a                                 resonant viscous damper, or RVD.  The RVD will                                  be placed in the same locations as conventional                                 earthquake dampers, but because it will possess an                              internal resonance tuned to a building's                                        fundamental resonant frequency.  As a result, it will                           offer much higher levels of passive damping.                                                                                                                    The objective of this project is to develop a                                   practical, reliable, and economical damping device                              that can be applied to a broad range of medium-                                 sized buildings.  The Phase I goal is to validate the                           RVD concept by both analysis and testing of an                                  engineering model.  Current earthquake dampers                                  are designed to provide 20-30% structural damping.                              If successful, the RVD will provide over twice this                             damping in the primary mode of a building without                               any large increases in frame stiffness nor any large                            added masses.  The RVD will also reduce motion                                  due to wind sway.  An RVD will offer designers in                               any field of structural dynamics (civil, aerospace,                             mechanical) an attractive alternative solution to                               many vibration suppression problems.",
