 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research continues on the development of efficient  algorithms  for computational problems arising in several application areas,  including Optimization, Artificial Intelligence, Logic Databases,  Distributed  Decision-Making, Testing, Parallel Computation, and  Mathematical Economics, as  well as on the foundations of  Complexity Theory.   This project focuses on: (1) the  approximability of several optimization problems, in the light of recent  important advances in this area; (2)  work on the competitive analysis  of on-line algorithms  along three lines, using competitive analysis as a  yardstick for  measuring the performance of distributed decision-making  algorithms, as well as the value of information and  communication; applying the  methodology to problems motivated by  parallel compilers; and trying to resolve  the K-server  conjecture; (3) work on several problems related to the  efficient  implementation of logic database queries, as well as in further  developing a computational theory of rapid informal reasoning  based on model  selection; (4) the study of certain complexity classes that appear to lie  strictly between P and NP, capturing limited non determinism and  total  functions; (5) the use of computational complexity as a `scientific  metaphor` for capturing bounded rationality in Mathematical  Economics; looking  from the algorithmic point of view at some key problems in the Theory of Games  and that of Implementation; and (6) work on some interesting computational  problems related  to testing large distributed systems.",
