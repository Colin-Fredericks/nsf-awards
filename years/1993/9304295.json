 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304295  Lukas  This is a planning grant for research in concurrent software  systems. It addresses the specification phase with a formal  specification language family that utilizes the object as the  basic model. The long-term objective of the research is to define  a hierarchy of formal specification languages that address, in  increasing specificity, the requirements of concurrent systems.  This family of languages is based on the concept of a base  language that serves as the parent class and subclasses that  represent increasingly specific features of concurrent systems.  The preliminary approach is to first develop a hierarchical  description of the classes and their relationships and then to  formally define the base class, both syntactically and  semantically. Using inheritance, subclasses will then be defined  for categories of programming languages that support specific  language features. This approach to the specification of  concurrent object-oriented systems promotes the use of  abstraction and assists the specifier with the transformation of  a problem to a language-specific form. The hierarchy of  specifications also has potential for specification reuse.    The  planing activities include comprehensive study of research  in  areas  that  are  fundamental  to  the  proposed  research,  including  formal  specification languages, concurrent  object  oriented  languages, and algebraic specifications. The planning  activities  also include the development of a mini-language  to  provide  a  mechanism for experimentation and for expansion  of  the proposed research.  ***",
