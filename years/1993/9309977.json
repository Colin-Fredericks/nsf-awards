 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309977  McCormick    The diverse and very large vertebrate group of bony fishes have an  inner ear used for hearing.  Behavioral studies show that species  have different capabilities for hearing underwater sound, sometimes  correlated with peripheral structural specializations such as an  acoustic connection from the swimbladder.  Recent work in  neuroanatomy has shown that there also are specializations in the  cellular populations, called nuclei, in auditory centers in the  brains of some fish species that hear very well; brains of some  fish considered to have more primitive auditory systems lack these  specializations.  This project uses neuroanatomical techniques to  trace the pathways of nerve fibers from the individual inner ear  sensory organs to these central nuclei, and to clarify the detailed  structure of these nuclei, in species chosen to represent  particular generalized versus specialized features of anatomy or  behavior.  The results will determine how the central nervous  system components for hearing are organized differently between  specialists and generalists.  This work provides important  groundwork influencing future physiological, behavioral, and  theoretical work on hearing in fish and on underwater sound  reception.  It has educational impact in strongly involving  undergraduate students directly in research.  In addition, it will  have impact on studies of biodiversity by directly addressing the  variation of vertebrate hearing mechanisms, and on studies of  evolution of hearing in the vertebrates.  ***",
