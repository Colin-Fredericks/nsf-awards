 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports mathematical research in the area of                   partial differential equations.  The work concerns boundary value               problems in domains with relatively coarse boundaries, that is                  boundaries on which discontinuities in the derivative are allowed               such as those with corners.  Both elliptic and parabolic                        equations will be treated.  Although considerable work has been                 done in the area in the past few years, little attention has been               given to mixed boundary value problems.  In particular attention                will be given to the question of regularity: if the                             boundary components are known to be integrable of a certain order               then one would like to establish the best power integral of the                 gradient. A second line of work focuses on spectral properties of               elliptic operators.  Here the problem is that of locating                       spectral resonances in domains which consists of a cavity joined                to an unbounded exterior domain by a thin tube.  The point of                   this type of investigation is to quantify the extent to which the               operator may be modelled by separate elliptic operators on the                  individual parts.  Finally, work will continue on questions                     involving inverse boundary value problems.  In its more practical               setting, one wants to know the extent to which quantities such as               charge on the surface of a body uniquely determines current                     across the surface.  The goal of this work is to look at cases                  where the underlying differential operator may have nonsmooth                   coefficients.                                                                        Partial differential equations form a basis for                            mathematical modeling of the physical world.  The role of                       mathematical analysis is not so much to create the equations as                 it is to provide qualitative and quantitative information about                 the solutions.  This may include answers to questions about                     uniqueness, smoothness and growth.  In addition, analysis                       often develops methods for approximation of solutions and                       estimates on the accuracy of these approximations.",
