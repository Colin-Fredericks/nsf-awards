The students will work with the principal  investigator on selected questions in applied mathematics taken  from industry-related problems.  Typical of these questions are  studies of light loss in space telescope metering, modeling  clocks in space and analyzing relativistic effects of lights  paths.  Some of the work will involve numerical approximations.   Visits to industrial research facilities are also planned.       Research experiences for undergraduates provides first-hand  applications of mathematical theory developed during students'  classroom experience.  The work often leads to publishable  results which are presented at professional meetings.  Students  are also better prepared to make important career choices when  they return to the final years of undergraduate study.  ***",
