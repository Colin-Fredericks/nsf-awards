 "awd_abstract_narration": "A collection of problems in stochastic adaptive control will               be investigated in this project. Stochastic adaptive control is                 the optimal ergodic control of an unknown system and includes                   identification and control. For finite dimensional, continuous                  time, unknown linear stochastic systems the research will improve               existing results for completely observed systems and result in a                better conceptual understanding of partially observed systems.                  For unknown stochastic linear distributed parameter systems the                 initial work on adaptive control of systems described by analytic               semigroups with boundary or point control will be expanded to                   stochastic hyperbolic systems. For unknown, finite dimensional                  nonlinear stochastic systems the results for almost self-                       optimality and self-optimality will be improved. The adaptive                   control of unknown stochastic distributed parameter systems will                be initiated for families of semilinear equations with                          cylindrical noise.                                                                   Most physical systems require the intervention of control                  mechanisms for their optimal performance. Typically the system is               not completely known and often contains random and unknown                      perturbations. The control of an unknown system subject to                      unknown random perturbations is called stochastic adaptive                      control. Most controlled systems require stochastic adaptive                    control in order to meet system performance criteria. This                      project will investigate problems in stochastic adaptive control                that are motivated by potential applications to physical systems.               It is anticipated that significant improvements in the conceptual               understanding of adaptive stochastic control processes and their                applications will be obtained .",
