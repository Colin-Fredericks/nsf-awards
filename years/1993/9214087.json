 "awd_abstract_narration": "9214087  Perger  This award supports Professor Warren F. Perger of  Michigan Technological University for collaborative  research in physics with Professor Dirk Trautmann of  the Institute of Theoretical Physics of the University  of Basel, Switzerland.  The objective of their joint  research is to accurately calculate the relativistic  ionization form factor.  Their research plan  effectively exploits their complementary expertise.   They will work with data produced by the experimental  group at Basel, testing a computer program developed  by Professor Trautmann, and using atomic continuum  wave functions generated by a program written by  Professor Beers.  This will give Professor Beers  valuable experience in applying his computational  expertise to a realistic atomic physics problem.    The nature of relativistic effects on ionization  cross-sections is not well understood.  Detailed  knowledge of the ionization cross section, which can  be obtained from the ionization form factor, is of  great importance in many applications of atomic  collision theory to plasma physics and in studies of  the physics of stellar atmospheres.   ***",
