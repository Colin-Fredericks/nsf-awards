 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine phytoplankton produce a variety of organic osmolytes                     including the nitrogenous compound glycine betaine (GBT) and                    its sulfur analog, dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP).  It                       appears that GBT and DMSP make large and hitherto                               unrecognized contributions to the cellular nitrogen and                         sulfur pools in many species of marine phytoplankton and to                     particulate organic nitrogen (PON) and particulate organic                      sulfur (POS) pools in surface sea water.  Very little is                        known about the production, distribution and cycling of                         these labile biogenic compounds. Information from the                           literature and from preliminary studies suggests that many                      species of phytoplankton produce both GBT and DMSP                              simultaneously and that nitrogen availability may affect the                    relative proportions of GBT and DMSP.  This project will                        conduct laboratory and field studies to test the following                      hypotheses:  1) GBT makes up a significant (5-20%) fraction                     of cellular nitrogen in certain species of marine                               phytoplankton and DMSP is a major constituent of cellular                       sulfur; 2) There is a relationship between taxonomy and GBT                     and DMSP production; 3) The levels of GBT and GMSP in                           phytoplankton are a function of nitrogen availability, with                     DMSP favored under N-limitation; 4) Phytoplankton take up                       GBT and DMSP from their surroundings and release them under                     certain conditions; 5) Production of GBT over DMSP, or                          selection of species which produce GBT, will be favored in                      high nitrogen environments.  This study will provide new and                    important data on the quantitative role of methylated                           nitrogen and sulfur osmolytes to the cellular nitrogen and                      sulfur budgets of phytoplankton and to PON and POS in the                       sea.  This information will lead to a better understanding                      of the biological cycling of nitrogen and sulfur in the                         ocean.",
