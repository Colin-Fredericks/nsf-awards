 "awd_abstract_narration": "Unique perfluoro-organic/inorganic oxide hybrid materials will be               formulated by merging processes recently developed for the solution             and melt processing of perfluorosulfonate ionomers (PFSI's) and the             production of nanocomposites by the in situ sol-gel reaction for                silicon and metal alkoxides within the polar clusters of PFSI's.                The working hypothesis is that the resultant morphology of the                  inorganic phase is ordered by the nanophase-separated morphology of             the PFSI matrix.  In this research, the three-dimensional                       morphological template presented by the PFSI will be tailored by                manipulating the primary polymer structure, polymer solution                    conditions, film casting procedure, and post-processing (e.g.                   drying, annealing, melt-quenching, mechanical orientation).  The                nanocomposites will be extensively characterized for microstructure             broadly ranging from light microscopic resolution down to the level             of Angstroms using various microscopic, scattering, diffraction,                and spectroscopic methods.  Structure-property relationships will               result from the investigation of the mechanical, thermal,                       dielectric/electrical conductance and gas permeation                            characteristics of these materials.  The percolative nature of the              inorganic phase is anticipated to generate \"smart\" materials in the             sense of acting as temperature and pressure sensors.  Oriented                  nanocomposites should possess directional mechanical, thermal, and              electrical properties.  The scope of the microstructural                        investigation will be greatly broadened through strong interactions             with governmental (Sandia, Oak Ridge) and industrial (Dow Chemical              Co.) laboratories.                                                                                                                                              This research aims to produce new materials that should be act as               gas-permselective membranes under rather demanding conditions, and              this be useful in a variety of separations.  This research is in                cooperation with the Electric Power Research Institute.",
