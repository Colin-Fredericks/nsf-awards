 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large butterfly family Nymphalidae has been fundamentally                   important to diverse research fields in biology for more than a                 century.  However, efforts to elucidate the group's evolutionary                history using data from morphology have met with frustration; the               consensus of available morphological phylogenies yields an almost               total lack of resolution.  This project will examine cladistic                  relationships in the Nymphalidae through character analysis of                  DNA sequences taken from independent mitochondrial and nuclear                  gene regions.  The survey of taxa will include representatives of               all nymphalid tribes (in 72 genera).  This, combined with the use               of multiple genetic markers, is expected to provide resolution                  not available from previous morphological or molecular studies.                 The phylogenetic results will serve as a framework for examining                well-known evolutionary hypotheses including mimicry, herbivore-                hostplant coevolution, and the evolution of unpalatability.                     %%%                                                                             The butterfly family Nymphalidae contains some of the best-known                species in the insect world, including the Monarch Butterfly, our               national insect, and such conspicuous members of the tropical                   fauna as the Passion Flower butterflies (Heliconius) and the                    beautiful Morpho butterflies.  Forms such as the Morpho are                     currently the focus of intense conservation research as part of                 urgent efforts to save the earth's biodiversity.  This project                  will sequence DNA molecules from representative butterfly species               in the family Nymphalidae and use the molecular data obtained to                produce a phylogeny or description of relationships among those                 species.  This phylogeny will then allow researchers to address                 other questions or theories about such things as mimicry and                    hostplant associations of these insects.",
