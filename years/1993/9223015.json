 "awd_abstract_narration": "The measurement of people's values for public or non-marketed                   goods - or for the loss of these goods - is playing an increasing               role in benefit-cost analysis for public policy decisions and                   regulations and in assessment of liability for environmental                    damage.  A widely used measure of these values, judgment of                     willingness to pay (WTP) for public goods, seems to be                          susceptible to a number of biases and irrelevant influences,                    particularly when it is elicited by a survey instrument.  An                    example is the embedding effect, in which the valuation of a good               such as disaster preparedness depends on whether the entire                     program containing that good (environmental services) has been                  evaluated first.  The research will conduct questionnaire studies               designed to isolate crucial features of WTP with particular                     attention to the role of moral norms.  Alternative elicitation                  methods, such as direct ratings of goods, will be explored, with                a view to understanding how unbiased evaluation might be                        achieved.  Other variables for investigation will include                       provision of context, type of choice rule, type of good                         (environmental or consumer), number of other people affected,                   fairness of the payment vehicle, and expectation of others'                     responses.",
