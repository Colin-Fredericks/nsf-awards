We will analyze these recent flows for 3He and                      21Ne to establish the production rate beyond 14C chronology.                    We will also measure 21Ne production rates in quartz and                        feldspar from Holocene and late Pleistocene flows.  In                          addition we will measure the 21Ne contents of co-existing                       minerals to establish the compositional dependency of 21Ne                      production.                                                                          In addition , we will begin a concentrated effort on                       determining the mountain deglaciation at the end of the                         Wisconsin of two regions:  the western United States and                        Canada, and the southern Andes.  We will concentrated on                        volcanic terrains because 3He and 21Ne is quantitatively                        retained in volcanic pyroxene and olivine; plutonic terrains                    will be analyzed after we establish the 21Ne production rate                    in quartz and can separate it from nucleogenic 21Ne                             production in old (>20 Ma) plutonic rocks.  Western North                       America and the southern Andes will be studied because it is                    in those two regions that we have established the production                    rate of 3He and 21Ne (North America), and will extend it                        back in time (South America).  Such constrasting studies                        will help to establish the Northern and Southern Hemisphere                     ice sheets were retreating at the same time or not and if                       the younger Dryas is to be found in western North and South                     America.",
