 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will be carrying out research projects on                 several basic problems in topology and geometry of high and low                 dimensional manifolds and of stratified spaces and on topological               and algebraic-geometric invariants of varieties.  One set of                    problems to be studied concerns the role, calculation, and                      relationships among fundamental invariants of varieties and                     stratified spaces, such as the characteristic classes.  Another                 group of problems concerns the classification of fixed points of                transformation groups and their relationships to these basic                    invariants.  Still a third set of projects to be investigated                   concerns deep new invariants of three-dimensional manifolds and                 their relationship to the representation theory of the fundamental              group.  This work will entail a study of relevant analytical                    problems concerning spectral flow and symplectic geometrical                    questions concerning the Maslow index.                                               The details of these parts vary, but all are concerned with                reducing geometric information to a subject for calculation.  The               nature of the geometric information involved is the crux of the                 difficulty.  While questions about lengths, areas, angles, volumes,             and so forth virtually cry out to be reduced to calculations, it is             far different with what are known as topological properties of                  geometric objects.  These are properties such as connectedness                  (being all in one piece), knottedness, having no holes, and so                  forth.  All systematic study of such properties, for example, how               to tell whether two geometric objects really differ in respect to               one of these properties or are only superficially different, or how             to classify the variety of differences that can occur, all these                have only truly been comprehended and mastered when they have been              reduced to matters of calculation.",
