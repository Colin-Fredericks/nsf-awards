Professor Haifan Xiang is Vice Dean of the College of                           Structural Engineering, and Director of the Institute of                        Bridge Design and Research at Tongjie University, Shanghai,                     China.  He has been a faculty member of Tongjie since 1958,                     rising through various academic ranks to a Ph.D. Supervisory                    Professor, the highest distinction conferred by the Chinese                     Ministry of Education.  He was awarded the Certificate of                       State Expert in Bridge Engineering in 1986.  He is an                           Executive Deputy Director of the Chinese National Laboratory                    for Natural Disaster Prevention, Vice President of the                          Chinese Wind Engineering Society, a Director on the                             Executive Board of the Chinese Society of Civil Engineers,                      and General Secretary of the Institute of Bridge and                            Structural Engineering of Chinese Society of Civil                              Engineers.  He led the research team at Tongjie that                            investigated the wind resistance for nearly all the recently                    constructed long-span bridges in China, including Nanpu                         Cable-Stayed Bridge, Yanpu Cable-Stayed Bridge, Wuhan                           Yangtze River Bridge, Jiangyin Yangtze River Bridge, Shantou                    Bay Bridge, and Jiujiang Yangtze River Bridge.  He is                           currently a consultant for the designs of three suspension                      bridges and five cable-stayed bridges in China.
