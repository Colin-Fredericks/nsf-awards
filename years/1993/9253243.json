 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Supercomputing Teacher Enhancement Project (STEP) trains                    forty-six teachers in the San Diego area over a period of 42                    months. Six of the teachers are lead teachers who receive                       extensive training at the Lawrence Livermore Labs prior to the                  start of the project and at university expense.  They serve as                  teaching assistants working with the forty participating                        teachers over the following three years.  The participating                     teachers learn the basics of computational  science,                            programming, and high performance computing then are expected                   to share and work with approximately ten other teachers in                      their schools.  They learn to use computing at many levels, to                  incorporate computational science into their curriculum, and                    to develop activities or projects for students.  The teacher                    training consists of three week summer workshops, academic                      year meetings, and visits to local facilities.                                                                                                                  Through the combined efforts of the universities, the local                     school districts, the super computing center, and the                           community, the project will directly impact students in urban                   and similar schools in the San Diego area with a high number                    of minority students.  The project targets underrepresented                     teacher and teachers of students who are traditionally                          underrepresented.",
