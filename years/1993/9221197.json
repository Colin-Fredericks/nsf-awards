 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this work is to prepare and characterize non-oxidic                 glasses, based on sulfides, selenides, tellurides, and phosphides               of the Main Group III, IV and V elements.  New synthetic routes for             these systems are developed to exert and maintain tighter                       structural and compositional control of these glasses than                      presently possible by melt-quenching techniques.  These routes                  involve precipitation from solution using well-defined molecular                precursors, and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)               of amorphous films from gaseous reactants.  The structures of these             materials are characterized by state-of-art solid-state NMR                     methods.  An integral part of this project is the development of                new heteronuclear X-Y double resonance NMR methodology, and its                 application to the system under study.  In addition, detailed in-               situ high-temperature NMR measurements provide information about                structure, dynamics, and chemical equilibria of these materials in              the molten state above glass transition temperature.                            %%%                                                                             The goal of this work is to prepare and characterize new glasses                that have important technological significance as low-frequency                 waveguides, photoconductors, and solid electrolytes.  While the                 latter two applications already are being commercially utilized,                potential uses of infrared fibers include laser power delivery,                 remote tempearture monitoring, thermal imaging, and chemical                    sensing.  The project aims at developing more versatile preparation             strategies that maintain closer structural and compositional                    control of these glasses through synthesis than presently possible.             In addition, a fundamental understanding of the physical properties             of these glasses in terms of their structural organization is                   sought.  Innovative spectroscopic techniques are used to uncover                the atomic arrangements in the proposed glasses.  By virtue of this             approach, the project is instrumental in developing and testing                 fundamental theoretical concepts for the structural description of              amorphous and glassy covalent solids.  The combination of new                   preparation methods and structural analysis will aid in the                     development of glasses with improved technological properties.",
