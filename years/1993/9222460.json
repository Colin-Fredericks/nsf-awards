Simultaneous traverses through convective clouds by two                  similarly equipped King Airs are the focus of the proposed work.                Emphasis will be on the evolution of the kinematic fields within                those cumuli that were sampled with more than a dozen passes during             their life cycle.  The two-aircraft pattern will provide                        observations of the basic characteristics of the near-environment,              visible cloud, updraft and downdraft, and the horizontal flow in                and at the edges of these features.  Vertical mass flux and                     momentum transport as a function of life cycle will be estimated                for several of the better observed cases.  The analyses have the                potential to be the bench-mark for the kinematic structure of moist             convection in an environment characterized by low shear and high                convective available potential energy.",
