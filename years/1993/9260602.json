 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many applications in materials research and production require                  accurate, non-contact surface temperature measurements on various               materials under a variety of conditions.  All such surfaces emit                radiation, which may be used as a measure of their surface                      temperature, providing the surface's emissivity is known.                       Unfortunately, emissivity values are usually uncertain, which leads             to errors in conventional pyrometry.  This proposal concerns a new              active pyrometer method, wherein the ratio of target reflectances               at two separate wavelengths is measured together with the target                radiances at these same wavelengths.  From these values the surface             emissivity may be determined and the target temperature accurately              measured for materials having arbitrary surface textures.  Quantum              Logic Corporation has developed and markets a line of single-                   wavelength laser-based active pyrometers, but they are effective                only for targets known in advance to have diffusely scattering or               perfectly specular surfaces.  Also, the semiconductor lasers                    required for these instruments are available only at wavelengths                suitable for very high temperature measurements.  We plan to                    develop a two-wavelength active pyrometer as described above                    employing non-coherent radiation sources which will be suitable for             a very wide range of temperatures and for targets having arbitrary              surface textures, thereby greatly extending the applications of                 active pyrometer technology.",
