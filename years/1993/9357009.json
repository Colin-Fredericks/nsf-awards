This work is directed toward understanding the  mechanisms by which these proteins, particularly those which span  the plasma membrane and are controlled by extracellular ligands,  regulate intracellular events.  The PI has focused his studies on  the action of a particular transmembrane PTK that is encoded by the  sevenless gene of Drosphilia melanogaster.  Mutations that  inactivate the sevenless protein (Sev) lead to a single known  defect in the fly.  Seven Enhancer of sevenless loci were  identified.  Mutations in four of the Enhancer of sevenless loci  also affect signaling by other receptor PTKs.  The PI has  concentrated on the analysis of these four loci in hopes that they  would encode components of a general PTK signaling pathway.  One  locus, Ras1, encodes a ras protein.  ras proteins are known to be  molecular switches that control many aspects of cellular activity.   How Ras1 is activated has therefore become the crucial question  which will be a major focus of this work.  %%%  This work explores a complex signal transduction system that  functions in cellular and organizational development and growth  control.  Since the components of this system are highly conserved  during evolution, it is likely that this knowledge gained will  apply to all PTK signalling systems.",
