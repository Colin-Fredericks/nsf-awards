 "awd_abstract_narration": "9224304  Caviness  This award supports the participation of eleven U.S. mathematicians  and computer scientists (including seven graduate students) in a  small symposium about computer algebra to be held near Linz,  Austria, in October, 1993.  The meeting is co-organized by  Professors Bobby F. Caviness of the University of Delaware, Jeremy  Johnson of Drexel University and Bruno Buchberger of the Research  Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC) at the Johannes Kepler  University in Linz, Austria.  Though established only a few years  ago, RISC has become a major center in areas of mathematics and  computer science relevant to a process known as cylindrical  algebraic decomposition (CAD).  The symposium will bring together  many leading researchers from Europe and the U.S. for the first time  to review and synthesize current knowledge about (CAD).  There will  be a one-day tutorial workshop in advance of the symposium to  introduce the fundamentals to the non-expert participants  (principally U.S. and Austrian graduate students and recent PhD's.)   Proceedings will be published in a forthcoming RISC series on  symbolic computation that will be published by Springer-Verlag.    Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a process devised to obtain  an improved quantifier elimination method for the theory of  elementary algebra and geometry.  Many important mathematical  problems can be stated in this theory and solved through quantifier  elimination.  CAD is therefore a major breakthrough in automating  mathematics and it has important applications in many recent  technologies (e.g., robot motion.)  As part of the broader field of  symbolic computation, requiring extensive training in both computer  systems and formal mathematics, it opens some of the most promising  directions for future software development.  ***",
