 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310554  Wilk  Around the world, the past is an increasingly contested terrain.   Historic and prehistoric remains play prominent roles in peoples'  attempts to define ethnic and national identities, at the same time  that looting, illegal trade, and site destruction are accelerating.   Archaeology is coming under closer public scrutiny and  archaeologists today are more concerned about ethical practice and  accountability.  There has been little research on the  archaeological enterprise, however.  Although archaeology can  promote cultural preservation and sustainable community  development, it can also fuel site destruction and contribute to  social conflict.  The overall problem this project addresses is the  ethical relationship between archaeologists and the communities  where they work, particularly in foreign cultural settings, and the  practical ramifications of this relationship in the forms of  looting, support for preservation, and public perceptions of the  past.  This project will survey and interview a broad sample of  archaeologists, finding out about their views about ethical  standards and behavior, and asking about the ways they have  conducted their own field research.  The survey will have three  sections:  one about practice, how do archaeologists conduct  themselves in the field in relation to host communities; the second  is an opinion survey aimed at eliciting archaeologists' perceptions  of minimal ethical behavior; and the third uses scenarios to  investigate the relationships between professional ethics and  broader social concerns for cultural integrity, autonomy,  hierarchy, and equality.  The survey is expected to sample 300 to  500 archaeologists; telephone interviews with 50 will provide  further detailed information about cases involving ethical concerns  and conflicts.  Results will provide documentation of prevailing  attitudes and practices among archaeologists, and ask if current  ethical standards and safeguards are sufficient.  ***",
