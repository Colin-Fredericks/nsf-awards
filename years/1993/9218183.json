 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years the stochastic point of view has achieved                  great prominence, both as an active area of probability theory and              as a powerful tool in problems of analysis, geometry, and                       mathematical physics.  For example, the classical Ito theory of                 stochastic differential equations, which defines a finite-                      dimensional diffusion process, already leads to many interesting                connections with analysis in Euclidean space and finite-dimensional             differentiable manifolds.  The same stochastic differential                     equations can also be used to define a stochastic flow, which is a              diffusion process on the group of diffeomorphisms, an infinite-                 dimensional space.  This naturally leads to the study of other                  infinite-dimensional processes, especially those defined by                     stochastic partial differential equations.                                           This project will support the 1993 AMS Summer Research                     Institute on Stochastic Analysis to be held July 11-30, 1993 at                 Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.  This Institute is the 41st in a              series designed with the purpose of bringing together a group of                mathematicians interested in a particular field of mathematical                 research.  Emphasis is placed on instruction at a very high level               with seminars and lectures by distinguished mathematicians in                   related fields, in order to promote interaction between                         participants while broadening their mathematical perspectives.  The             goal of the Institute will be to highlight the main directions of               the field through principal lectures by leaders in the following                general areas:  stochastic (ordinary) differential equations,                   applications to analysis, applications to geometry, stochastic                  flows, infinite dimensional problems, and stochastic partial                    differential equations.",
