 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the feasibility of using supercritical                wetting to introduce binary mixtures into highly porous silica                  gels.  A two-step process will be employed:  supercritical drying               (removing the solvent at temperatures and pressures above its gas-              liquid critical point where it evaporates without surface tension,              and then reversing the procedure to add the new solvent via                     supercritical wetting.  This new approach should preserve the fine              structure of the gel and allow us to study the effects of                       randomness, confinement, and wetting on the structure, dynamics and             phase transitions of a variety of non-water based fluid mixtures in             an important class of porous media.                                             %%%                                                                             The confinement of fluids within porous media can lead to dramatic              and complex changes in their physical behavior due to finite size               effects, wetting, and geometrical and chemical randomness in pore               size and structure.  This investigation will employ non-water-based             solutions.  Besides their fundamental scientific, such studies are              also of great practical-importance in areas such as secondary oil               recovery techniques and containment of societal wastes in landfills             and nuclear waste in underground storage sites.",
