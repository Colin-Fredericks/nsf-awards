 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352598  Haywick  The Department of Geology and Geography offers a variety of  undergraduate courses in the geosciences including components  of mineralogy, petrology, and sedimentology. Petrographic  techniques learned in these courses are vital to students  interested in pursuing graduate research in geology as well as  to geologists employed in the petroleum, hydrology and mineral  exploration industries. The Department is using a  cathodoluminoscope in the undergraduate teaching curriculum and  encouraging undergraduate students to use it in directed  research projects in the fields of sedimentology, mineralogy,  petrology and low temperature geochemistry. The addition of a  cathodoluminoscope to the department significantly improves  undergraduate teaching in a wide variety of geology courses.  Students benefit by gaining more comprehensive knowledge of  lecture material and through the technical skills they develop  during cathodoluminescence analysis and thin-section  microscopy. This greatly enriches their understanding of  geological processes and gives them the knowledge they need  when competing for entry to graduate schools or the work force.  ***",
