 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal objective of this research is to study the                        intramolecular dynamics of some very important classes of                       ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules and several members of a family                of calcium-binding proteins.  Experimental data on dynamical                    processes in these biomolecules will be obtained via the                        measurements of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation rate                constants; development of appropriate methodologies for measuring               heteronuclear relaxation rate constants will be necessary.  NMR                 spectroscopy is a powerful method for obtaining detailed, site-                 specific information on the structure and dynamics of small- to                 medium-sized biomolecules in solution.  By measuring various NMR                relaxation rate constants for specific nuclei in molecule it is                 possible in principle to characterize the types, amplitudes and                 rates of various internal motions over a wide range of time                     scales.  The specific aim in the RNA studies is to determine the                general characteristics of dynamical processes in RNAs, such as                 the relative mobilities of bases and sugars in loops and duplex                 regions, the dynamics of nucleotides in loop regions or bugles                  compared to nucleotides in duplexes, and the relative mobilities                of mismatched basepairs compared to standard Watson-Crick                       basepairs.  The specific aim of the protein research is to study                the internal dynamics of several members of a calmodulin                        superfamily of calcium-binding proteins.                                        %%%                                                                             The internal mobility and flexibility of biomolecules play key                  roles in virtually all biological processes; for example,                       fundamental processes such as enzyme activity, molecular                        recognition and various molecular transport mechanisms depend                   heavily on the intramolecular dynamics of participating proteins,               nucleic acids and other biomolecules.  Thus, to obtain a better                 understanding of the physical basis for the functional activity                 of these biomolecules it is extremely important to probe their                  dynamical properties.  To date very few physical studies have                   been made of the structure and dynamics of RNAs, and thus the                   proposed NMR experiments should provide invaluable information                  regarding these molecules which have a central role in so many                  fundamental, cellular processes.  The dynamics studies of the                   calcium-binding proteins will be very important for understanding               their functional activity and for helping to establish the basic                principles underlying the inter-relationships of protein                        structure, function and dynamics.  The calcium ion functions as a               second messenger in a range of biological processes.  In these                  systems, transient variations in the concentration of calcium ion               are translated by regulatory calcium-binding proteins, which                    undergo conformational changes when they bind calcium ions.  The                structural aspects of calcium-binding proteins have been under                  investigation in many laboratories for some time, but only                      recently has it become feasible to study in detail their                        internal, dynamical properties.",
