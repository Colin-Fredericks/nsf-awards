 "awd_abstract_narration": "9221408  Albright  The objectives of this study are to understand and improve the  process of alkylating isobutane with light olefins using sulfuric  acid as a catalyst.  The reaction mixture is an emulsion consisting  of sulfuric acid and a liquid hydrocarbon mixture of isobutane,  olefins, and alkylate product (a mixture of isoparaffins with 5-12  carbon atoms).  Nature and rates of chemical and physical  transformations in the emulsion or across the interface are  determined.  Interfacial area will be measured by a novel method.   Kinetic models incorporating interfacial area are developed.   Approaches to increasing the interfacial area are examined,  including increased agitation, higher acid/hydrocarbon ratios, and  the use of surfactants or other additives.    Clean fuel considerations are increasing demand for alkylates as  fuel enhancers at the same time that environmental protection  considerations are forcing a phase-out of the most common catalyst  for producing them:  hydrogen fluoride.  This study is a new look  at an earlier generation of catalyst to see if improvements in the  process can make it competitive.  This is an industry-university  cooperative project with Stratco, Inc. of Leawood KS.",
