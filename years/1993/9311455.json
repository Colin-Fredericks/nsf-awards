 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311455  Cox    The concept of Nash equilibrium (NE) has become central to game  theory and to much of modern economics.  It is used to understand  and predict a broad range of economic phenomena.  NE is in fact a  rather persuasive idea:  Each individual has no incentive to act  differently than the NE specifies he will, so long as he believes  that the other participants will actually choose the actions the  NE specifies for them.  But the cogency of the NE concept depends   upon each player in a game having correct beliefs about what the  other players will do.  Several recent papers have developed  models in which players learn to play NE -- they learn to have  mutually correct beliefs -- through repeated play of a game.   This proposal describes a program of experimental research  designed to examine and test some of this recent theoretical  work.      One focus of the experimental research will be to determine  whether people generally learn to play some NE but not others.   The research will therefore potentially both support and refine  the use of NE.  It will provide a foundation, for example, for  determining whether an economic institution (either an existing  institution, or a newly devised solution to an economic problem)  produces desirable outcomes. When as often happens, an  institution has multiple Nash equilibria, some of them socially  desirable and some not, this research will help to determine  whether people learn to play the desirable outcomes or the  undesirable ones.  ***",
