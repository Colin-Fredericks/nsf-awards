 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is intended to improve the mathematics instruction                 by making effective use of state-of-the-art computers and                       associated technological equipment. Innovations in the teaching                 of mathematical concepts have been made possible by advances in                 computer hardware and software. We need to ensure that our                      teachers can use these technological advances to their fullest                  potential. This project will establish a laboratory to provide                  practical classroom activities and demonstrations for                           prospective elementary and secondary teachers.We will replace                   our outdated lab of Apple II computers with a network of                        Macintosh workstations, a file server, a CD-ROM player, a video                 disk player and a scanner. This local network will be connected                 to our existing campus network and through it to the internet,                  giving our students access to a growing network connecting                      elementary and secondary post-secondary educators.For our                       education students in mathematics to be trained to teach at a                   world-class level, they need experiences on state-of-the-art                    equipment. This equipment will enable our students to learn                     problem solving strategies, programming, and applications on                    equipment that will be the latest currently available. Thus,                    our students will be able to contribute their expertise to the                  community-at-large upon graduation.",
