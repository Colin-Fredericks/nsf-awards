 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is creating an introductory laboratory environment                  in which the student is allowed to focus attention as                           completely as possible on physics principles.  This is being                    accomplished by eliminating distractions of poorly functioning                  equipment, outmoded data collection techniques, and                             mathematical tedium.  Modern, up-to-date computers, electronic                  data collection via transducers, and software for data analysis                 are being used in the introductory physics laboratory.  The new                 environment allows students to identify more easily the                         underlying physical principles and explore their consequences                   more efficiently and effectively than previously possible.                      Many of the experiments emphasize the relevance of physics to                   everyday life.  These improvements are improving student                        interest in physics as a possible career or as a component of                   their education.A secondary goal is the enhancement of the                      technological awareness of the introductory students.  It is                    desired that students will effectively use modern techniques in                 more advanced laboratory settings, whether physics or other                     areas.  By integrating the data collection process with video-                  assisted tutorial presentations and analysis and display of                     results, the students are using the power of this more advanced                 equipment without treating it as a \"black box\".  It is believed                 that the result of this project will be physics students with                   a better grasp of physical principles, of the technology                        necessary to solve them, and will appreciate the role physics                   plays in their every day lives.",
