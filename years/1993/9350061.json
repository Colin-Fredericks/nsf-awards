 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Nelson will carry out research in particle theory.  The time                period that she will be at University of California-Santa Barbara               coincides with the workshop \"Weak Interactions\" which will take                 place at the Institute for Theoretical Physics at Santa Barbara.                This subject overlaps with her research interests and she will                  collaborate with several of the people attending the workshop.  Dr.             Nelson's research will focus on several aspects of the general area             of electroweak symmetry breaking:  electroweak baryogenesis, and                dynamical supersymmetry breaking in the visible sector.                                                                                                         Interactive activities at the host institution include:  presenting             a participatory seminar course for UCSB upper division physics                  majors on theoretical physics in order to encourage talented                    undergraduates to continue their involvement in physics, attending              and giving research seminars and collaborating with the faculty,                postdocs, and graduate students.                                                                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineers               employed in industry, government, and academic institutions.  By                encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
