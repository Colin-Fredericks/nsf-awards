 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308139  Myerson    The goal of this project is to develop a better understanding of  how the design of political institutions can affect political  behavior, with hope that such understanding may be valuable for  guiding decisions about constitutional design in new and reforming  democracies.  In particular, the researcher will continue his  research on game-theoretic comparison of political institutions by  looking into several extensions.    First, electoral systems will be compared by analyzing large finite  voting games in which the numbers of voters of different types are  independent random variables.  Then the effectiveness of different  electoral systems for reducing government corruption by considering  single transferable vote and other electoral systems will be  investigated.  Second, the tendency of plurality voting elections  to become two-party contests is known as Duverger's law.  The  investigator will work to derive Duverger's law from game-theoretic  analysis.      Third, a variety of game-theoretic models that may account for  observed differences between parliamentary and presidential systems  will be studied.  This question has been an important area of study  in the empirical literature on comparative politics, but there is  a need for game-theoretic models to guide and complement empirical  work.  Finally, the investigator's long term plan is to integrate  the results of his research, together with other related results in  formal political theory and social choice theory, into a general  monograph on game-theoretic models for comparing political  institutions.    ***",
