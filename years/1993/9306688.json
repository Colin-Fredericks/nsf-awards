 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306688  Randall    Striking the hind feet on the ground to create mechanical vibrations has evolved  independently in several rodent families around the world.  Although foot-drumming behavior  is common in desert rodents from North and South Africa, Middle East, Central Russia,  Asia, and North America, it has been studied in detail only in the Southwestern United States  in the banner-tailed kangaroo rat.  Dr. Randall has found that foot-drumming by the  banner-tails is part of a communication system:  the rats create individually distinct foot-  drumming signatures that are used to identify neighbors during territorial defense.  She now  seeks to understand the evolution of foot-drumming as communication through comparing the  banner-tails with three species of kangaroo rat from different locations and habitats.  The new  species include the giant kangaroo rat, a federally listed endangered species that lives in open  grassland, the desert kangaroo rat, which lives in sand dunes, and the Heerman's kangaroo  rat from rocky slopes.  Of primary interest will be between-species comparisons by age, sex,  and individual of the foot-drumming signal in the contexts of territorial defense, competition  for resources and mates, and in predator defense.  Playback experiments will test for species,  sex and individual recognition of identified foot-drumming signals.    This is the first comparative study of foot-drumming in closely related species, and as such  will contribute to a general understanding of how this unique communication system evolved.   Results of this study can help us understand why so many rodents in the world's deserts have  evolved foot-drumming behavior.  This research should also provide valuable information  about desert communities and assist in development of recovery plans for endangered species  of kangaroo rats.",
