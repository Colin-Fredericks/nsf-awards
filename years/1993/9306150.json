 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will continue his research on the model                   theory of structures related to real and complex numbers.  In                   particular, he will focus on definability questions in expansions               with extra analytic structure.  Most of his work over the past                  five years has been concentrated in this area.  He will attempt                 to prove further results of the following character.  (1) Marker,               Macintyre, and van den Dries have shown that the structure of the               real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                        functions is O-minimal and admits elimination of quantifiers.                   O-minimality implies that there is a rich structure theory for                  the definable sets.  (2) Marker and Pillay have shown that any                  non-trivial reduct of an algebraically closed field that contains               addition is strong enough to recover the full field structure.                  (3) Marker has shown that if any non-trivial real structure is                  added to the complex numbers, then the real numbers are                         definable.  These latter two results can be thought of as                       attempts to examine the boundary of algebraic geometry.  The                    first says that weakening algebraic geometry leads to little more               than linear geometry.  The second says that extending algebraic                 geometry leads to the full complications of real algebraic                      geometry.                                                                            While \"definability\" is a logical notion, often it turns out               that the definable sets are ones which arise naturally and are of               great importance.  Model theoretic methods provide a new tool for               their study.  For example, the sets definable in the structure of               the real numbers with exponentiation and restricted analytic                    functions arise naturally in studying analytic geometry,                        dynamical systems, statistics, and control theory.",
