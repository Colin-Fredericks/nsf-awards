 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310932  Santore    This research equipment grant (REG) project provides in part for  the purchase of a high resolution photon counting  spectrofluorometer (Spex FL 112) and for the materials for home-  built accessories are requested.  The instrument's main role  will be in the development of novel probes and experimental  techniques for advanced materials processing and biosciences;  however, it will also facilitate workhorse fluorescence assays  for students in Chemical Engineering, Molecular Biology,  Emulsion Polymers Institute, Polymer Interfaces Center, and the  Center for Molecular Biology and Biosciences.    Novel probe development requires an internal sample cell, the  construction of a total internal reflection shear cell, and an  optical interface to external experiments.  These configurations  have been designed for rapid interchange, facilitating several  projects in the immediate future:  (1) Development of non-  radiative energy transfer (NET) to probe the evolution of  segment-surface contacts and provide insight into the molecular  mechanisms for adsorption and desorption of polymers.  (2)  Development of a spectroscopic pH-ruler to monitor slow  relaxations of adsorbed polymers.  (3) Development of a  homogeneous immunoassay relying on a  quenching mechanism and  comparison of this assay to one exploiting polarization. (4)  Studies of enzyme adsorption and activity changes on hydrophobic  surfaces. (5) Solution structures of hydrophobically-modified  comb polymers and their impact on rheology and (6) The effect of  swelling, ion and water transport, and physical aging on the  mechanical properties of films on rigid substrates.",
