 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a six-month long-term visit to Japan by                 Professor Antonio Nanni, Department of Architectural Engineering                at the Pennsylvania State University.  He will be undertaking a                 cooperative research project with Dr. Kazuhisa Yahagi, Technical                Research Institute, Mitsui Construction Company in Tokyo and                    Professor Masanori Tsuji, Department of Civil Engineering,                      Science University of Tokyo in Noda.  They will be researching                  the area of fiber-reinforced-plastic (FPR) composites for use as                reinforcing elements in concrete structures.  This will involve                 testing the fire-resistance of FRP reinforced concrete members to               be sure it holds up to currently established standards and does                 not overheat or lose strengtrh in its rods when exposed to                      flaming fire.  In addition, they will be studying the release of                toxic products resulting from ignited FRP materials.  They will                 further research the substitution of a thermoplastic resin to                   replace the more common thermoset resin.  This may offer improved               corrosion resistance and enhanced drainage tolerance.  It could                 also reduce the processing time and may provide a cleaner working               environment and infinite shelf life.  This research will be                     followed by the preparation of educational materials,                           encompasssing the properties and design of this new construction                material, to be used for instructional purposes.                                                                                                                This research will likely result in the use of FRP in building                  construction which is currently being seriously considered by                   building designers because of the potential of improving                        manufacturing and lowering production costs.  Professor Yahagi is               a first-rate researcher and his Institute has recently acquired                 new facilities including a fire hood and a braiding machine which               allows fire testing and manufacturing of the FRP composites.  The               Japanese construction industry is far more advanced in this                     technology than the U.S.  Professor Nanni, who is a U.S. expert                 in this area, should obtain valuable information that he would be               unable to obtain in the U.S.  Professor Tsuji has visited                       Professor Nanni at his university for three months and this                     experience should assist them in the formulation of a curriculum                course incorporating the reserach findings and new technologies                 for using FRP in building construction.  Since previous                         collaborations between these researchers have been successful, it               is anticipated that results from this project will be fruitful,                 as well, and of possible use throughout the world",
