 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal focus of this project is panel data,i.e., data                    which contain repeated observations over time for each                          individual.  Panel data are increasingly the data of choice for                 empirical economic research in labor and industrial organization                because the data capture both changes over time and cross-                      sectional relationships at a given point of time.  Existing                     statistical tools do not permit economists to utilize all of the                rich informational detail provided by panel data.   This project                provides applied economists with statistical tools that will do                 as better job in exploiting the information in panel data.  The                 research project also extends methods for estimating changes of                 industry technological inefficiency and it improves forecasting                 methods for rational expectations models.                                                                                                                       More specifically, the research on panel data has three                         components.  First, the project considers the dynamic panel data                model, in which one of the explanatory variables is the lagged                  value of the dependent variable.  Existing estimators for this                  model are inefficient, because they fail to utilize all of the                  available moment conditions, and the efficiency gains from using                all moment conditions are quantified.  Second, various panel data               models with autocorrelated errors are considered.  Once again it                is possible to find efficient estimators that make use of all                   available moment conditions, and the interesting question is to                 find equally efficient estimators that use less conditions; that                is, to find out which conditions are superfluous.  Third, the                   project investigates a model with interactive individual and time               effects.  A connection is made between generalized method of                    moments and likelihood-based approaches to this model, and the                  model is extended to the case of more than one interactive                      component.   In addition, the project extends the literature on                 frontier production functions in ways that allow a flexible                     pattern of technical inefficiency over time.  The project                       investigates the possible efficiency gains in estimation of                     rational expectations models from the use of observable forecast                errors.",
