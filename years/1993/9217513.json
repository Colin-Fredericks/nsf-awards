 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports U.S.-France cooperative research                 in microelectronics among Dimitris Pavlidis, University of                      Michigan, Frederique Ducroquet, National Institute for Applied                  Sciences (INSA), and S. K. Krawczyk of the Ecole Centrale in                    Lyon, France.  The objective of the project is to study                         optimization, process control and reliability of high electron                  mobility transistors (HEMTs).  The basic heterostructures for                   HEMTs will be grown, designed, fabricated and electrically                      characterized at the University of Michigan.  These samples will                be further analyzed by various material characterization                        techniques developed at INSA and the Ecole Centrale in Lyon.                    The investigators will characterize the material under optimum                  growth conditions, analyze the process and defects induced by                   thermal stress.                                                                                                                                                 The U.S. investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in                 performance optimization of HEMTS and other electronic                          devices and the fabrication of novel HEMTs.  This is                            complemented by French expertise in various characterization                    techniques, which include photo and electro-reflectance                         characterization.  The results from the material analysis will                  advance understanding of the effects of growth conditions on                    material properties and the reliability of such structures.  Such               studies are important to the development of new semiconductor                   devices.",
