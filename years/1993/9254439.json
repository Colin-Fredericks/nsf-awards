 "awd_abstract_narration": "9254439  Hooper  The Project to Improve Science Models (PRISM) is a multifaceted  plan to improvethe science preparation of all prospective  teachers of grades 1-9 by transformingpreservice courses and  field experiences.  Objectives of this project are university  faculty collaborating with professional teachers to effect the  undergraduate educationof pre-service teachers in order to:  increase understanding of science concepts,processes and  skills; develop creative skills and positive attitudes toward  science; and ultimately transfer these competencies into  classrooms.  The major components of the project include the  development of:  three core content courses (12 semester hours)  integrating six science disciplines; a 3 semester hour infused  methods course; effective modeling of multimedia instructional  technology; a mentor teacher network, and a science resource  center.  The project is a collaboration developed by a steering  committee of eight teachers working with university faculty,  input from both Arts and Sciences faculty and Education  faculty,  60 area teachers, and a local educational consortia,  CESAs.  The University faculty is designing integrated courses  infusing multimedia technology; the teachers serve as mentors  for over 1000 prospective teachers; and, CESAs provides  technical assistance, educational materials, and  logistical support.  Materials being developed make the project  model available and transportable so as to affect positive  changes in 1-9 preservice teacher education.  ***y",
