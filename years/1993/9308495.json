Effective policies for managing development of such  regions depend upon a clear and detailed understanding of  how colonists have used the landscape and how their uses  change over time.  Previous studies have examined  deforestation in such regions by means of satellite  overviews, often without the benefit of field data.  This  study applies multispectral remote sensing data to identify  land use patterns in a recently colonized region of  Rondonia, Brazil.  It performs a detailed examination of  land use on a lot-by-lot, field-by-field basis for the  period 1986 to 1992.  It will focus on changes in forested  area and upon land uses that have replaced forested areas  during colonization.  Through analysis of changes in land  cover the research will isolate those biologic, social, and  economic processes which contribute to deforestation.  Of  particular interest is the regrowth of forest after  abandonment of economic activity, and how the differences  between primary and secondary growth forest can be  determined through spectral images from satellite data.       Research on global change includes not only analysis of  ways in which human activity modifies physical environments,  but also the speed and character of regeneration of natural  systems.  This research project, combining use of remotely  sensed data with ground observations and social surveys,  will enhance understanding of the role of human activity in  the complex processes of deforestation and forest  regeneration in ecologically senstive areas of the world.  ***",
