 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional economic theory presumes that decision makers have no               limits on their ability to absorb and process information, to carry             out calculations, or to explore the implications of alternative                 courses of action.  In reality, however, economic agents often face             problems that are too complex for any individual to treat in this               way.  Therefore, it is important to examine whether the results of              traditional models are robust when the assumption of unlimited                  informational capacity is relaxed.                                                                                                                              The focus of this project is to analyze a new way of describing                 limits on this capacity.  Specifically, each decision maker is                  represented by a network of simple computers.  The aggregate                    computational power of a network often exceeds the sum of the                   capabilities of individual machines.  Small but well designed                   computer networks can store and process substantial amounts of                  information.  Notion of complexity will be formalized, and the                  implications of limited capacity to handle complexity will be                   investigated.  In addition, such networks will be used to study                 adaptive learning processes.                                                                                                                                    Some of the initial results obtained in this framework are                      strikingly different from those found in the existing literature on             bounded rationality.  It is then essential to further this research             by critically reviewing the existing tools for modeling the limited             informational capability of economic agents.",
