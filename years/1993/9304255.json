The                   organizers of the meeting are Robert Ivarie and Lawrence J.                     Shimkets.  The conference is composed of six sessions:  1)                      Microbial Development;  2) Early Steps in Development;  3) Plant                Development;  4) Cell Determination and Pattern Formation;  5)                  Regulation of Gene Expression; and  6) Growth Factors and                       Development.  To add additional interest we have invited two                    nationally prominent developmental biologists to give keynote                   addresses, Dr. P. O'Farrell from the University of California, San              Francisco, and Dr. W. Timberlake from the University of Georgia.                In addition, all participants will have the opportunity to present              posters.  This meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for                scientists and their students from Alabama, Florida, Georgia,                   Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, South               Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia to meet and                    exchange ideas and information on developmental biology.  Based on              the attendance of recent meetings, 120-150 participants are                     expected.  Partial support is requested from NSF to help defray                 room and board expenses for graduate students attending the                     conference.",
