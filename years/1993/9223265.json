 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seagrasses are distributed along the margins of all but the most                polar seas and form the basis of some of the most productive plant              communities in the world.  They play important ecological roles in              nutrient cycling, sediment deposition and binding, provision of                 habitat for a large and diverse fauna, and contribute significantly             to nearshore food webs.  Eelgrass, Zostera marina, is found                     typically in monotypic stands in nearshore waters characterized by              light limitation and the presence of anoxic, organic-rich                       sediments.  The very nature of eelgrass habitats imposes diurnal                and often prolonged hypoxia/anoxia on subterranean tissues and                  severe restrictions on carbon gain.  The ability of eelgrass to                 withstand and recover from these conditions must underlie its                   ecological success.  Ongoing studies have begun to examine the                  physiological and biochemical mechanisms responsible for the                    success of eelgrass in these habitats.  This research project will              build on prior research and advance current understanding, beyond               a simple accounting of whole plant carbon budgets, to the                       biochemical and molecular features that dictate integrated plant                responses to submarine light environments and anoxic sediments.                 This research will address the fundamental mechanisms by which                  submarine light regimes control the survival depth, growth and                  productivity of Zostera marina, and elucidate the primary                       physiological, biochemical and molecular features of this species               that ensure its ecological success in littoral environments.  In                particular, this project will investigate the controls on carbon                partitioning between shoots and roots in Zostera marina,  and                   initiate molecular examinations to determine the relative                       importance of translational and transcription events in regulating              root responses to diurnal and prolonged anoxia.  This project                   should provide the needed mechanistic understanding of the major                factors that control the distribution and carbon allocation                     strategies of eelgrass, so that this level of sophistication can be             incorporated into a predictive numerical model of growth and                    productivity for this species.  The knowledge gained form these                 studies will not only advance our understanding of factors that                 control marine benthic productivity and contribute to our basic                 understanding of the adaptive mechanisms that function in plants,               but provide information essential to sound and informed management              of submerged macrophytes.",
