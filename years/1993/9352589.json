 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Computational Discovery Laboratory, an interdisciplinary                    state-of-the-art computer teaching laboratory, will provide                     biological, physical, mathematical, and social science majors                   at Benedictine College with the technology to learn and                         discover for themselves in a supervised environment. It will                    also support faculty/student research. The Computational                        Discovery Laboratory, consisting of eight Quadra 950s with                      appropriate software, will have a ninth mobile computer which                   will serve as a projection platform in the Laboratory and allow                 for demonstrations in traditional classrooms and laboratories.                  The Laboratory will be used for a wide variety of applications,                 including interfacing with biology instruments using MacLab,                    simulating chemistry experiments using Gantt, solving symbolic                  mathematics equations using Mathematica in physics and                          mathematics classes, writing computer programs in a structured                  laboratory setting in computer science classes, and analyzing                   data using SPSS in psychology, political science, and sociology                 classes. The computers will be networked with the College's                     minicomputer, allowing students access other programming                        languages and, providing access to Internet/Bitnet when that                    becomes available. The Laboratory will serve as a model of how                  a group of departments at a small college can share a facility                  in order to provide state-of-the-art computing facilities for                   their majors.",
