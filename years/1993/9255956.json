 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tulsa will initiate a four-week, residential                  Young Scholars project in Engineering Technology for 35 students                entering grades 9,10.                                                                                                                                           The primary component of the program is the summer session in which             the scholars interact with departmental faculty, undergraduate                  students, and representatives from local industry.  The hands-on                activities will include engineering laboratory experiments,                     computer workshops, and a design project.  The academic year will               include follow-up activities designed to reinforce the students'                experiences in engineering.  Each of the four follow-up sessions                will focus on a specific issue in engineering and will include                  hands-on workshops conducted by industrial mentors and faculty.  A              major goal of the program is to increase awareness of engineering               as a career potential for Native American, minority, and women                  students.  A high priority is given to students with high potential             for engineering but with limited prior exposure to engineering or               science.",
