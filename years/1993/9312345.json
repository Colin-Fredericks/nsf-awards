 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312345  Skinner  The objective of this project is to  investigate the usefulness of Kerr-  Type nonlinear optical materials  for all-optical implementations of  feed forward artificial neural  networks with optical error back-  propagation training.  These types  of materials have pico-second  response times and allow both  weighted connections and nonlinear  neuron processing to be implemented  using thin materials layers  separated by free space.  This  gives such networks and advantage  over other optical implementations  which require complicated hardware  devices to implement the weighted  connections and separate hardware  for neuron processing. In addition,  a layered network of Kerr-Type  material can process both forward  calculation signals and backward  error propagation simultaneously.   The nonlinear layers serve as  processing layers and the linear  layers (fee space) serve as  connection layers.  Each nonlinear  layer can be thought of as a plane  continuum of neurons connected with  the layers before and after it by a  continuum of optical paths.  The  number of available neurons and  connections are limited only by the  available resolution of the system  optics.  The inputs and weights are  a distribution of irradiance in 2D  space and the weights vary the  refractive index profile of the  nonlinear medium.  The nonlinear  forcing and processing functions  necessary for neural computing are  given by the self-action effects of  the propagating wave coupled with  the optical with signals applied to  the nonlinear layers.  Such a  network has been numerically  simulated in two dimensions and  trained to perform logic functions  and a simple optical demonstration  of this network is constructed.   Further simulation and training of  the network to preform more  complicated tasks as well as  implementation of these networks in  two dimensions is proposed,  followed by an extension of the  simulation and implementation to  three dimensions.  This well  involve both theoretical and   experimental investigations in  parallel with computer simulation  to determine the optimal network  geometry (number and type of  layers, size and required  resolution of with and signal  fields) as well as better  techniques for controlling the  application of the weight light  fields.  ***",
