 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mature oil seeds (cucumber, pumpkin, peanut, Brassica, etc) contain             few mitochondria and have low levels of tricarboxylic acid (TCA)                cycle enzymes.  Following imbibition the TCA cycle enzymes are                  synthesized de novo.  The biogenesis of the TCA cycle enzymes,                  however, is not uniform.  The non-decarboxylative portion of the                pathway (the reactions between succinate and oxaloacetate) is                   synthesized first.  A few days later, the enzymes of the                        decarboxylative part of the cycle, the reactions between pyruvate               (or citrate) and succinate, are formed.  This switch results from               changing metabolism in the cotyledons of these seeds.  Early in                 germination the cotyledons are converting stored lipid to                       carbohydrate.  While the non-decarboxylative portion of the TCA                 cycle is essential for this process the decarboxylative portion is              not present thus preventing carbon loss through the decarboxylation             reactions.  Later as these tissues become photosynthetic, a full                TCA cycle is needed and the enzymes of the decarboxylative portion              are synthesized.  In this proposal Dr. Oliver will examine the                  mechanism by which this differential expression of mitochondrial                proteins is accomplished using fumarase, an enzyme specific for the             non-decarboxylative part, and the NAD+-dependent isocitrate                     dehydrogenase, an enzyme found only in the decarboxylative portion              of the TCA cycle.  The proteins have been purified, antibody tools              are being produced, and N-terminal sequence information is being                obtained.  The antibody and/or oligonucleotide probes will be used              to isolate the cDNA (and then genomic) clones for these two                     proteins.  The level of control of gene expression(transcriptional,             translational, etc) will be determined by measuring mRNA levels and             with run on transcription assays.  Promoter-GUS contructs will be               transformed into Brassica napus and these transgenic plants will be             used to study, 1. the time course and tissue specificity of                     expression of both genes, 2. environmental and physiological                    factors that control the expression of these two genes, and 3.                  repression of TCA cycle proteins during seed maturation.  Promoter              analysis will be initiated.  These studies may be augmented by the              use of transient expression assays and rapid cycling Brassica or                Arabidopsis.",
