 "awd_abstract_narration": "9308492  Barton       Computer simulation models are the laboratory for many today's  design engineers.  Circuits are simulated before they are  prototyped, exhaust systems are represented as finite element  simulations before they are built, and factories are modeled with  discrete event simulation before the ground is broken for a new  plant.  \"Laboratory\" tools for: (1) modeling random manufacturing  variations, (2) for identifying key design parameters, (3) for  developing and displaying simulation metamodels and (4) for aiding  in robust design optimization exist in engineering research.  Yet  they have not been transferred to engineering practice.  A new  graduate course, \"Using Simulation Models for Engineering Design,\"  presents recent research results in simulation sensitivity  analysis, metamodeling, and optimization for use in engineering  design case studies.  The case studies are based on computer aided  design models that have been developed and used in industry.       The department advisory group assessed the initial offering  as a significant contribution to a revised engineering curriculum,  but cited these key shortcomings: (1) the students spend  unnecessary time programming because software tools to exercise the  case study software are lacking, and (2) refinements and additions  to the lecture notes would make it easier to understand and  implement these tools.  This research to overcome these  shortcomings.",
