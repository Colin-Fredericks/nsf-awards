These papers serve both pure and applied purposes,                  contributing to the field of research in undergraduate mathematics              education and informing the direct improvement of undergraduate                 mathematics instruction.  The dual purposes imply dual but                      overlapping audiences.  Papers focus on learning within particular              mathematical domains as well as on more general cognitive process               such as problem solving, skill acquisition, conceptual development,             mathematical creativity, and cognitive styles.  Papers also deal                with issues associated with variations in teaching methods, or                  classroom and laboratory contexts.  More broadly, research may                  address institutional arrangements intended to support learning and             teaching; for example, curriculum design, assessment practices, or              strategies for faculty development.",
