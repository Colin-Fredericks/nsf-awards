 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312521  Drennan    Under the direction of Dr. Robert Drennan, Ms. Lilliam Arvello will  collect data for her doctoral dissertation. Coordinating her work  with that of a larger project she will conduct archaeological  research in the Quibor Valley of northwestern Venezuela. This area  is of interest because of both the rich prehistoric remains it  contains and the archaeological attention which, in the past, has  been directed to it. Ms. Arvello will determine the exploitable  resources in the region and how these varied through time and  space, and also examine how human settlement patterns changed in  size and structure over time. She will survey a total of 30,000 ha.  of the valley using standard techniques. On the basis of aerial  photographs and maps, the area will be divided into survey units,  each of which will be 100% covered by pedestrian survey. All  surface scatters and sites identified will be plotted. Surface  collections will be made at each site and systematic intensive  surface collection and test pit excavations will be done in  selected locations. On this basis it will be possible to determine  spatial changes in settlement pattern over time and to examine the  degree of both inter and intra site variability in different  periods.    Although Northeastern South America has received less  archaeological attention than the Mayan region to the North or the  Incan culture of the Andes, this area is important because the same  basic processes which led from simple to complex societies took  place here as well. Archaeological evidence indicates a progression  from small unstratified social groupings to larger and more  stratified chiefdom level societies. The Quibor Valley has rich  agricultural lands and archaeological sites in this region preserve  paleobotanical information. Researchers have postulated that the  introduction of maize and the supposed increase in population  density which this allowed is responsible for the emergence of  complex societies in this area. However th e data are scanty and Ms.  Arvelo's work should provide a more convincing test of this  hypothesis.    This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will increase our  understanding of how complex societies developed and will  contribute to the training of a promising young scientist.  ***",
