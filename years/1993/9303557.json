 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our research is oriented toward implementation of Bayesian  inference. There has been increasing interest recently in the  Bayesian approach to statistics, in part because advances in  computational ability have made it feasible in many settings, and  in part because Bayesian analysis of data can make use of  information from additional sources. Our work will build on our  previous research in Bayesian statistics, part of which has been  funded by NSF. Our main concerns are: (1) review and assessment  of methods for choosing prior probability distributions by formal  rules, and further development of methods for assessing  sensitivity to the choices; (2) investigation of approximate and  exact computational methods for Bayesian hypotheses testing; (3)  modification and enhancement of numerical integration techniques  and Monte Carlo simulation of posterior distributions; also,  improvement of statistical computing environments including use  of animation and three dimensional rendering for visualization of  uncertainty in higher dimensions; (4) further work on the  foundations of subjective probability; and (5) several other  topics related to our previous work on elicitation of priors and  asymptotic approximations.  When analyzing data, it is important  to combine all sources of information effectively.  Bayesian  statistical methods are tailored to this purpose.  Our research  focuses on finding practical ways to implement Bayesian methods  and on investigating the theoretical basis for these methods.  We are concerned with the development of computational and  graphical techniques that make Bayesian inference feasible in  complicated problems.  These include: simulation, animation and  the construction of statistical computing environments.  We will  also investigate theoretical issues that support Bayesian  techniques. These issues include the foundations of subjective  probability and the development of mathematical approximations.",
