 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Late Proterozoic glacial sequences are known from almost all of             the major cratonic areas, including North America, the Gondwana                 continents, and the Baltic Platform.  A major controversy involves              the probable latitude of formation for these deposits--were they                formed at relatively high latitudes as were those of the Permian                and our modern glacial deposits, or were many of them formed much               closer to the equator?  Arguments supporting a low depositional                 latitude for many of these units have been discussed extensively                for the past 30 years, beginning with the field observations that               some of the diamictites had a peculiar abundance of carbonate                   fragments, as if the ice had marched over carbonate platforms.                  Paleomagnetic data have been involved to both support and attack                the low-latitude interpretations of these deposits.  However, much              of the older paleomagnetic data is not as convincing as it should               be, particularly in terms of using geological stability tests to                constrain the time that the remanent magnetization was acquired.                A recent and important exception to this is the paleomagnetic work              on the varved sediments of the Elatina formation of South                       Australia, which formed during the uppermost Marinoan glaciation.               At least on one continent, these extensive, sea-level deposits were             formed by widespread continental glaciers which came to within a                few degrees of the equator.  If this is also true of other                      continents such as Africa, the results would be difficult to                    interpret in any fashion other than that of a widespread equatorial             glaciation of global extent.  This Australian example demonstrates              the need for similar, rigorous paleomagnetic studies on other                   Proterozoic glacial units.  During the past 10 years, geological                work on Proterozoic glacial sequences in Southern Africa has                    clarified their regional stratigraphic framework and tectonic                   setting.  Several new targets for paleomagnetic work are now                    available which are of exceptionally low metamorphic grade and lend             themselves to detailed micro-fold and conglomerate tests.  Funds                are requested in this proposal to support the field sampling of                 these units in Southern Africa and Namibia during June and July of              l993, and to support the laboratory paleomagnetic analyses in the               first half of 1994.",
