Six faculty members whose research is dependent                  upon high resolution mass spectroscopy will greatly benefit                     from the acquisition of this instrument.  Research projects to                  be carried out with this instrument include:  (1) The mechanism                 of action of vitamin K, (2) New synthetic methods for an                        industrial environment, (3) Total organic synthesis of natural                  products, (4) Gas phase ion chemistry, (5) Molecular                            recognition:  Novel artifical receptors for complexation and                    catalysis and (6) Research on Molecular recognition.                            %%%                                                                                                                                                             A high resolution mass spectrometer is an instrument used to                    measure the precise molecular weight of a molecular ion.  This                  information is an important piece of data used to help                          determine the atomic composition and, sometimes, the molecular                  geometry of a molecule.  It is one of the essential tools                       needed to learn the detailed structure of newly synthesized                     molecules.",
