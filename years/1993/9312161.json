They  arise at all stages from prior mitigation to reconstruction, and  with respect to all kinds of hazards, whether earthquakes or  floods.  Rarely do those making management policies and decisions  see them explicitly as involving ethical choices; typically, they  view them in technical, political and economic terms.  This project  seeks to expand the understanding of the nature of ethical issues  which arise in the area of natural hazards management, and of the  variety of concepts, standards and other ethical tools that could  be useful to public officials in resolving these issues.  The  research tasks are conceptual and empirical, involving further  review of the relevant literatures and development of a conceptual  framework, fieldwork on a set of hazard case studies which raise  significant ethical questions, and the preparation of casebook and  ethical guidelines.  The literature review will cull the hazards  and disaster literature and the applied ethics literature in order  to identify central ethical questions of use in developing a  framework of ethical concepts and cases of particular relevance for  the fieldwork portion of the study.  Case studies will collect and  compile background materials and conduct telephone and on-site  interviews.  The casebook will contain summaries of the case  studies, each focusing on ethical issues and ending with a set of  questions highlighting the ethical problems, and a set of  guidelines attempting to facilitate ethical judgment for hazards  management.  The book will be widely distributed.  ***",
