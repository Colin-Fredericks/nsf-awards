 "awd_abstract_narration": "9312138  Coleman  This proposal concerns heavy Fermion physics. Four projects will be  considered: 1) Development of an odd frequency pairing model for  heavy Fermion superconductivity. 2) A critical test for quadrupolar  ground-state doublets in uranium heavy Fermion compounds. 3)  Computation of the optical conductivity and dynamic susceptibility  of Kondo insulators within an Anderson lattice model. 4)  Development of a theory for anisotropic spin pairing to model the  hidden itinerant order in URu2Si2.  %%%  This proposal is concerned with the behavior of electrons which  behave, with regards to their transport in a material, as if they  have large masses. This field has a rich history but recent  discoveries have highlighted fundamental difficulties in our  present understanding. For example, two newly discovered heavy  Fermion materials - UPd2Al3 and UNi2Al3 - have large magnetic  moments and exhibit superconductivity from the same magnetic  degrees of freedom. This causes problems for the present theory of  such materials. Also, recent anomalies observed in such properties  as the specific heat in the heavy fermion material URu2Si2 suggest  that there is a \"hidden\" variable in the theoretical description of  the system. Work such as this is at the forefront of what is  considered state-of-the-art in contemporary condensed matter  theory.  ***",
