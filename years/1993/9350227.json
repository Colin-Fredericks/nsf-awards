 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350227  Goldstein  As a Presidential Faculty Fellow award, this proposal consists of  two parts. 1) The teaching plan involves the development of  interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate courses in nonlinear  dynamics and chaos, in hydrodynamics and pattern formation and in  the physics of biological and colloidal systems. 2) The research  plan involves seemingly diverse classes of problems ranging from  pattern formation to topological transitions to protein folding  with particular emphasis on their dynamical aspects. The PI  proposes to look for unifying concepts such as the role of  variational principles and conservation laws and for an  understanding of how energetics, kinetics and topological and  geometrical constraints are linked, in describing the dynamics of  patterns and shapes.  %%%  The PI proposes to start several undergraduate and graduate classes  at Princeton in the general area of chaos and unstable dynamics, of  pattern formation in liquid systems and of the physics of  biological systems. His research plan is to look for general  unifying principles governing the dynamics of how things - be they  coils of DNA or vortices in superconductors or fingers of one  liquid displacing another - change shape. His interest lies at the  heart of the competition between the driving force (energetics and  kinetics) to change shape and the constraints that geometry puts  upon that change.  ***",
