 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-dimensional electron gas in a generic potential and a                     transverse magnetic field exhibits very intriguing fractal spectra              with various crossings and avoided crossings in the band structure.             These crossings are characterized by integral topological                       invariants.  These features are key towards understanding some                  recent experiments in the organic conductors which exhibit cascades             of field-induced spin density waves and will have novel                         consequences in experiments involving quantum dot arrays.                                                                                                       In the incommensurate limit, a two-dimensional electron gas                     exhibits a cascade of metal-insulator transitions which at zero                 temperature has a \"devil's fork\" phase diagram.  A large class of               models will be studied to demonstrate that this fractal phase                   diagram is universal.  Some of the quantum chaos models will be                 examined and their experimental consequences will be explored.  In              addition, topological aspects of quantum chaos will be studied in               order to obtain a unified picture of a large class of systems with              competing periodicities.                                                                                                                                        A general formalism to study the finite temperature properties of               systems with competing lengths will be developed.  This method will             be applied to calculate thermodynamical properties of field-induced             spin density waves systems and the magnetic Fibonacci and other                 periodic superlattices.  A novel aspect of the Fibonacci lattices               is the power law behavior with modulations in the thermodynamic                 properties.                                                                     %%%                                                                             Theoretical research will be conducted on a variety of physical and             model systems which have competing periodicities.  This competition             between various natural periods of the systems results in highly                nonlinear behavior.  Special mathematical techniques need to be                 applied to understand the resulting behavior.  Physical systems to              be studied include the two-dimensional electron gas which forms at              semiconductor interfaces exposed to high magnetic fields, quantum               dot arrays, and magnetic waves induced in organic conductors.  The              chaotic limit will also be studied.  The results of this work will              yield generic techniques to handle these type of systems and will               assist in interpreting the behavior of these technologically                    important materials.",
