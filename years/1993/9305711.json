 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305711  Schulte  Variations in pressure and temperature are combined with time-  resolved Raman spectroscopy to study reaction parameters and  motions relevant for protein function.  The principal focus is on  two prototype processes:  ligand binding to myoglobin and light  energy transduction in the proton-pump bacteriorhodopsin.  The  protein is brought to a particular state of the Gibbs free energy  surface by changing pressure and temperature.  A sudden external  perturbation, for instance a pressure jump or a laser flash,  initiates a reaction or a relaxation.  Kinetic studies of  vibrational modes that change in position and intensity explore  the highly degenerate energy surface and relaxation phenomena.   In addition to monitoring Raman bands in the visible we use  excitation in the near-infrared to obtain Raman spectra in the  absence of undesired photochemistry and resonance enhancement.   These investigations provide new information on the arrangement  of the conformational energy surface in myoglobin and  bacteriorhodopsin, pressure effects on protein dynamics and on  the molecular structure of bacteriorhodopsin activation.  %%%  The dynamics structures which proteins maintain to perform  biological functions are distinguished by changes in energy and  volume from the unfolded polypeptide chain.  Site-selective  spectroscopic studies at variable temperature and pressure  provide insight into the relative energy scales of molecular  interactions in the stabilization of the biologically active  molecule.  Vibrational marker bands are used to monitor  structural changes and motions in myoglobin and bacteriorhodopsin  and correlate them with protein function.  Since proteins share  similarities in the thermodynamic, structural and dynamic  properties with many disordered systems such as glasses, new  insights from this research will have an impact on models for  disorder and complexity in other fields of science.  ***",
