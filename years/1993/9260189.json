 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tools and techniques for content-based organization and                    retrieval of electronic images from large databases will provide a              greatly needed relief from the ever growing among of visual                     information gathered by industries and individuals alike.  Current              applications of image information systems do not provide the                    functionality necessary to manage image data.  This requires                    mechanisms for determining semantic content of the data at storage              time, and representation in effective manner for retrieval.                          We propose to develop an interactive content-based image                   archiving system in which domain-specific knowledge is explicitly               represented separate from domain-independent knowledge.  This                   system will be used for creating image databases in different                   applications (e.g. animal specimens, art, flora, maps, industrial               parts, medical image, experimental results, etc.).  We propose to               employ a new layered data model which allows complex structural                 representations.  This model provides the user with the different               levels of interaction, and with the tools for generating semantic               entities from image portions, and for defining relation between                 entities as higher level constructs.  The development of such a                 tool will lead to a significant improvement in managing visual                  electronic information in particular and multi media information in             general.  In the first phase of our research, we will identify                  requirements of content-based image databases, study the                        suitability of current relational and object oriented databases,                and study a tasks domain, face database, for implementation.//",
