 "awd_abstract_narration": "The wing of Drosophila is a relatively simple but highly ordered                tissue. It contains a limited number of histologically identifiable             cell types arranged into a precise pattern of structures. The                   decision to form a particular cell type is made for the most part               during the latter stages of the growth of the wing imaginal disc                and Dr. Blair is examining the mechanisms underlying these events.              He here proposes to look at the problem of patterned formation of               wing veins. The specific aims are as follows: 1) To isolate and                 characterize cell-specific vein markers which will allow him to                 follow the process of vein formation in detail; screening known                 genes as well as new enhancer trap lines, has already led to the                isolation of markers which are specific for preveins, mature veins,             and the posterior cross vein, 2) To use these markers to follow the             effects of different classes of venation mutations during                       development. Newly developed techniques will allow an investigation             of the effects of both viable and embryonic lethal mutations and                future studies will also make use of techniques for the localized               over expression of genes. The purpose of these studies is to                    identify critical steps in the venation process and the genes                   required for each. Also addressed will be issues of cell autonomy               of such mutations and the roles played by genes during the cell-                cell interactions critical to the patterning process, 3) To                     initiate the genetic and molecular characterization of novel and                previously characterized vein-pattern genes, and 4) To perform                  surgical manipulations to the disc in order to better understand                the cell-cell interactions required for vein patterning.",
