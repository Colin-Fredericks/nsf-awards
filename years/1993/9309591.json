 "awd_abstract_narration": "9309591  Doyle       Computer-aided process operations management includes tasks  such as process monitoring, regulatory control, data  reconciliation, unit and plant-wide optimization, process fault  diagnosis, supervisory control, planning and scheduling.  Due to  the inter-dependencies of these tasks, operations management  involves coordination of these tasks in an integrated manner.  The  proliferation of disparate tools and techniques to carry out these  different tasks imposes barriers to problem integration by  fragmenting the system implementation and the solution process.   Dealing with integration requires a careful choice of problem-  solving paradigms, knowledge representation, search and reasoning  techniques so as not burden the individual tasks and at the same  time providing a unified framework.       In this research, the researchers will develop a new course  on computer integrated process operations that will address the  nature of these operational tasks, the character of integration,  the use of artificial intelligence, math programming and nonlinear  modeling techniques that are necessary and inevitable for achieving  this automation.  This course will bring state-of-the-art tools and  techniques and industrial case studies to the class room to educate  and prepare undergraduate and graduate students in current trends  in computer-integrated manufacturing in the chemical process  industries.",
