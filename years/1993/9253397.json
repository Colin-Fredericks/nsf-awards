 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future Scientists and Engineers of America (FSEA) is a                          structured after-school program to promote math and science                     through engineering applications among American youth, grades                   4 through 12.  FSEA has hands-on projects at increasing levels                  of complexity which provide student members with practical                      engineering applications of science and mathematics.  Students                  advance through categories similar to the Scouts based on                       Satisfactory completion of projects.  They enter as a                           technician and advance to levels of scientist and engineer.                                                                                                     Chapters are sponsored by businesses, professional societies                    and community organizations which provided mentors and funding                  for FSEA projects. Each Project is conducted by a team                          consisting of a volunteer teacher and a volunteer mentor.  A                    mentor must have a technical background in a scientific or                      engineering field.  Mentors can be volunteers recruited from                    industry, retired scientists and engineers or engineering                       students.                                                                                                                                                       In less than a year, mentors and teachers have attended start-                  up workshops and 24 chapters have been successfully organized.                                                                                                  Increasing demand for chapter development, with continuing                      emphasis on minority and female youth, has created the need                     for further development of projects kits, parent involvement                    and continuity among feeder schools.  The proposal intends to                   develop the procedures, structure and organization that would                   enable FSEA to develop an additional 35 chapters in Southern                    California and become a national after-school program and                       expand to other states.",
