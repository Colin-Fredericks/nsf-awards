 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kubichek         Developing effective automatic, or objective techniques for  assessing speech quality to replace human listener scores (i.e.,  subjective quality) has been the object of much research.   Current algorithms base quality estimates on input-to-output  distortion measures.  A related, yet almost unexplored problem,  is estimation of transmission quality using only received speech  without access to the transmitted speech record (Output-Based  Quality or OBQ).  A second problem is objectively measuring  intelligibility using only received speech (Output-Based  Intelligibility or OBI).  This research addresses both of these  difficult problems, and is based on recently developed  technologies that utilize models of hearing perception to provide  speaker-independent speech recognition.         OBQ and OBI estimates are being determined from carefully  designed distance measures between Perceptual Linear Prediction  (PLP) coefficients of output speech and cluster centroids derived  from training data.  A PLP analysis system is being implemented.   Methods for estimating OBQ and OBI estimates are being developed.   Finally, the algorithms are being tested on a variety of speech  databases.  Statistical analyses will characterize their  performance in terms of their correlation with subjective results  and robustness to speaker and distortion variation.",
