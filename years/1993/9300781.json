 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this research, the unique technique of differential ac free-                 standing film calorimetry is used to measure the heat capacity of               free-standing liquid crystal films and other liquid crystal                     mesophases.  This technique allows investigation of two-dimensional             physical phenomena without the complicating effects of a substrate.             Because of its extremely high resolution (better than 1 in                      100,000), it is possible to obtain high-quality heat capacity data              from the two-layer films, and acquire information on unexpected                 layer-by-layer transition sequence near the smectic-A-hexatic B                 transition of several liquid crystal compounds.  In addition, high-             resolution optical reflectivity experiments (better than 5 in                   10,0000) are coupled to the calorimetric measurements to allow                  simultaneous measurements of heat capacity and optical reflectivity             of various liquid films and other liquid crystal mesophases.  The               proposed work will enable one to test important theoretical                     predictions related to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-type transition in               two dimensions, and will provide new insights into the physics of               two-dimensional substrate-free systems.                                         %%%                                                                             A state of art differential ac calorimeter developed in this                    research is used to measure the heat capacity of free-standing                  liquid crystal films (similar to soap films on a ring) as thin as               two molecular layers.  This unique technique offers new                         opportunities to investigate several critical two-dimensional                   physical phenomena without the complicating effects of a substrate.",
