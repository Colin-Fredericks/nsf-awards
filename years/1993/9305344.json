Theoretical and pulsed nuclear magnetic  resonance investigations will be carried out on molecular hydrogen  and deuterium and rare gas atoms physisorbed as thin films on  magnesium oxide, boron nitride, and silicon.  These molecules and  atoms will also be studied as matrix-isolated species in non-  magnetic hosts and at high pressures in a cryogenic nuclear  magnetic resonance (NMR) diamond anvil cell.  Multiple spin echoes  unique to adsorbed species will be used to examine dynamics and  phase transitions at high densities and under restricted  dimensionality.  A closely related effort will examine hydrogen and  deuterium in amorphous semiconducting films under conditions where  light-induced metastable changes in the electronic properties of  the materials occur.  The theoretical effort will include first  principles molecular dynamics simulations on large supercells of  amorphous silicon containing various dopants.  %%%  This project will provide support for a joint theoretical and low  temperature experimental study of quantum solids and films and of  defects in materials.  Theoretical and pulsed nuclear magnetic  resonance investigations will be carried out on molecular hydrogen  and deuterium and rare gas atoms physisorbed as thin films on  magnesium oxide, boron nitride, and silicon.  These materials will  also be examined at high pressures.  The research involves  fundamental topics as well as technologically important subjects  related to defects in materials and the role these defects play in  determining materials properties.  For example, amorphous  semiconductors doped with various atoms will be investigated to  learn more about the properties of these materials which are used  in photoconducting solar cells.  The research should shed light on  the metastable properties of the photocells which at present li mit  their efficiency and practical utility.  ***",
