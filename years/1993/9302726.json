 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will involve research on a number of nonlinear                problems in solid mechanics.  These problems include: (1)                       dynamical problems of viscoelasticity and dissipation and shocks                (including one-dimensional problems for nonlinearly viscoelastic                bodies and self-sustained oscillations, Hopf bifurcations, and                  fluid-solid interactions); (2) asymptotics of light flexible                    bodies; (3) bifurcation problems of nonlinear elastoplasticity;                 (4) contact problems; (5) coexistence of phases in anisotropic                  media; and (6) other problems such as inverse bifurcation                       problems, nonlinear magnetoelasticity, and control problems.                    Each problem will be given an exact formulation (without ad hoc                 geometric simplifications) and each problem employs general                     constitutive equations satisfying the standard invariance                       conditions and mild physical restrictions.  The use of such                     constitutive equations illuminates the mathematical structure of                the governing equations and permits the detection of new effects                associated with material response.  The goals of the research are               to detect new phenomena, especially those associated with                       instabilities and the occurrence of thresholds, to treat concrete               problems that illuminate the general theories, and to develop                   analytic tools for the treatment of both general and specific                   problems.                                                                            A variety of dynamic and steady-state nonlinear problems for               rods, shells, and three-dimensional solid bodies will be studied.               The bodies are composed of nonlinearly elastic, viscoelastic,                   plastic, or magnetoelastic materials.  In each case, fully                      invariant, geometrically exact theories encompassing general                    nonlinear constitutive equations are to be used.  The goals of                  these studies are to discover new nonlinear effects, determine                  thresholds in constitutive equations separating qualitatively                   different responses, examine important kinds of instabilities,                  contribute to the theory of shocks and dissipative mechanisms in                solids, and develop new methods of nonlinear analysis for                       problems of solid mechanics.",
