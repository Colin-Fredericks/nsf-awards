 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrew Casson will continue to study the geometrization                    problem for 3-manifolds.  The recent solution of the Seifert Fiber              Space Conjecture has reduced this to the case of irreducible 3-                 manifolds whose fundamental groups contain no free Abelian                      subgroups of rank two.  Casson will concentrate on such manifolds               which have infinite fundamental group; according to the                         \"Geometrization Conjecture,\" these manifolds should all admit                   hyperbolic structures.  He will seek simplified proofs of                       Thurston's now classical results establishing this conjecture for               manifolds with non-trivial boundary, in the hope of developing                  methods which apply to the still unsolved case of manifolds without             boundary.  Robion Kirby will continue to search for topological                 interpretations of Witten's 3-manifold invariants for Sl(2,Z), and              particularly for the case of finite coverings.                                       It is a surprising fact that although we live in a three                   dimensional space, a so-called 3-manifold, and so are blessed with              a natural intuition about such geometric objects, in the end this               does not carry us as far as we might have expected, for questions               which have been settled by algebraic calculations for higher                    dimensional manifolds still remain baffling in the 3-dimensional                case.  The most famous of these is the celebrated conjecture of                 Poincare from around the turn of the century concerning 3-                      dimensional spheres, where precisely the original 3-dimensional                 case is the only one still open.  The investigators are pursuing a              variety of questions about 3-dimensional manifolds with slightly                strange notions of distance on them, so-called hyperbolic metrics,              but time and time again these questions have been shown to have                 clear relevance to the case of manifolds with a more familiar                   notion of distance.",
