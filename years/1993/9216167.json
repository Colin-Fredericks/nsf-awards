X-ray diffraction studies of long lived carbocation salts.                                                                                                2.    Reactions of hydrocarbons in the coordination sphere of                         soluble metal complexes.                                                                                                                                  3.    Structural coordination chemistry.                                                                                                                        4.    Structure analysis of metal hydrides and other compounds by                     x-ray and neutron diffraction.                                                                                                                            5.    Study of the relationships between structure, reactivity and                    energetics in organometallic complexes.                                                                                                                   6.    Synthetic organic, bioorganic and organometallic chemistry.               %%%                                                                             An x-ray diffractometer is an instrument used to measure the                    precise structure of a chemical compound, or molecule.  Distances               between the atoms in a molecule are measured to a precision of                  about 0.1 picometers (there are 1,000,000,000,000 picometers in one             meter; one meter is about three feet).  X-ray diffraction                       measurements also give precise information about the relative                   location and orientation of a given molecule to the other                       neighboring molecules in the single crystal.",
