 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between Cornell and Brown                       Universities.  We propose to study magma genesis and                            evolution in St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada through a                      multi-disciplinary approach that will include field work,                       petrographic study, major element, trace element, Sr, Nd, Pb                    and O isotope determination, and K-Ar dating.  Petrographic                     study will include both micro probe and laser-ablation-                         inductively-coupled-plasma-mass-spectrometry studies.  The                      immediate objectives of this study are to:  (1) determine                       the contribution of arc crust to the evolution of mantle-                       derived magmas in Grenada and St. Lucia, (2) use the most                       magnesian of these magmas, some of which are only slightly                      evolved since production in the mantle wedge, to investigate                    degree of melting and source enrichment, and (3) determine                      how magma composition has changed through time on these                         islands.  Achieving these objectives allows us to address                       several broader objectives.  These are:  enhanced                               understanding of (1) magma generation and evolution                             processes in island arcs, (2) tectonic evolution of the                         Caribbean region, (3) the conditions necessary for crustal                      assimilation to occur or not to occur, (4) mass transport                       from the subducting slab to island arc magmas, and (5) mass                     fluxes of incompatible elements to the deep mantle from                         subduction zones.  By focusing on a few localities with an                      improved experimental knowledge base, and having a wide                         range of data, we believe we can substantially improve                          earlier models.",
