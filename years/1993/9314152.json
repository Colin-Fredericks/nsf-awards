During the last decade, these universities have been under pressure to contribute to the Nation's economic development.  In particular, they have been asked to translate the results of new scientific advances into technologies that provide economic benefit.  This project is intended to examine the degree to which universities are making the shift in their research orientation and to identify the structural and environmental factors that are associated with, and affect, the accompanying cultural change.  If a basic shift in the university research climate is in progress, it will have some important implications for the nation's technology transfer strategy.  Such a shift implies that research universities may be better poised than is generally assumed to play a larger role in the development and deployment of technological innovations.  Equally important, the results of this study will add a new dimension of knowledge in a search for the ever evolving role of research universities in contemporary American society.  To test this cultural change and related hypotheses, the proposer intends to:  (1) survey a variety of respondents, including department chairs and members of their departments, research center and institute directors, vice presidents for research, and intel lectual property managers; and (2) conduct field interviews to develop case studies of five institutions that emerge from the survey phase as having shifted their research orientation notably more or notably less than others in the survey.  Fourteen independent variables will be studied, including regional differences, land grant status, academic disciplines, and amount of state research support.",
