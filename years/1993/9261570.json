 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is               in the area of theoretical and computational chemistry.  This                   research will explore the issues involved in parallelizing                      Gaussian 92, the most widely used electronic structure software                 package, using the Linda programming environment for workstation                networks and multiprocessors.  Since both Gaussian 92 and Linda                 emphasize portability across multiple computer architectures, this              project will offer chemists electronic structure modeling with the              power of parallel processing while retaining both the range of                  models offered by Gaussian and the choice of most cost-effective                platform for each user.  At some sites otherwise idle cycles on                 existing workstation local area networks (LANs) are expected to                 provide a major source of new and productive computing capacity                 which can be utilized as a result of this effort.  In order to                  achieve this, the key kernels of the algorithms in Gaussian for                 various models must be identified, and methods developed of                     parallelizing these computations while retaining their high                     efficiency on individual processors. The Phase I research will                  demonstrate the feasibility of using Linda on workstation networks              for this purpose on one critical type of model, Hartree-Fock                    (including gradients and second derivatives), identify the key                  kernels of the other models, and develop a strategy for                         parallelizing them as part of a Phase II effort.                                %%%                                                                             This Phase I project addresses the important questions of how                   Gaussian 92, the premier ab initio code which is used by                        industrial and academic researchers alike, can be run in a                      distributed network.  The research plan should establish proof of               concept for a product that is expected to be commercially                       important.",
