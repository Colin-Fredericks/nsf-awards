 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today, everything from computers, consumer electronics, to                 military equipment is driven by micro-chips, the first link in the              chain of technology for the microelectronic industry.  In order to              extend the flexibility and capacity of device and system design,                microelectronic packaging is becoming as important as silicon                   fabrication.  Among existing encapsulation methods, plastic                     packaging, which accounts for eighty percent of the market share,               will continue to play a major role in the growth of the                         microelectronic industry.  The performance reliability of plastic               packaging, greatly depends on the performance of the encapsulants               and manufacturing methods.  Traditionally, design and manufacturing             for microelectronic encapsulation with plastic packaging are                    conducted in an ad hoc manner based on experience and intuition,                which is costly and time consuming.                                                  The study is aimed at establishing the scientific basis and                attaining an engineering solution for characterizing the process.               It will employ experimental, analytical and computational efforts               to develop an efficient, reliable analysis tool.  The results of                the research will improve understanding of the process and                      facilitate simultaneous engineering by means of computer                        simulation.",
