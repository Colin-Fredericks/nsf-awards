 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lockwood  9311414    This project is a three island comparative study of the impact of market integration and capitalist incorporation on rural Tahitian women.  The islands, Tubai, Rurutu, and Raivavae differ in their degree of development and exhibit a range from minimal to advanced market integration.  Women on these islands play different socioeconomic roles and have different kinds of control over resources and income; subtle differences in gender ideology can also be identified.  The researcher predicts that these differences reflect the differential impact of capitalism.  By comparing women's roles and patterns of domestic relations (autonomy, decision-making, authority) and gender stratification (differential control of income/resources) on the three islands, the research will identify the key factors (both structural and ideological) linked to the course of change in rural Tahitian women' lives.  This research will contribute to our understanding of variability in the impact of capitalism on Third World women.  The research will be conducted by three anthropologist, each responsible for the major portion of research on each island.  Data collection includes a household socioeconomic census on each island and extensive structured interviews with male and female household heads.  Statistical analysis of the data will be conducted and specific hypotheses which relate various gender-based structural and ideological factors will be tested.  ***   s( t( of Commerce.
