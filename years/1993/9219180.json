 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies have demonstrated that 238U-206Pb isochrons                        derived from carbonate rocks yield dates consistent with                        depositional ages despite evidence of diagenesis in the host                    carbonates.  The spread of observed isotope ratios in                           carbonates is sufficient to give a potential age resolution                     of +  1 Ma for the Paleozoic; however, studies to date have                     achieved 2o error limits of no better than roughly + 10 Ma                      due to scatter about the isochron ('errorchron') beyond what                    is attributable to analytical error.  The aim of this study                     is to gain an understanding of the causes of this scatter by                    studying U-Pb systematics in pristine and near-pristine low-                    Mg calcite fossils from the Lower Jurassic and in a number                      of well-preserved marine and diagenetic carbonate phases                        from the Permian Reef Complex.  The importance of diagenesis                    and possible trace phases (Fe oxides, phosphate minerals,                       organic matter) will be assessed through the use of                             microsampling methods, partial leaching and, as applicable,                     the monitoring of a variety of isotopic and chemical                            tracers.  A better understanding of the processes that                          control l the initial variability of carbonate 238U/204Pb                       ratios and that subsequently alter U-Pb isotopic systems                        will lead to more reliable and precise carbonate 238U-206Pb                     and 207Pb-206Pb isochrons.  The direct dating of carbonates                     has immediate application to a number of problems in the                        earth sciences, including the calibration of the Phanerozoic                    time scale, the dating and correlation of Precambrian                           sediments, and the dating of diagenesis.",
