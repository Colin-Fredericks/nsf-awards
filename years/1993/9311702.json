 "awd_abstract_narration": "9311702  Weide  Zweben  Ogden  This research addresses the technical problems impeding the  development of software systems as assemblages of off-the-  shelf reusable components.  Substantial progress has been  made in defining component engineering principles and in  developing a collection of interoperable components.  Each  component is designed for maximal reusability and, before  inclusion in a component library, is subjected to quality  control procedures by which it is certified to have certain  properties:  correctness with respect to a formal  specification, freedom from storage leaks, an essential  level of efficiency, etc.  The purpose of a component's  certification is to give prospective clients critical  assurance that the component is truly suitable for reuse.    The primary goals of the work are to:         *    Identify specific properties for which local  certifiability is essential or advantageous to the process  of obtaining high-quality software systems from high-quality  components.         *    Determine and state precisely those  characteristics that a client program and the other  components it employs must possess, in order that locally  certified components can be guaranteed to behave as  advertised in that client's context.         *    Investigate specific techniques for the local  certification of various important properties of software.  ***",
