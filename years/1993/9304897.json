The ability of these systems to dissipate this energy when  subject to vibration is a key factor in the design of  earthquake-resistant systems.  Energy principle have  traditionally provided methods for the design of earthquake-  resistant structures, but for soil dynamics, the approach  has been to concentrate on stress-strain based formulations.  Thus, this project is motivated to examine the response of  soil structures to earthquake loading using energy  principles to quantify soil performance up to failure.    The objective of this research project is to identify and  develop the relationships between relevant energy  characteristics in monotonic and cyclic loading leading up  to failure and soil liquefaction, and to use the state  boundary surface as an energy envelope that provides a  unifying link between monotonic and cyclic loading.  As part  of this development, it is necessary to examine the question  of uniqueness of the state boundary surface.    The main objectives are:  1. Establish an energy envelope for monotonic soil behavior  and its relationship to the state boundary surface.  2. Investigate the hypothesis that liquefaction initiates  when the input energy level exceeds the dissipation energy  in cyclic loading.  3. Develop a framework to analyze soil failure due to  liquefaction, based on energy principles.    This is a collaborative research project involving  Washington State University and the Georgia Institute of  Technology.  ***",
