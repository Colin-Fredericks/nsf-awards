 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307513  Bauer    With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Brian Bauer  will continue his examination of the Incan system of \"ceques\" which  were described by the earliest Spanish missionaries. What these  documents indicate is a system of 41 or 42 hypothetical lines  (ceques) which radiated out from the capitol of Cuzco in highland  Peru. Religious shrines were situated at various points along these  lines. In past work Dr. Bauer has located some of these shrines on  the ground but many remain unknown. To complete this task, he and  Peruvian colleagues will first study archival documents which are  located in repositories in both Peru and Spain. They will then  conduct field survey to locate the places actually described. On  this basis it will be possible to reconstruct the ceque system and  how it functioned and then to situate it in real space.    Although this research may appear to concern an esoteric ritual  system, it in fact provides direct insight into how states  function. Lacking both writing and wheeled vehicles, the Inca  rulers created an empire which extended beyond the boundaries of  present day Peru and which integrated large numbers of people who  spoke diverse languages and lived in very different environments.  A question which interests archaeologists is how such a complex  system was maintained. Information available indicates that the  ceque system played a central role in this. Ceque lines marked  major boundaries between kin groups and the maintenance of  individual shrines was also based on kin and social ties. Thus the  ceque system may provide insight and a way to approach more basic  questions of social organization.     This research is important for several reasons. It will provide  data of interest to many archaeologists. It will also increase our  understanding of how complex societies develop and are maintained.  ***",
