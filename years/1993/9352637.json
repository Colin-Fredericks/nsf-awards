 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern equipment will substantially enhance the nature of                       undergraduate Astronomy observing labs at the introductory                      level. It is absolutely vital to update antiquated equipment so                 that Astronomy is not perceived as an old, drab science without                 innovation. The project centers on student use of modern light                  detectors (CCDs) and image processing techniques which closely                  match what the professional does. Much of the thrill,                           motivation and excitement of science comes from discovery. A                    variety of observational exercises, using this modern                           equipment, are oriented towards projects which emphasize the                    discovery aspects of Astronomy. To meet these objectives, a                     wide field imaging system is used so that a single CCD exposure                 images 1-4 square degrees of sky. With similar systems,                         students are able to image a wide variety of astronomical                       targets. These new labs represent an exciting addition to the                   traditional textbook curriculum. Such labs should increase the                  scientific and computer literacy of undergraduate and allow                     them to understand more effectively the coupling between                        instrumentation and computers, and motivate them to pursue a                    career in science by emphasizing the process of discovery and                   the relationship between data and scientific model making.",
