 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-range goals of this research are (1) to understand how DNA             precursor biosynthesis is regulated; (2) to understand how                      regulatory mechanisms affecting DNA precursor synthesis control the             rate and fidelity of DNA replication; (3) to understand the                     metabolic and genetic consequences of pertubations in DNA precursor             biosynthesis; and (4) to contribute toward an understanding of                  mechanisms of action of the enzymes involved.  The proposed                     research involves a multienzyme complex, formed in T4 phage-                    infected Escherichia coli, which carries out the synthesis of                   deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs).  This is the T4 dNTP                 synthetase complex.  The wealth of genetic and biochemical                      knowledge of T4 permits a variety of powerful approaches to                     understanding protein-protein interactions in this system.                      %%%                                                                             DNA replication uses precursors, the deoxyribonucleoside                        triphosphates, which are specialized for that purpose and for                   little else.  In addition to replication, dNTPs are used in DNA                 repair and in recombination; also, bacteria used dTTP in cell wall              synthesis.  This limited repertoire of metabolic role makes it                  possible for DNA synthesis to be regulated specifically at the                  level of precursor formation.  This research attempts to describe               how dNTP synthesis is controlled and the extend to which these                  mechanisms contribute toward the control of DNA replication.",
