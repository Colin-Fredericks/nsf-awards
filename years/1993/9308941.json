However, little is known about                 the antecedents of these individual differences across children.                This research will explore the contributions of the family in the               development of social competence with peers. Children and their                 families (both mothers and fathers) have been followed yearly                   since kindergarten and will be evaluated again when they are in                 grade 3, during the current grant period. The research will                     evaluate several aspects of this issue, namely: (1) the impact of               parent-child interaction on peer relationships, (2) the impact of               the parent as advisor and (3) the role of the parent as a                       provider of opportunities for contact with other children. A                    multimethod, longitudinal approach will be used involving self-                 report and observational measures in both naturalistic and                      laboratory contexts. The research will focus on emotional processes             including children's emotional understanding and cognitive                      representations of social relationships. Also to be examined is the             role of the social context, the neighborhood, in determining                    parental management activities and children's social behavior. The              research will permit us to identify (1) the changing role of the                three parental influence sources across time (2) the relative                   importance of these three sets of strategies as a function of                   children's social acceptance and (3) the cross time relationships               between changes in these strategies and changes in children's peer              acceptance. This research will help identify how families                       contribute to the development of children's social behavior with                their peers and suggest strategies for the modification of family               patterns that would, in turn, lead to improvements in children's                social competence.",
