Using a nationally normed exam and a critical review  of Senior Seminar performances, we have found that our students  frequently lack the ability to carefully design experiments and  critically analyze their results. This deficiency is most  conspicuous in areas of cellular and organismal physiology  where concepts of Chemistry and Physics need to be applied to  laboratory data in order to arrive at meaningful  interpretations. A developmental program, starting in the  Freshman year, was initiated in an attempt to address our  concerns. However, in order to continue our program in the  Sophomore and Junior level Physiology courses, new  instrumentation and data processing equipment is urgently  needed. To this end, we intend to install 7 computer  workstations in our Physiology lab. In conjunction with  physiological transducers, simulation software and data  analysis software, these workstations will provide an  integrated system for teaching experimental design, data  acquisition, and methods of critical data analysis. The new  equipment will also provide our students with the means for  studying electrophysiology (nerve and muscle tissues) and  pursuing more sophisticated research projects in the area of  physiology.",
