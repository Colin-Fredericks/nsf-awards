Feher of the Chemistry Department,  University of California at Irvine.  Three projects involving  metallasilsesquioxanes will be pursued.  The reactivity of  molybdenum, tungsten, and rhenium-containing silsesquioxanes as  olefin metathesis catalysts will be investigated, with  particular emphasis on determining the effect of varying the  M-O-Si bond angle.  The chemistry of platinum group metals in  highly siliceous environments will be compared to their  behavior in more traditional ligand environments.  New  surface-modified silicas and silica-supported catalysts will be  prepared to test the results of model studies in solution with  the chemistry of heterogeneous catalysts.  %%%  Because silica (sand) is an amorphous insoluble material, it is  difficult to study.  Incompletely-condensed clusters of silicon  and oxygen, called silsesquioxanes, are used here to mimic the  hydroxylated surfaces of silica.  In catalytic applications, in  which silica is used as a support material for metals,  reactions at the surface are important in the catalytic  activity.  An advantage of the silsesquioxanes is that they can  be dissolved in many common organic solvents, thus allowing  detailed studies using many of the powerful analytical  techniques used to study molecules in solution.  In this  project, reactions which model surface reactions of silica and  silica-supported catalysts will be carried out and the insights  obtained will be tested on new heterogeneous catalysts.  ***",
