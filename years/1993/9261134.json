This controller                                              is different from existing devices                                              in that clinical professionals will                                             be more able to adapt it to meet                                                the needs of end users with various                                             disabilities.  Existing devices are                                             often limiting and impose                                                       constraints on the types of                                                     input/output information they can                                               process.  As such, clinician often                                              have difficulty adapting the                                                    controllers to the end users and,                                               consequently, the users are                                                     provided with less-than-optimal                                                 systems.
