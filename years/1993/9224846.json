Lange of the University of                                         Colorado, Boulder, in collaboration with                                        Professor Oscar Fonseca of the University of                                    Costa Rica, Francisco Corrales of the National                                  Museum of Costa Rica and Lic. Rafael Gonzalez                                   Rivas of the National Museum of Nicaragua.  The                                 primary workshop will examine the data bases                                    for different parts of the Greater Nicoya                                       subarea and address broad issues such as                                        patterns of social organization, cultural                                       evolutionary continuity and other themes.  It                                   will provide a forum to the participants for                                    discussing the nature and status of the                                         cultures of the region and for coordinating                                     future research in the area.  The two secondary                                 workshops will provide diffusion of workshop                                    results among the larger professional                                           communities in each country.                                                                                                                                    This critically important region is lacking in                                  systematic studies with a regional focus.  The                                  workshop will define research priorities in                                     this area and explore the most efficient means                                  for meeting those needs.  The conference, which                                 will be hosted by the Governor of the Province                                  of Guanacaste, Costa Rica and receive some                                      support from the Nicaraguan Institute of                                        Culture, should further international                                           cooperation and advance collaborative research                                  between U.S. and Latin American Scientists.",
