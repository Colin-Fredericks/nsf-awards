 "awd_abstract_narration": "The introductory physics laboratory is the first opportunity                    for most college students to experience the basic elements of                   experimental science.  It is important that the experience be                   a positive and rewarding one.  Although most of our current                     experiments are interesting, and can teach important concepts,                  students frequently get bogged down in lengthy sessions of data                 taking and manipulation, activities which they correctly regard                 as \"archaic\" and \"boring.\"  This project (part of a 3-year                      effort by the Physics department to improve the teaching and                    equipment in introductory laboratories) seeks to introduce CCD                  cameras and 486-based PC computers into the lab, starting with                  four experiments from the fall semester. (1) Projectile Motion.                 Students get a strobed image of a bouncing superball, showing                   that the trajectory is a parabola and that the x and y motions                  are constant speed and constant acceleration, respectively.                     The CCD camera and PC make the (otherwise laborious) data                       reduction fast and fun. (2) Two Dimensional Collisions.  Pucks                  collide on an air table and strobed pictures are analyzed to                    investigate conservation of linear momentum.  Currently,                        students spend 1 to 2 hours getting a picture (Polaroid) and                    analyzing the data.  A CCD/PC system gets a picture in seconds                  and offers a number of optional studies to the student --                       elastic vs. inelastic, energy conservation, center of mass                      motion, varying mass.  (3) Kinetic Motion (a new experiment).                   A 2-dimensional \"gas\" of pucks on an air table is excited by                    shaking walls.  Students can measure the mean free path or                      speed distribution.  (4) An optional experiment measures the                    motions of Jupiter's moons.  The goal of this proposal is to                    begin to move the introductory lab away from step-by-step                       procedures which lead to an encircled number, toward a lab                      where students, using modern sensors and computers, can have                    options to explore concepts and try their own ideas.  The                       project is made feasible by the low costs of highly capable CCD                 camera systems and 486-based personal computers.",
