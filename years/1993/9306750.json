 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preliminary evidence indicates that the Drosophila Structure                    Binding Protein 1 (sbp1) gene is an excellent candidate for                     involvement in DNA recombination, replication, and/or repair.  The              spb1 gene is a single copy gene producing three different                       transcripts that are enriched in tissues and life stages involved               in rapid cell division.  The SPB1:beta-galatosidase fusion protein              preferentially binds three-stranded DNA structures in a sequence                independent manner, and appears to possess a strand displacement                activity. The protein predicted from the nucleic acid sequence of               sbp1 cDNAs shares some sequences similarity with prokaryotic DNA                ligases.                                                                        The primary objective of this proposal is to define, at single-                 nucleotide resolution, the specific binding determinant present in              three-stranded DNA structures that is preferentially recognized and             bound by SBP1.  This will be accomplished by first chemically                   probing isolated structures to model the three dimensional                      structure of the DNA.  Regions that are accessible to the probe are             predicted to be either single stranded or distorted double stranded             regions in DNA.  Subsequently, the relative binding affinity of                 SBP1 for modified versions of the preferred binding substrate will              be assayed.  Modifications resulting in a reduction or elimination              of binding will indicate the importance of a determinant for SPB1               binding.                                                                        %%%                                                                             Recombination, or crossing over, is the event in which blocks of                genes are exchanged between chromosomes during meiosis.  The                    process involves breakage of two DNA helices and the subsequent                 exchange.  It is generally accepted that unusual DNA structures are             formed during recombination.  This proposal is directed toward                  understanding how these unusual DNA structures are recognized and               resolved.",
