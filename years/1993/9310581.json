Muscle is thought to produce the stimulus for sprouting.  This project seeks to identify the molecular nature of that stimulus.  The following working hypotheses will be tested:  (1) sprouting is regulated directly by ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) released from denervated or paralyzed muscle; and (2) sprouting is regulated by a soluble component of the CNTF receptor released from denervated or paralyzed muscle.  The assumptions of the model are that CNTF from a nonmuscle source is continuously available to motor neuron terminals, that the amount of  CNTF available is not sufficient to induce sprouting, and that when CNTF is presented as a complex with a soluble component of the CNTF receptor, its activity is potentiated and reaches the threshold for inducing terminal sprouting.  Dr. Gurney will test the two working hypotheses by using a combination of molecular and biological assays to determine the effects of CNTF and CNTFR components on sprouting.  In addition, monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies will be used to inhibit the biological activity of endogenous CNTF or soluble components of the CNTFR.  The most interesting implications of this study are that the motor neuron growth factor is not a entity and that different growth factors may regulate programmed cell death, synapse elimination, and regeneration or sprouting. ***",
