 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the participation of 16 U.S. scientists                in a U.S.-Japan Photoconversion/Photosynthesis Seminar on                       Molecular Photophysics of Organized Assemblies.  The seminar,                   which will be held March 14-18, 1993 in Palm Springs, California                is being co-organized by Professor Pill-Soon Song, Department of                Chemistry, University of Nebraska, and Dr. Iwao Yamazaki,                       Department of Chemical Process Engineering, Hokkaido University,                Sapporo, Japan.  The seminar will focus on new aspects of                       research in the biophotophysics of photoconversion/                             photosynthesis, the biological relevance of newly acquired                      information on the structure and dynamics of the excited states                 of biomolecules and their assemblies (both artificial and                       biological systems), and the current understanding of the                       molecular mechanisms of light energy conversion and signal                      transduction (both signal generation and amplification) in living               organisms.  Seminar sessions are organized around the following                 topics:  photophysics of molecular assemblies, photosynthetic                   systems:  primary photoprocesses and electron transfer, magnetic                effects and organized molecular magnetism, photoconversion and                  photo-signal transduction, and photon energy capture and                        transfer.  The goal of the seminar is to provide opportunities                  for in-depth discussion, which could lead to further research                   collaboration between U.S. and Japanese scientists.",
