 "awd_abstract_narration": "Estep proposes to analyze and implement adaptive finite element               methods for systems of singularly-perturbed reaction-diffusion                  equations and dissipative ordinary differential equations.                      Solutions of such problems typically evolve on multiple scales,                 and to be useful, numerical results need to be uniformly accurate               for the physically meaningful range of the parameters. He is                    attempting to overcome these difficulties by constructing a                     theory of adaptive error control based on a posteriori and a                    priori error analyses. A posteriori results measure the error in                terms of the regularity of the approximation and the stability of               the solution and provide a basis for adapting the discretization.               A priori results bound the error in terms of the regularity of                  the solution and the stability of the scheme and guarantee                      convergence. Estep is also examining the dynamical properties of                numerical schemes in the context of producing approximations with               the correct dynamical behavior. Finally, he is studying the                     implementation of adaptive error control in finite element codes                for parallel computers. The ultimate goal of this project is the                public release of a parallel code that can solve systems of                     reaction-diffusion equations in two and three dimensions with                   minimal user interface.                                                            Many models in applied science result in nonlinear                           reaction-diffusion differential equations that contain source                   terms balanced against terms that diffuse energy. This balance is               usually delicate and difficult to handle mathematically,                        consequently numerical approximation is an important tool. Yet,                 solutions of such problems typically evolve on several scales,                  i.e. some interesting behavior occurs in very localized regions                 in space-time while other behavior evolves over long times and                  over larger regions in space. The use of a uniform numerical                    discretization for a real application results in huge                           computations that tax even the largest computers. Estep's goal is               to produce numerical schemes that adapt themselves to the                       localized behavior of the target solution so as to make the                     computations both as accurate as desired and as efficient as                    possible. Mathematically, he is trying to understand how to use                 the information provided by an approximation to adapt the                       discretization, that is, make the computations self-governing. He               is also working on the implementation of this theory into a                     parallel code that solves very general problems with minimum user               input. Success of this project will lead to the public release of               the code, to the great benefit of the engineering and scientific                communities.",
