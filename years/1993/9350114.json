 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Bennett's research project involves two distinct area:                      nonlinear optics in optical fibers and optical properties of thin               polymer films.  In the first project, the nature of fibers which                have been conditioned to produce second harmonic generation (SHG)               will be investigated.  In particular, she will obtain a spatially-              resolved map of the built-in electric field along the length of                 fibers conditioned for SHG.  It is expected that the effects of                 surface charges will have to be very carefully controlled and                   analyzed.  The second project involves developing interferometric               techniques to measure thermally-induced changes in thin polymer                 films, both in real time and in situ.  Specifically, Dr. Bennett                will distinguish between the separate contributions of thermal                  expansion and refractive index change to the variation in optical               thickness of thin films as the temperature and/or relative humidity             in their environment changes.  Dr. Bennett has had extensive                    experience in the measurement of surface characteristics and thin               film properties.                                                                                                                                                Interactive activities at the host institution include:                         interacting with women in physics at the five colleges in western               Massachusetts by teaching a Physics Laboratory at Mount Holyoke                 College, teaching a short course on surface characterization during             the winter quarter, and lecturing at all five colleges on topics of             interest to students in Dr. Bennett's areas of expertise.  She also             plans to update the experiments in the optics laboratory and                    develop new experiments for an advanced optics laboratory at Mount              Holyoke College.                                                                                                                                                This project furthers VPW program objectives which are (1) to                   provide opportunities for women to advance their careers in                     engineering and in the disciplines of science supported by NSF and              (2) to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering             by providing greater visibility for women scientists and engineers              employed in industry government, and academic institutions.  By                 encouraging the participation of women in science, it is a valuable             investment in the Nation's future scientific vitality.",
