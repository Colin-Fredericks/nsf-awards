 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310171  Croat and Zhu       Graduate student Zhu under the supervision of Dr. Croat is  undertaking a taxonomic study of tropical aroids of the genus  Dracontium, of which there are an estimated 20 species in the New  World tropics.  Materials for study include preserved herbarium  specimens borrowed from various national and international museums  and supplemented with new field collections to be made in Costa  Rica, Venezuela, and Ecuador with the help of host country  colleagues.  New features of morphology and anatomy including  pollen and chromosomes are being analyzed, to acquire reliable  characters for taxonomic discrimination and for construction of a  stable classification of the species.  Field observations on  pollination will help understand the differences in floral form  among the species.  %%%       Numerous groups of tropical plants are poorly known, often  from single or few collections made decades ago by various natural  history expeditions.  This doctoral thesis project will focus on  the New World species of a group of tuberous aroids related to  philodendrons and anthuriums, and will result in greatly increased  collections available for morphological and biochemical studies, as  well as improved methods of species recognition, a more stable  classification, and the first analysis of phylogenetic  relationships among these species and with putatively related  genera.",
