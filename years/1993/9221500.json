The small   meeting will be held in Vienna, Austria, in July 1993.  It is co-organized by a   group of  U.S. and Austrian engineers, principally Drs. F. E. Udwadia of USC   and Hans Troger of the Technical University of Vienna.   Approximately one-  third of the participants are engineers at early stages of their research careers.    Special effort was taken to involve experts from Russia and Eastern Europe,   since there is substantial activity there in this field.  The purposes of the   meeting are to familiarize these participating representatives of the  pan-  European and American research communities with each other's work, and to   promote collaboration among them in future research.    The subject of this workshop has significant implications for manufacturing   systems.  Rapid development of technology requires increased precision and   robustness in mathematical modelling of the relevant phenomena.  This   requires going beyond the methods of Classical Control Theory and advancing   the frontiers of Analytic and Qualitative Nonlinear Dynamics in Control.    Effective design and control of modern dynamical systems, such as robotic   manipulators, demand models that recognize their full non linearity and allow   for the influence of bounded uncertainty.  A formalism developed by the   Russian Liapunov offers just that.  There is a very strong Eastern European   network of researchers building on his work.  They had very little contact with   the West until very recently, so this meeting will accelerate the diffusion of   their valuable research in Western Europe and the U.S.  ***",
