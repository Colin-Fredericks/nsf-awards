In order to maintain this status, it is  imperative that Princeton's chemical engineering  research facilities be modernized.  This ARI award  provides funds to renovate and modernize the  chemical engineering research facilities located in  the A-wing of the Engineering Quadrangle and the G-  wing of the Energy Research Laboratory.  Present  conditions within the laboratories are ill-suited  for modern computational and experimental research.   Renovations to these facilities will improve  services to insure proper electrical supply,  chilled and deionized water, high pressure  nitrogen, compressed air and ventilation.  With the  refurbishment of obsolete research laboratories,  efforts in the fields or ceramic processing,  complex fluids catalysis and surface science,  nonlinear dynamics, and polymer science and  materials will significantly expand the  Department;s influence in the field.       Renovated facilities will sustain the momentum   acquired by the Chemical Engineering department  over the past decade through major senior  appointments and the development and promotion of  outstanding junior faculty.  The department's  influence on the profession through its leadership  in the field, collaborations with industrial  laboratories, and producing studnets who continue  to pursue advance degrees will strengthen with  modern facilities.  ***",
