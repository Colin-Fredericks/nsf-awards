 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past three years, we have been developing and offering                  an innovative course, \"Discovering Physics,\" for non- science                   majors. We are now broadening the approach we have been taking,                 which includes elements of the \"discovery technique and the                     small-group \"complex instruction\" learning environment, to both                 the elementary/middle school level and the standard college                     science-major physics sequence. The original course is being                    expanded to two semesters, and is being aimed especially at                     students planning to go into precollege teaching; active                        participation of current teachers is also being emphasized, as                  an important part of the developing partnership between the                     University and the Worcester Public Schools. The course will                    retain its stress on understanding nature through direct                        experience and the concepts which grow out of careful                           consideration of these experiences; we are continuing to                        encourage students to ask \"How do we know...?\" and \"Why do we                   believe...?\" questions about physical phenomena. Our program                    welcomes, and has been successful with both male and female                     students and students from groups traditionally under-                          represented in science. To promote a broad, national impact,                    are producing a \"discovery workbook,\" a teacher's manual, and                   associated software. An outstanding group of consultants is                     working with us in the various aspects of this project.",
