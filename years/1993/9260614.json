 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave sintering of ceramic materials provides an exciting                   alternative to conventional sintering processes.  Typically,                    microwave sintering offers efficient and rapid thermal heating of               ceramic materials that absorb microwave radiations.  However,                   microwave sintering has its challenges, which include a poor                    understanding of microwave - materials interactions, unstable                   heating resulting in a thermal runaway, and localized melting.  A               new method has been proposed under this program which addresses                 many of these challenges.  This method is especially well suited                for complex ceramic oxide systems that are difficult to process by              microwave radiation.  A suitable transient - lossy - phase will be              selected that will absorb microwave radiation promoting a reaction              with other phases to form a complex oxide system that has low                   dielectric loss, thus limiting further microwave adsorption.  Such              self limiting or \"smart\" microwave processing can be used to solve              many problems associated with microwave sintering.                                                                                                              \"Smart\" microwave processing will yield materials with highly                   reproducible properties.  This process will allow rapid processing              of ceramic materials.  This research work will also provide a                   significant dielectric properties database which will be useful for             academic research as well as industrial applications.",
