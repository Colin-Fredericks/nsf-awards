 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will assess and investigate the determinants of 1970-                1990 trends in occupational sex and race segregation, and trends in             the sex and race composition of specific occupations.  The                      investigators have already created occupational-level data files                aggregated from individual-level 1970 and 1980 census microdata.                This project will create a similar file for 1990 that will permit               three-wave pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis.  The unit               of analysis is the detailed occupation.  The dependent variables                are changing proportions of various race-sex groups (e.g. black                 women) across the more than 500 detailed occupations.  The                      independent variables measure occupational growth, attractiveness,              white male labor supply, the ability of their customary workers to              exclude outsiders, their economic pressures to lower costs,                     economic advantages to hiring nontraditional workers, and                       vulnerability to legal sanctions.                                                                                                                               The research will contribute to several fields of sociology,                    including occupations, stratification, mobility, gender and race                relations.  In so doing, it will strengthen the knowledge base for              policy decisions concerning equal employment regulations and                    concerning the diversity of the future American labor force.",
