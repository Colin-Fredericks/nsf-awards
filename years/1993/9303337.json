Travel awards will be             provided through the SCOR Secretariat to attend meetings that                   relate to SCOR activities.  This program provides an effective                  mechanism for establishing contacts between oceanographers from                 developed and developing nations.  Project objectives include:                  broadening traditional participation in ocean-related international             scientific meetings to include more scientists from developing                  countries; to enhance the exchange of detailed regional knowledge               or expertise in planning for large-scale oceanographic experiments;             and to provide greater opportunities leading to the involvement of              developing countries in international collaborative programs, such              as JGOFS and GLOBEC.",
