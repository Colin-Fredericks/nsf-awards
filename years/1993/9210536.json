People in some cultures, more than other cultures,                   emphasize group interests more than individual interests.  This                 has implications for the way people resolve disputes and                        negotiate, especially between and within groups and                             organizations.  This research studies negotiation and mediation                 behavior in the USA and Netherlands, where past work shows that                 the individual is more important, and India and Hong Kong, where                the group is more important.  Procedures that identify subjects                 who emphasize groups interests above individual interests will be               used in each of these sites in equivalent negotiation and                       mediation experiments.  These experiments will test hypotheses                  derived from negotiation and mediation theory.  Among the issues                to be examined are the effects of negotiating between versus                    within groups, group representation, and the effects of                         attributes of constituents on negotiation by the group                          representatives.  In the experiments, subjects will interact in                 simulated negotiation and mediation sessions.  A record of their                interaction will be coded.  Outcome measures include negotiation                and mediation tactics, negotiator offers, concession rare,                      mediator recommendations, and the quality of the negotiated                     agreements.  The results of this research are important for                     understanding how negotiators and mediators function in different               cultures.  We will also learn how people in negotiations across                 settings (e.g., business, environmental, political) can be                      trained to improve their negotiation effectiveness.",
