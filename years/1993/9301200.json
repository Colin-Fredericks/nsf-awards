 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research lies within the area of optimal                     stochastic control. It deals with optimal control of diffusion                  processes by means of a free boundary, as well as optimal control               at a reflection boundary of the stochastic process. This type of                control naturally appears in problems in which there is no                      natural restriction on the rates of control and the optimal                     control rate id infinite. The optimal policy is then to reflect                 the process from the a priori unknown boundary. Such type of                    action arises in problems with additive control, where there are                no a priori limits on the control rates. It is intended to                      develop of the related partial differential equations with                      gradient constraints, to study optimal reflection barriers in                   multi-dimensional cases and to investigate other problems                       pertinent to singular control in queuing, inventory and flexible                manufacturing models.                                                                The proposed research lies within the area of optimal                      stochastic control. This type of control problem arises in models               involving automatic cruise control of an airplane subject to                    uncertain wind conditions, of a space vehicle subject to small                  perturbations in mechanical units. The solution to this problem                 suggests the optimal timing of the correction of the course of                  the airplane of the space vehicle. Singular control also appears                in queuing/production/manufacturing models. In a typical model of               a flexible manufacturing system one seeks the optimal scheduling                of turning on and off the production unit, the timing of buying                 new equipment or increasing the capacity of the existing unit,                  finding optimal levels of inventory stocked for supply, etc. In                 many cases when the production process faces uncertainties due to               fluctuation of demand or due to unreliability in the process                    itself, it is possible to use the theory of singular control to                 address the questions posed above.",
