 "awd_abstract_narration": "Furman University has installed a TCP/IP network that links                the equipment in the major academic and administrative buildings on             campus.  It requests support from NSF for connection of this campus             network to SURAnet.  SURAnet is the midlevel network located in the             southeastern United States.  It will provide operations management              and information services and it give Furman University a 56                     thousand bits per second connection to the NSFNET, a high speed                 (1.5 - 45 million bits per second) National Backbone network.                        The University needs greater functionality and network speed               to be able to access supercomputers, libraries, and make file                   transfers along with being able to collaborate with peers at other              schools on common projects.  Students and faculty research will                 benefit from the link.  This is also a unique opportunity for the               school to explore innovative educational resources.",
