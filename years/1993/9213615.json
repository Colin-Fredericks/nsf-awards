 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the past six years this research team has been testing                a model for estimating the size of uncontrollable populations                   (populations like victims of rape, or people who are HIV-sero-                  positive, or homeless people).  The model has shown promise but                 has also shown some clear shortcomings, as a result of having                   almost no theory regarding the rules governing social networks -                that is, the rules governing who people know and what they know                 about one another.  The investigator's program of research will                 a) illuminate those rules and b) improve model for estimating the               size of uncountable populations.  Two studies are planned.  The                 first study addresses the question:  How difficult is it to know                various things about other people?  Given, for example, that it                 is easier to know the occupation of those identified in a network               than it is to know their blood type, how can this difference be                 measured, and what conditions of \"knowing\" one another does this                difficulty depend on?  The second study addresses the question:                 How many people do we know well enough to know their occupation                 or blood type - or a host of other kinds of information?  The                   importance of the topic area is very great, both for fundamental                research and for applied and policy purposes.",
