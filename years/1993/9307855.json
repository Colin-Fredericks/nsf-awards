 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research will be conducted in three related areas:                         Self-Affine Sets and Expanding Maps; Probability on Discrete                    Groups; and Thermodynamic Formalism.  The ultimate goal is to                   contribute to the understanding of statistical behavior in                      nonconformal expansive and hyperbolic dynamical systems,                        especially as it relates to the \"fractal\" geometry of repellers.                The more immediate aim is to elucidate the structure of                         self-affine sets,e.g., the relationship between Hausdorff and                   Bouligand dimensions and the natural dynamical systems associated               with such sets.  For this a better understanding of random matrix               products, especially their large deviations, seems essential. The               study of random matrix products, in turn, leads to questions                    concerning random walks on nonabelian groups and the theory of                  Gibbs measures and thermodynamic formalism: in particular, a                    significant component of the research effort will be directed to                producing accurate approximations to the transition probabilities               of random walks on discrete groups and semigroups, and developing               a theory of Ruelle-like operators appropriate for this purpose.                      Investigations into the behavior of certain chaotic                        dynamical systems will be conducted, in particular, those in                    which the phase space is stretched at different rates in                        different directions.  Unusual geometric objects that arise in                  the \"phase spaces\" of these dynamical systems, called                           \"repellers,\" and their connections with the nature of the                       dynamics will be closely studied.  The theory of probability                    predominates in these investigations: questions involving the                   behavior of \"typical\" orbits are studied by choosing an initial                 state of the system \"at random.\" This viewpoint leads to related                problems in probability theory proper, mostly concerned with                    certain features of random walks on state spaces with a highly                  noneuclidean geometry (\"matrix groups\").",
