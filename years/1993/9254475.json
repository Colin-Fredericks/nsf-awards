 "awd_abstract_narration": "Materials are being developed to support teacher education                      activities at project sites in Georgia, western New York, Michigan              and other sites throughout the country as well.  The units focus on             selected content and processes emphasized in the NCTM Standards.                Their development is informed by research on the teaching and                   learning of mathematics.  Leadership Seminars that feature the                  units will be held for individuals involved in  working with                    secondary teachers in a variety of contexts.  Seminar participants              will implement the units into their teacher education programs,                 analyze the effectiveness of their use, and offer suggestions on                how the units might be further refined.  Leadership Seminars will               be open to state and local teacher educators and to teacher                     educators associated with various statewide systemic initiatives or             statewide teacher collaborative projects.  An inservice program                 that features the units will be held for teachers who supervise                 student teachers in an effort to better articulate preservice and               inservice programs.  The project's teacher education activities                 will provide a rich context for conducting research on teacher's                knowledge and beliefs about the content and processes in the units,             about ways teacher educators implement the units and the role                   required of them in doing so, and the nature of teachers'                       experiences as they leave their preservice program and begin their              careers as mathematics teachers.",
