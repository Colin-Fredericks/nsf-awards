 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although polyhalogenated aromatic compounds are major                           environmental pollutants, little is known about the enzymes                     involved in the biodegradation or detoxification of these                       compounds.  We propose to use the degradation of                                2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by Pseudomonas                      cepacia AC1100 as a model for the biodegradation of                             polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.  We propose to identify,                    purify, and characterize enzymes involved in 2,4,5-T degradation.               After one of the enzymes is purified, a partial amino acid                      sequence will be determined.  Finally, the structural gene for                  the protein will be cloned using DNA probes constructed with                    amino acid sequence data about the enzyme, and characterized.                   The results from our work and additional genetic information                    about 2,4,5-T degradation from Chakrabarty's group will together                form an important contribution to our understanding about                       microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.                    %%%                                                                             Polyhalogenated aromatic compounds are major environmental                      pollutants; however, little is known about the biochemistry of                  microbial degradation of such compounds.  In order to use                       biological approaches to remove these compounds from our                        environment, it is necessary to understand the biochemistry of                  microbial degradation of these compounds.  We proposed to use the               degradation of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) by                   Pseudomonas cepacia as a model system to study the biochemistry                 of microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic compounds.                 We will identify and isolate enzymes involved in 2,4,5-T                        degradation and clone the corresponding genes encoding the                      enzymes.  The results from this work will provide fundamental                   information on microbial degradation of polyhalogenated aromatic                compounds.",
