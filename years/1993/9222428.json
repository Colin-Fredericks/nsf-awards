 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an in situ and short traverse seismic                       reflection/refraction and magnetotelluric experiment in West                    Antarctica.  This collaborative experiment involves four awards at              four institutions.  The four-fold purpose is 1) to investigate part             of the Byrd Subglacial Basin, 2) to test techniques for this work               that could be done in a long traverse, 3) to determine the                      viability of the magnetotelluric method on a thick (electrically                resistive) ice sheet, and 4) to evaluate the relative merits of                 refraction with wide reflection versus reflection with narrow                   refraction seismic studies in imaging the lithosphere.  The                     geophysical techniques that will be employed are capable of imaging             the ice sheet, the continental lithosphere, and the upper mantle,               as well as determining physical properties of parts of the                      lithosphere and mantle.  Investigations of outcrop geology over the             last thirty years in West Antarctica and the Transantarctic                     Mountains have lead to recent interpretations that the crust is                 made up of many different lithospheric blocks.  Seismic reflection              work is the only way to image the crust in detail and the                       refraction work is the only way to determine physical properties of             the layers and blocks defined by the reflection work.  The                      magnetotelluric work is scientifically risky because it may not                 yield useful information when used over the electrically resistive              ice sheet; however, if it works it has the potential to image                   molten rock in the crust and upper mantle.  In a continental rift               region such as West Antarctica, the presence of melt in the                     lithosphere is likely and, if documented, has very important                    ramifications to ice sheet dynamics.  Research work supported by                this award is expected to provide constraints to models of a range              of crustal processes from models of ice sheet dynamics to tectonic              and kinematic models of lithospheric thinning and rifting.",
