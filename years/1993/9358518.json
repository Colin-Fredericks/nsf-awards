Results from the fields of educational psychology and cognitive  science will be integrated and developed into a cohesive framework  for teaching/learning which will be motivationally-based, student  centered, and vectored towards structured experiential learning for  the development of engineering judgment.  The role of spatial and  functional visualization in scientific creativity will be  investigated.  New knowledge structures and methods will be  developed to cope with the intrinsic characteristics of engineering  design as well as for the accomplishment of the goal of innovation.  ***",
