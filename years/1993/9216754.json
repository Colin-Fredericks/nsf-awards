 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project in the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry                     Program of the Division of Chemistry involves two distinct but                  related advances in computational quantum chemistry.  The first                 is the extension, testing, and calibration of a                                 configuration-interaction method based on natural orbitals.                     The second is the application of the theoretical methods to                     answer a number of important molecular structural questions.                    The systems being studied include the ammonia dimer, triatomic                  halogen radicals, circulenes (hydrocarbons with seven hexagons                  surrounding a heptagon), and the cyclocarbinyl cation.                          %%%                                                                             Modern high-speed computers can be used to calculate the shapes                 and energies of molecules, including those which have not as                    yet been synthesized.  In this study not only are the computer                  methods for carrying out these calculations being advanced, but                 they are also being applied to the study of exotic molecules                    such as that formed by three chlorine atoms rather than by two                  atoms as in the more familiar chlorine molecule.",
