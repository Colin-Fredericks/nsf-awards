 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of insecure               ownership or property rights on the use of natural resources in                 the developing world.  One cause of ownership insecurity is                     volatile political and legal regimes.  Several empirical studies                will be undertaken to explore the relationships between measures                of political volatility and natural resource development and                    extraction.  Models are developed to identify the effect of                     insecure ownership on incentives to develop resources, on                       investment in extraction capital, and on the timing of resource                 recovery.  The empirical studies will focus on the pattern of                   deforestation that results from commercial logging, the incentive               to invest in plantation forests, the mix of commercial products                 obtained from forests, the extent of fossil fuel exploration in                 developing countries, and the rate at which fossil fuel resources               are extracted.  Data on the stability of political institutions,                across countries and over time, are used to indicate ownership                  security.  In addition, the effect of ownership insecurity on the               frequency and structure of transactions involving natural and                   environmental assets will also be analyzed.  The transactions to                be studied are debt-for-resource swaps and contracts involving                  exploration and development rights for fossil fuels.",
