The focus  of the research will be on molecular processes in non-Newtonian  fluids. Solution organization will be used to model the  ordered, yet dynamical environment created by protein and  nucleic acid structures. The dynamic pockets formed in these  solutions will provide many of the features present in  enzymatic catalysis such as local concentration of reactants  and conformational \"pressure\". The magnitude of these effects  can be monitored by NMR and varied by modifying physical  conditions such as spin rate and sample tube size. Molecular  recognition and catalysis will also be studied in non-Newtonian  solutions.  %%%  Non-Newtonian fluids are widespread in nature including blood,  the interior of globular proteins and protoplasm. These  typically aqueous polymer solutions vary their viscosity as a  function of the applied stress. This research will address the  fundamental nature of biological and synthetic polymers under  non-Newtonian conditions.  ***",
