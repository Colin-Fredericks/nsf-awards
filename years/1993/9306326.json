 "awd_abstract_narration": "A methodology is proposed for deriving equations of motion for interfaces in  transition between two phases, such as the solidification of a liquid into a  solid, in the asymptotic limit of small diffusion. The investigator will show  that the velocity of the interface is a function of its local geometry, described  by so-called intrinsic quantities such as the curvature.  This model allows the  computation of the radius at which a growing spherical particle becomes unstable  and may allow a deeper understanding of the complex dendritic structures seen in  solidification.  The problem of the solidification of a liquid has many industrial applications,  such as the growing of a quartz crystal from a melt for use in semiconductor  devices like computer chips.  For these applications it is desirable to grow  smooth, regular crystals. Unfortunately, many substances tend to grow into  irregular  snowflake-like dendrites.  In this study the investigator proposes a methodology  for reducing the complex equations governing solidification to a relatively  simple geometric description.  This reduction should allow the prediction of the  transition from regular to dendritic solidification.  It may also give some   insight into the process by which irregular dendritic structures form and grow.",
