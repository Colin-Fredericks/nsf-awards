 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this investigation is to explore the immune system               of the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, and the                molecular mechanisms of coelomocyte activation.  The profilin gene              (SpCoel1), cloned from coelomocytes, is upregulated in cells                    responding to injury or to injections of foreign coelomic fluid.                This molecular parameter denotes changes that occur during                      activation of coelomocytes and will be used to assess the magnitude             of responses shown by the sea urchin immune system to experimental              challenge.  We will identify stimuli that are most effective in                 maximizing the transcription rate of SpCoel1 and in activating                  coelomocytes.  This analysis will indicate the recognition                      capabilities of the coelomocytes, and suggest the range of ligands              these cells can detect.  To further analyze the response to                     external stimuli, coelomocyte proliferation, including the time                 course of the appearance of new cells in the coelomic fluid, and                the location of the proliferative centers in the animal will be                 characterized.  Coelomocyte activation most likely involves the                 appearance of a number of new transcript species that are required              for defense functions.  Differences in the transcript population in             activated cells compared to resting cells will be used to clone and             characterize activation related genes.  To provide a molecular                  understanding, the regulatory region of SpCoel1 will be analyzed by             comparing protein-DNA binding patterns that regulate expression in              activated and resting coelomocytes, and in early developmental                  stages when this gene is also expressed in cells that may be                    coelomocyte precursors.                                                         %%%                                                                             The echinoderm immune system responds quickly and efficiently in                protecting sea urchins from infection and repairing injuries.  It               is a non-specific system, the effector cells of which are the                   coelomocytes found within the body cavities.  Although this system              appears primitive compared to the mammalian immune system, it may               be functionally homologous to important elements of higher                      vertebrate immune systems.  Primary cellular responses in                       vertebrates that underlie adaptive immunity are mediated by cell                types that also function in a non-specific manner, so the                       echinoderm defense system may not have changed much from the basic,             ancestral form.  Gene expression and the regulation of gene                     expression in invertebrate immune systems is an almost unexplored               area of biology.  Initial results of research on sea urchins have               identified a critical gene that is activated in early stages of a               defense response.  Further studies of how this gene is regulated                and how the gene-product functions in immune-cell activation will               shed new light on the cellular mechanisms of non-specific immune                function and how these ecologically important organisms defend                  themselves from injury or infection.",
