 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polya trees are a class of probability models intermediate                 between the more specific Dirichlet processes and the more                      general tailfree distributions.  The proposed research project                  will investigate whether Polya trees provide workable solutions                 in some problems where Dirichlet processes are unsatisfactory.                  The hope is that the generality of Polya trees can be used to                   create models that reflect prior and posterior opinions more                    accurately while avoiding the computational complexity of the                   full class of tailfree distributions.  The proposed research                    concentrates in four areas:                                                       1. Modelling opinions of smoothness, monotonicity and                         unimodality through the joint distributions of the components of                the Polya tree,                                                                   2. Modelling predictive distributions through mixtures of Polya               trees,                                                                            3. Assessing the robustness of parametric models by exploring                 nonparametric models concentrating around parametric ones;                      assessing the consistency of the nonparametric models and                         4. Generalizing the Dirichlet process to yield more flexible                  priors for the sizes of the point masses in the random                          distribution.                                                                        A constant problem in statistics is constructing                           mathematical models for real world phenomena.  To be useful the                 models must be sufficiently sophisticated to represent essential                features of the phenomena accurately but must also be                           computationally tractable.  The proposed research project                       investigates a class of models called \"Polya trees\" that                        generalize the well known, tractable, but somewhat limited class                of models called \"Dirichlet processes.\"  The hope is that Polya                 trees can represent real world phenomena more accurately than                   Dirichlet processes while remaining tractable.  The work will                   proceed partly through theoretical calculation, partly through                  computer simulation and partly through examples of Polya trees                  applied to real data.",
