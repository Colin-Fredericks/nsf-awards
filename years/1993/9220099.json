 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compounds derived from mevalonic acid are required for growth of                plant and animal cells.  In plants, the mevalonic acid pathway                  participates in the synthesis of cytokinins, abscisic acid,                     gibberellins, ubiquinones, plastoquinones, dolichols, sterols,                  carotenoids, chlorophylls, and numerous other isoprenoids.                      However, it is not clear whether these small isoprenoids fully                  account for the mevalonic acid growth requirement of plant cells.               In mammalian and yeast cells, it has been shown that products of                mevalonic acid are covalently bound to G-proteins, low molecular                weight ras-like GTP-binding proteins and nuclear lamins.  Covalent              attachment of isoprenoids to these proteins is required for their               assembly into membranes and, hence, for their role in signal                    transduction and cell growth control.  Given the recent discovery               of G-proteins and ras-like GTP-binding proteins in plants, it was               predicted that plants also contain isoprenylated proteins.                      Preliminary data shown in this proposal indicate that plants                    contain isoprenylated, membrane-associated proteins similar in mass             to ras-like GTP-binding proteins and nuclear lamins.  The goals of              this project are to determine the structure of the isoprenoid                   modification of these proteins and to identify the proteins.  This              work will lead to and understanding of the role of protein                      isoprenylation in plant cell growth, phytohormone action, signal                transduction, and membrane biogenesis.                                          %%%                                                                             Isoprenoids belong to a specialized class of lipid molecules.  In               animal cells, many proteins have been shown to be linked to                     isoprenoids.  These proteins participate in cell division and other             cellular processes. Current evidence suggests that the                          isoprenoid modification is essential for the biological activity of             these proteins.  This proposal presents the first evidence that                 plant cells also contain isoprenylated proteins.  The goals of this             project are to determine the chemical nature of the isoprenoids                 that are linked to plant proteins and to identify the respective                proteins.  This work will lead to an understanding of how the                   isoprenoid modification of proteins affects plant growth and                    development.",
