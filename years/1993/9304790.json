 "awd_abstract_narration": "9304790  Roux  Immune complexes will be generated by reaction of monoclonal  antibodies representing the various human and mouse Ig classes and  subclasses with specific antibodies directed against topologically  defined determinants.  Extensive use will be made of previously  investigated systems in which mapped idiotypic and isotypic  determinants will serve as probe sites.  molecules with altered or  mutant hinge regions will be similarly complexed for comparison.   Electron micrographic images will be scored for angular  relationships and rotational orientations between the various Fab  and Fc segments of target and probe molecules.  These data will be  interpreted in the context of the location of the reactive sites  and the class and subclass (i.e., the degree and modes of hinge  flexibility) of the reactants.  When reaction mixtures are sampled  at defined time intervals, a kinetic profile of the formation of  immune complexes can also be documented.  The goals are:  1) To  conduct a comprehensive comparative structural analyses of (a)  uncomplexed, and (b) tethered Ig classes and subclasses by EM with  emphasis on hinge-imparted flexibility of Fab and Fc arms.  2)  To  determine the correlation of idiotopes or isotypic determinants to  (a) the geometry and (b) the kinetics of immune complex formation  as a result of interaction with ligands.  3) To determine the role  of specific hinge structures (or other flexibility-imparting  segments) of native Ig in the generation of defined immune complex  configurations.  4) To determine the effect of genetically  engineered alterations of the hinge regions on the formation and  geometry of immune complexes.  %%%  A detailed understanding of the structural and functional aspects  of antibodies is of fundamental importance to a wide range of  immunological phenomena.  One key element that is rarely defined in  an antigen-antibody interaction is the relationship between the  geometry of the immune complex and its functional attributes.  This  pro posal describes a series of investigations aimed at studying the  three-dimensional geometry of immune complexes as a function of  both segmental flexibility and the location of reactive sites  (i.e., idiotopes and isotypic determinants).  Additional knowledge  on the limitations of Ig flexibility and geometry should enhance  the conceptual framework in which many basic observations are  interpreted.  Such information may also have practical applications  such as aiding in the development of rational approaches to the  design of Ig-based pharmaceuticals.  ***",
