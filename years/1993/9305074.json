 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305074  Salz      How the sex of Drosophila melanogaster is determined is as well  understood as is sex determination in any organism. However, even  in this system how such determination is regulated remains a  mystery. We are concentrating on the identification and  characterization of genes required for the maintenance of the  ON/OFF activity state of the binary switch gene Sex-lethal (Sxl).  Maintenance of Sxl is regulated by \"exon-skipping\", a type of  alternative RNA splicing. Only in females does the processed  transcription product yield a functional protein. We are focusing  on the analysis of snf, a sex determination gene which is utilized  to establish the female-specific splicing pattern of Slx. We have  recently found that snf has homology to the mammalian snRNP  proteins U1A and U2B\", suggesting that the snf gene product is an  integral component of the machinery required for splice site  choice. We will 1) continue our molecular characterization of the  snf locus 2) determine if the SNF protein is nuclear and/or  cytoplasmic as well as whether it is associated with nascent  transcripts on polytene chromosomes 3) determine whether the extant  mutations are simple loss of function mutations or have aberrant  functions by localizing the molecular lesions associated with the  extant snf mutations and examine the phenotypic consequences of  multiple copies of the mutant gene 4) determine whether snf is  likely to be an essential general-splicing factor, an essential  sex-specific splicing factor or an non-essential \"facilitator\" of  splicing, by generating and characterizing a small deficiency of  the locus 5)determine whether the human U1A protein and/or the  human U2B\" protein is functionally equivalent to snf by expressing  the human genes in Drosophila and determine whether either can  complement snf mutations 6) determine whether the differences  between the RNA Recognition motifs (RRM) of U1A. U2B\" and SNF are  functionally significant. These structure/function studies should  b e particularly informative in light of the extensive in vitro  structure/function studies that have been carried out on the human  U1A and U2B\" proteins.  %%%  By identifying and characterizing both general and sex-specific  genes required for maintenance of Sxl activity, we will gain  insights into the mechanism regulating sex-specific splicing.  Moreover, our analysis will have broader implications for the  understanding of the mechanisms regulating RNA splicing in general  since little is known about how splice site choices are made.  ***",
