 "awd_abstract_narration": "9220855  Varaiya  The electric power industry is being significantly restructured  in order to improve performance by reducing capital expenditures  through better equipment utilization, by reducing fuel cost  through better inter-firm coordination, and by offering  differentiated services that better match customer needs.  The  realization of these performance gains will require a vastly  expanded capability to monitor and control the entire power  network.  It is proposed to design and implement a laboratory-  scale Distribution  Network Management System (DNMS).  Logically,  the DNMS will be organized into three layers:the communication  facility which permits management stations to exchange monitoring  and control information will remote physical elements such as  distribution capacitors and customer meters; the application  facility which permits implementation of algorithms for  particular functions such as adjusting capacitors to minimize  losses; and the interpretation facility which hides from the  other facilities the heterogeneity of the physical elements.  The  DNMS system will be designed and tested on simulators of the bulk  power and distribution systems.  The research will build a recent  work on distribution automation and power utility communication  architecture, and on recent work on telecommunications network  management.  ***",
