 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"new institutionalism\" is one of the most promising theoretical             developments in social science.  It ranges across disciplines such              as political science, economics, legal theory, and sociology.  The              early years of political science (from 1900 through the 1940s) were             marked by an almost exclusive study of formal institutions such as              legislatures, executives, the bureaucracy, and international                    organizations.  The study of politics was highly legalistic.  From              the 1950s through the 1970s political science shifted gears toward              the study of individual behavior.  A useful corrective came since               the late 1970s when, prodded by economics, political science                    returned to the study of institutions.  This \"new institutionalism\"             went beyond legalisms to study how institutions arose and to                    encompass not only formal structures, but also ideas, value                     systems, norms, and culture.                                                                                                                                    The \"new institutionalism\" is hardly of one piece.  Some of its                 adherents believe that formal structures matter most, others that               informal institutions such as ideas and values are equally                      important.  Some institutionalists use an economic approach,                    seeking to explain how people manage to cooperate when there are                many incentives for them not to do so.  Others abjure this way of               thinking, focusing instead on how history shapes policy outcomes.                                                                                               In this research conference the investigators bring advocates of                these many perspectives together.  The objective is to determine                the contours of the \"new institutionalism,\" to seek out areas of                agreement, and to set out clearly what disagreements remain.  The               investigators have broken down the conference into five key areas               of concern to political scientists and other social scientists:                 international regimes; property rights; the state; constitutional               design and democracy; and, organizational theory.  The researchers              will also have papers and panels presenting overviews of the field              and research agendas for the future.                                                                                                                            The conference organizers will publish the papers and remarks and               disseminate them widely.",
