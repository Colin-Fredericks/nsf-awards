A major part of the work will utilize a                                                                                                  recently-developed pressurized flow reactor test facility.                      The                                                                             experiments to be conducted will provide resolution of                          mechanistic details (and the effects of pressure on these)                      associated with alkylperoxy radical reactions and definition                    of                                                                              the role of diperoxy radicals as branching agents.  Other                       separate complementary bench-scale experiments will also be                     utilized to elucidate mechanistic details controlling the                       oxidation of straight and branched hydrocarbons in the low and                                                                                                  intermediate temperature regimes.  Gas chromatography, GC/MS,                   and GC/FTIR diagnostics will be used for chemical analysis of                   stable reaction intermediates and products, while in-situ                       measurements of stable and radical species will be carried out                                                                                                  using FTIR spectroscopy.  Specific objectives are: (1) Obtain                   kinetic information for oxidation of pure hydrocarbons between                                                                                                  550 and 1000K at pressures up to 20 atmospheres; (2) Determine                                                                                                  effects of pressure on oxidation mechanism(s) in each                           temperature regime and how pressure affects boundaries                          separating the regimes; and, (3) Suggest and refine mechanisms                                                                                                  for modeling the alkylperoxy radical reaction system and the                    diperoxy radical reaction system.                                                                                                                               Hydrocarbon oxidation chemistry at low to intermediate                          temperatures (below 1000K) plays a significant role in                          operation of many combustion devices, notably internal                          combustion engines, in some cases accounting for a significant                  fraction of the                                                                 overall heat release as well as strongly affecting input                        boundary conditions for the higher temperature regions in                       these                                                                           devices.  Since such devices operate at elevated pressures,                     fundamental research on low and intermediate temperature                        hydrocarbon oxidation at pressures well above atmospheric is                    important to furthering the understanding of many practical                     internal combustion engine phenomena, including engine knock,                   preignition fuel decomposition, pollutant formation, and                        general autoignition processes.",
