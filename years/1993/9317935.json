 "awd_abstract_narration": "9317935  Callahan    The ocean technologies have significant economic and scientific  impact on our nation.  A planning grant to the University of Rhode  Island (EEC-9222523) has helped generate sufficient industrial  support to meet the criteria required to form an  Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Ocean  Technologies.    The Center's research agenda will focus on environmental monitoring  systems, equipment testing and acoustics and ocean mapping.      The Principal Investigator and colleagues are internationally  recognized scientists who have the resources and capability to run  this Center.    This Center has been coordinated with Norman Caplan, Program  Manager, Ocean Engineering Systems, Division of Biological and  Critical Systems at NSF.    Additional funding is provided by the U.S. Department of Navy to  augment ongoing research and to obtain a membership in the Center.    The Program Manager recommends the University of Rhode Island be  awarded $50,000 for the first year of a five-year continuing award.    An additional $25,000 is recommended for one year with funds  provided by the U.S. Department of Navy.    Near the end of each 12-month period, the Program Manager and/or  the Division Director of the Engineering Education Centers Division  will review the progress of the Center on a number of renewal  criteria requirements, including the following:  1) the extent to  which the university/industry interaction is developing; 2) the  extent to which the support base is developing and 3) the extent to  which a robust research program is developing.  If the review is  satisfactory, the Program Manager will recommend support for the  next period of this continuing award.",
