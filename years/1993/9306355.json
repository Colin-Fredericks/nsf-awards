 "awd_abstract_narration": "9306355  Jones  The goals of this proposal are to understand how the activities of the  aleurone, starchy endosperm and scutellum of germinating cereal grains  are integrated.  The mobilization of the starchy endosperm of cereal  grains, a tissue that consists entirely of dead storage cells, will be  studied, and a simple model in which pH plays a key role in the  regulation of endosperm mobilization will be tested.  This model is based  on the observation that low pH is essential for the synthesis and  secretion of hydrolytic enzymes by the aleurone and scutellum, for the  activity of these enzymes in the endosperm, and for the uptake of sugars  and amino acids produced by the activity of secreted hydrolases.   Experiments are proposed that have been designed to test the hypothesis  that acidification of the endosperm is brought about by proton pumps  located at the plasma membrane (PM) of aleurone and scutellum cells.  The  capacity of the aleurone and scutellum to acidify the external medium  will be evaluated by incubating these tissues in unbuffered and buffered  media in the presence of gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA).   Acidification of the incubation medium will be monitored using pH  electrodes and by titration.  The mechanism of acidification of the  endosperm by aleurone and scutellum will be examined.  Since the PM of  barley aleurone does not possess detectable levels of a P-type ATPase,  the possibility that acidification is brought about by a V-type ATPase at  the PM will be tested.  Specific inhibitor of V-type ATPases will be used  to examine acidification in vivo, and H+ transport by PM vesicles  isolated from aleurone and scutellum by phase partitioning will be used  to study the process in vitro.  Acidification by isolated aleurone layers  occurs rapidly after addition of GA, an observation that indicates that  H+ transporters are constitutively expressed in this tissue.  Specific  cDNA and antibody probes will be used to measure PM H+ATPase RNA and  protein l evels in aleurone and scutellum, and experiments will be carried  out to establish whether GA and ABA regulate the expression of genes for  these transporters.  Because the scutellum contains endogenous GAs, the  role of GA in regulating acidification in this tissue will be examined in  GA deficient mutants of barley.  Since aleurone cells secrete large  amounts of H+, they must possess a mechanism for maintaining charge  balance.  The possibility that charge balance in aleurone and scutellum  cells is achieved by the synthesis and export of organic and inorganic  anions will be explored using high performance liquid chromatography of  incubation media.  Since one of the goals of this proposal is to  understand the role played by H+ in coordinating the activities of  germinating grain, 31P NMR spectroscopy will be used to monitor pH  changes in the endosperm of intact germinating grain.  The hypothesis  that endosperm pH plays a key role in regulating endosperm mobilization  will be tested using NMR to monitor pH in grain exposed to stresses known  to inhibit germination or seedling growth or exposed to applied ABA and  GA.  If endosperm pH proves to be a reliable and early indicator of the  response of the cereal grain to stress, a simple test for measuring this  parameter will be devised.  The successful completion of this research  will contribute to fundamental knowledge about physiological processes in  plants as well as well as provide information of a practical nature to  growers of cereal crops.  ***",
