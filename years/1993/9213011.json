 "awd_abstract_narration": "A bacterial flagellum is driven at its base by a rotary motor                comprising a rod and set of rings embedded in the cell wall and                 cytoplasmic membrane.  The energy for rotation is supplied by an                electrochemical proton gradient.  The motor spins alternately                   clockwise and counterclockwise, with a bias depending on sensory                transduction, for example, on the cell's response to chemical                   stimuli (chemotaxis).  Studies of the biochemistry and physiology               of this system are being made with Escherichia coli and a motile                Streptococcus.  E. Coli is being used because the structure of its              motors can be perturbed genetically; Streptococcus is being used                because its motors can be energize artificially.  Measurements have             been made, either with swimming cells or with cells tethered to                 glass by a flagellum, of protonmotive force, proton flux, torque                and speed.  Mutants of the torque-generating elements MotA and MotB             have been isolated and characterized.  This work has led to a model             for the motor consistent with existing experimental data that is                being subjected to further test.  The goal is an understanding of               flagellar rotation at the molecular level, or more broadly, of how              living things use chemical energy to do mechanical work.                        %%%                                                                             Motility is a critical phenomenon of living things.  In the world               of bacteria, flagellum-mediated swimming movement allows for                    responses to chemical or physical stimuli (such as nutrients,                   light, barriers) which are necessary for alleviating colonial                   overcrowding, sustenance of individual bacteria, and genetic                    mating.  The bacterial flagellum and its motor are tiny, yet                    effective.  In addition to providing an understanding of the                    molecular basis for biological behavior, the results of this                    research could find usefulness in nanofabrication or biomaterials               research (e.g., using natural or artificial flagella as switches).",
