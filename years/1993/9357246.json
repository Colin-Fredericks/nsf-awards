A particularly striking series of  morphogenetic movements occurs during gastrulation, when massive  tissue movements and cell migrations transform the early embryo  from a hollow ball or disc to a three-layered embryo possessing all  of the basic structures of the emerging organism.  Because the  movements of gastrulation are so complex and dramatic, we have  turned to a seemingly simple system, the sea urchin embryo, in  order to discover general rules that all embryos use during  gastrulation.  In particular, we want to answer the following  questions: (1) What motile behavior(s) underlie epithelial cell  rearrangement during gastrulation, and how are such behaviors  coordinated to produce invaginations? (2) How do such  rearrangements rely on attachments of epithelial cells to the  apical extracellular matrix, or apical lamina, and to the basal  lamina?  In order to answer these questions, our laboratory is  seeking to use novel approaches to unite classical techniques,  computer-enhanced imaging, and molecular biology.  In particular,  we will use computer-assisted videomicroscopy and low-level  fluorescence imaging to study the motility of cells as they  rearrange during gastrulation.  Using the imaging techniques as an  analysis tool, we will use blocking antibodies and competitive  peptides, either expressed from cDNA clones or synthesized  directly, to examine the effects of perturbing the attachment of  cells to the extracellular matrix on motility in rearranging  epithelia.  In addition, we will use the technique of chromophore-  assisted laser inactivation of protein function (CALI) to perturb  these attachments at a highly local level to examine very specific  regions of interest during gastrulation.    As an embryo develops, the fairly featureless fertilized egg must  be transformed into an animal with a  recognizable body plan and  many highly organized structures.  This NSF Young Investigator  Award supports studies on the forces that shape embryos.  In  particular, we are interested in gastrulation, when cells move in  dramatic ways to reshape the embryo, producing the basic body plan  of the animal.  We are studying a simple system, the sea urchin  embryo, with the hope that by understanding this simple organism,  we will eventually understand much more complex one.   ***",
