 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major goal of studies in primate behavior has been to                         understand the causes of competitive relationships among females.               Historically, attempts to explain variation in competitive                      relationships have focused on what has been called \"contest                     competition,\" which can lead to dominance hierarchies, a major                  organizing theme in describing female relationships.  However,                  field studies have now shown that greater variation in female                   relationships exists than is accommodated or recognized by models               of contest competition alone.  Also, predictions of day range                   size from competition models have proved inadequate to date.                                                                                                    This project will focus on the complementary relationship of                    contest competition and \"scramble\" competition, which has not                   been so widely examined in the past.  It has been widely accepted               that intragroup competition increases as group size increases.                  One result of this increased competition is that in many primate                species larger groups travel farther per day than smaller groups.               However, not all species respond to increases in group size by                  traveling longer daily distances.  In fact, primates can be                     separated clearly by whether they do or do not increase their day               ranges with increasing group size.  This division also separates                clearly along the strength of the dominance hierarchy within                    groups (a form of contest competition).                                                                                                                         Isbell argues that in those species that increase day range                     length with increasing group size, dominance hierarchies among                  females within groups are strong and easily detected.  In                       contrast, in those species that do not increase day range length                with increasing group size, dominance hierarchies are weak or                   difficult to detect.                                                                                                                                            This study promises to clarify some fundamental issues regarding                behavioral expressions of competition in social groups of                       primates.",
