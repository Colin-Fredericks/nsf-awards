 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Peter Schmidt, Mr Christopher Clement                will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct an             archaeological study of historic plantations located in the                     Courland River Valley of Tobago. Because very little recent                     development has taken place on this island, early historic                      structures remain relatively visible and intact; thus the selection             of this research location. The project includes three stages. First             Mr. Clement will conduct broad scale survey to locate plantations               and determine how they were distributed over the landscape.                     Secondly he will map their internal layout to examine the                       arrangement of slave, manufacturing and overseer arrangements.                  Finally he will survey and make surface collections from the slave              living areas.                                                                                                                                                   While much is known about the organization of cotton plantations in             the U.S. South, adaptations to sugar cane production are not well               understood. Because sugar cane must be processed quickly it is                  likely that the spatial arrangements and internal social dynamics               were different in such situations. New World slavery, because it                brought together very distinct cultural groups and placed them into             very specific and varying contexts provides an excellent basis to               study culture contact and change. Mr. Clement's project will                    contribute to this goal.                                                                                                                                        This grant will produce information of interest not only to                     historians but also to a broad range of anthropologists. In                     addition, it will assist in the training of a promising young                   scientist.",
