 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California at Santa Barbara is developing a                   facility for computer based laboratory instruction in                           experimental psychology.  Each work station has ancillary                       hardware which enables it to be used in specialized                             experimental exercises. The primary courses improved by this                    project are in upper level laboratory courses in the area of                    psychology known as Human Information Processing. Research in                   Human Information Processing is concerned with how humans                       perceive, learn, remember, and think about information. The                     three laboratory courses have the same general structure.                       Students work together in small groups to conduct a series of                   psychological experiments. As the course progresses, students                   take progressively more responsibility for the design of their                  experiments. The course concludes with students conducting an                   extended experimental project of their own design. Each of the                  three courses is focusing on a separate content area: one on                    memory, learning, and reasoning, one on attention and                           performance, and one on perception and psychophysics. In                        addition to teaching general laboratory techniques, a goal of                   these courses is to introduce students to the use of computers                  in modern research and data analysis. The ability to use                        computers to organize and analyze information is a necessary                    skill for many of today's professional jobs; therefore, it is                   an important part of the teaching mission of a university to                    acquaint students with the techniques available on personal                     workstations. For students who go in science, these courses are                 teaching students how to use of computers for data acquisition                  and analysis.",
