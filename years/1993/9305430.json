 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this research is the study of computational  and constructive aspects of orthogonal polynomials.  Special  attention is to be given to the development and analysis of  constructive methods for generating orthogonal polynomials of  Sobolev type, i.e., polynomials that are orthogonal with respect  to an inner product involving derivatives.  These have originally  been introduced to approximate functions and their derivative  simultaneously, and have since received a considerable amount of  attention but largely from approximation-theoretic and algebraic  points of view and with little regard to computational aspects.  Other topics to be considered involve the question of computing  polynomials orthogonal relative to a Hermite weight on a finite  interval and the analysis of the remainder terms of special  quadrature rules.   Orthogonal polynomials are basic tools of approximation.  They  provide orthogonal expansions and least square approximations to  functions and contribute to a variety of quadrature processes. In  addition they are used extensively in the numerical solution of  ordinary differential equations and in the application of  iterative methods for solving systems of linear algebraic  equations.",
