 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning grant research will extend a study done in the                    investigator's University of Chicago 1989 dissertation.  That                   dissertation examined the impact of differing market structures on              the price adjustment behavior of commercial banks.  The major                   findings of that dissertation were: (1) a major proportion of the               differences in pricing rigidity (or behavior) was not explained by              differences in market structure, and (2) intramarket variation in               the price rigidity patterns of individual firms was very                        significant.  This latter finding motivated a search for a theory               to explain intramarket, or firm specific, price adjustment                      behavior, and led to a consideration of the \"New Keynesian\"                     economics literature on imperfect competition and costly price                  adjustment.                                                                                                                                                     Most of this existing literature has focussed exclusively on                    \"market\" characteristics to explain differences in price rigidity               patterns.  This project will focus on \"firm\" characteristics as the             relevant variable in analyzing the price adjustment behavior of                 firms.  This extension from market to firm specific analysis is                 very important in understanding and identifying the causes of                   sticky prices.  As such, it is also crucial for developing a                    complete analysis of the economy-wide misallocation of resources                imposed by wage and price rigidities.                                                                                                                           Specifically, the award will be used to: (1) review the price                   rigidity literature, (2) develop testable hypotheses about firm                 specific costs of price adjustment, and (3) begin developing                    tractable empirical models to test these hypotheses.  These models              will focus on commercial banks and their role as financial                      intermediaries.  However, the results will have implications for                other industries, and the economy as a whole.",
