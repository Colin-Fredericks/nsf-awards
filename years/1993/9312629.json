This activity will bring together highly regarded                               experts representing a number of fields in pure                                 mathematics and mathematical physics with the                                   overall objective of building international                                     networks between African scientists and their                                   U.S. counterparts.  This project supports the                                   participation of approximately seven U.S. and                                   nine African scientists. Conference participants                                will present papers that will be compiled and                                   published as a conference volume.
