 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-density materials exhibiting high strength and an ability                   to hold up under highly strenuous conditions of stress,                         temperature, pressure, etc. are needed in many high-                            temperature aerospace and energy applications.  Fiber-                          reinforced ceramic matrix composites are materials that                         satisfy the requirements of low density and acceptable                          toughness because fiber reinforcement usually leads to                          strengthening of the homogeneous isotropic material that forms                  the matrix of the composite.  Chemical vapor infiltration                       (CVI) is a method that can be used to fabricate ceramic matrix                  composites without damaging the preform of fibers or whiskers                   used for reinforcement.  During this process the gaseous                        reactants, or the products of their decomposition in the gas                    phase that surrounds the fibrous preform, are transported                       through the pores and form a ceramic matrix throughout the                      preform by chemical vapor deposition (CVD).  CVI leads to                       products of very good mechanical properties, can produce                        objects of complex shape and large size, and can be used for                    many ceramic-ceramic composites including oxides and                            nonoxides.  In addition to composite fabrications, CVI can be                   used to partially densify membranes made from ceramic or other                  materials and in this way produce selectively permeable                         membranes for special applications (such as separations).                                                                                                       Theoretical and experimental work is planned to study the                       fundamentals of the interaction of transport processes (heat                    and mass), reaction, and structure evolution during                             densification of porous preforms by CVI.  The deposition of                     silicon carbide from methyltrichlorosilane will be used as the                  model system in these studies.  The experimental work will                      include deposition experiments using porous and nonporous                       substrates, film and pore structure characterization, and mass                  transport coefficient measurements.  The deposition                             experiments will be carried out in a hot-wall reactor,                          operating in a gravimetric arrangement, while structure                         characterization will be carried out using microscopy, Raman,                   XRD, electron microprobe, gas adsorption and mercury                            porosimetry.  Theoretical work will involve the development of                  models that summarize the relative importance of the various                    factors that occur during CVI.  In addition to contributing to                  the elucidation of the fundamentals of CVI, this project will                   also generate information for any application involving                         transport in media consisting of fibrous structures.***//",
