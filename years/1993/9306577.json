 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research Planning Grant for Women is aimed at gathering data               that will direct future investigations into the role of                         physiological processes in plant speciation.  The first objective               is to explore physiological adaptations to low water and nitrogen               availability in a single species, the desert annual composite,                  Townsendia annua by estimating correlations of water- and nitrogen-             use efficiency with fitness, measuring heritabilities and trade-                offs, and evaluating phenotypic plasticity and ontogenetic                      variation for physiological and other adaptations to low resource               availability.  This work will assess the genetic limitations to                 adaptations and will set the stage for later studies of                         physiological evolution.                                                                                                                                        Botanists have long recognized that the distributions of plants are             limited by their ability to tolerate stressful environments such as             deserts.  But this begs the question of why some plants can adapt               and others cannot.  This project explores the genetic potential for             physiological adaptation in a desert plant in the sunflower family.",
