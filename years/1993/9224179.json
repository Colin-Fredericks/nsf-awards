 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiber Optic Tapers are used in many applications including:                     Intensified Low Light Level Cameras, Night Vision Systems,                      UV/IR Spectroscopy and Medical, Industrial and Scientific X-                    Ray Imaging systems.  In these applications, the taper is                       coupled to a CCD imager in order to increase the area that                      can be imaged.  With rare exceptions, the tapers are under                      85mm diameter, the majority being 50mm diameter or less.                                                                                                        There is, however, a need for tapers in the 150mm to 200mm                      range, in Medical and Scientific application, where larger                      and higher resolution images are required.  Progress,                           however, has been restricted due to the relatively small                        size of CCD's and non-availability of large tapers.  To                         overcome this, smaller tapers have been built into arrays                       and coupled to multiple CCD's.  this is a costly and                            inefficient arrangement.                                                                                                                                        Prior to Phase I, limitations of existing taper technology                      had restricted the size attempted to 115mm.  Only a few of                      these costly units had been made, many manufacturing                            problems remaining unsolved, especially optical distortion                      and thermal damage to the glass.                                                                                                                                New technology developed at INCOM was applied to these                          problems during Phase I demonstrating that many existing                        limitations can be overcome.  Given additional research, the                    development of a completely new manufacturing process                           enabling the fabrication of Large Tapers is possible.  Thus,                    we propose to continue to advance the state of the art by                       conducting additional research on the more complex and                          larger tapers required for the advancement of this element                      of Electro-Optical Imaging Technology.",
