The Symposium, held every four years since 1966, is a  major event in astronomical hardware and technology.  It is  expected that the symposium will be attended by approximately 500  technical delegates from 15 different countries.  Conferences will  provide discussion on the dramatic changes in the design and  capabilities of large telescopes; examine the new developments of  the next generation of optical/infrared telescopes; and report on  the development of synthetic aperture telescopes built for the  spectral range from UV to submillimeter.  A new conference on  adaptive optics will report on new AO systems and components, and  serve as a forum for scientists and engineers working in the laser  beam control, astronomical imaging, electro-optical sensor, and  optomechanical component communities.  National Science Foundation  funding would allow the participation of speakers active in the  fields of astronomical hardware and technology who need partial  support to attend and present results of their research.  ***",
