 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy                 (AFM) are being used to directly image isolated fullerene molecules             and obtain a mapping of their local density of states.  The                     structure and electronic properties of the fullerenes are being                 studied by the surface microscopy tools.  Fullerene-metal,                      fullerene-semiconductor, and fullerene-molecule interactions in                 condensed films are under study.  Preparation of composite                      fullerene materials will be carried out using C-60 molecules                    embedded in methyl isobutyl ketone films.  The latter have revealed             pronounced intermolecular contrast, the origins of which are being              investigated in this project.  Finally, the tip-sample interactions             involved in the microscopy technique is being investigated with the             objective of improving the utility of these techniques.                         %%%                                                                             This project concerns the characterization, by surface microscopy,              of a technologically important group of the recently discovered                 fullerene molecules.  Materials composed of these molecules have                recently demonstrated dramatic properties of interest to solid                  state physicists as well as materials scientists and chemists.  The             proposed research will provide information about the structure and              electronic properties of these materials.  This information is of               fundamental interest and should pave the way toward practical                   application of these materials.",
