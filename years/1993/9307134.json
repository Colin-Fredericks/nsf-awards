 "awd_abstract_narration": "9307134  Estelle  The plant hormone auxin or indole acetic acid (IAA) plays a central  role in plant growth and development.  To understand the molecular  mechanism of auxin action Dr. Estelle and his colleagues are  studying a group of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana called the auxin-  resistance genes.  Mutations in these genes cause auxin resistance  and an array of developmental defects which appear to be related to  a reduction in auxin sensitivity.  In addition, mutations in each  of the auxin-resistance genes alter sensitivity to at least one  additional plant hormone.  It is hypothesized that this cross  resistance is a reflection of the integrated nature of plant  hormone action.    In this award, Dr. Estelle describes experiments which investigate  the function of the auxin-resistance gene AXR2.  Two dominant  mutations in this gene have been identified.  The prior studies  suggest that the AXR2 gene functions early in auxin response.  In  addition, histological studies on axr2 mutant plants suggest that  the AXR2 gene has an important role in auxin-regulated cell  elongation.  Three specific aims are defined.  First, the  investigators will analyze two rapid auxin responses which are  thought to be important in auxin-induced cell elongation.  Second,  they will isolate and characterize new alleles of the AXR2 gene.   They use these mutants to gain new insight into the function of the  wild-type gene.  Third, they will isolate the AXR2 gene by  positional cloning and characterize both wild-type and mutant  alleles at the molecular level.    In recent years, molecular and biochemical studies have resulted in  the identification and partial characterization of several proteins  which may function in auxin action.  However, it has been difficult  to determine the physiological role of these proteins.  A genetic  approach promises to make a unique contribution to our  understanding of this complex problem.  It is expected that the  genetic and molecular characterization of auxin-resi stance genes  like AXR2 will provide important new information on the mechanism  of hormone action.  ***",
