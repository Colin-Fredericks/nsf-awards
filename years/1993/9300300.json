 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds to the Department of Biology at                       Wake Forest University to continue a successful Research                        Experiences for Undergraduates SITE.  Undergraduate                             students, with the primary emphasis on women and minorities,                    will be given the opportunity of a 10 week research                             experience (Summer Undergraduate Research                                       Experience) with faculty members in the Department .  The                       research interests of the students will be matched with                         those of participating faculty.  In conjunction with the                        research experience, students will be exposed to a range of                     other activities, including two, overnight field trips and a                    weekly seminar program given by departmental faculty                            members. Special time will be set aside for instruction in                      elementary biostatistics, experimental design, slide                            preparation, etc. The summer's research activities will                         culminate with an afternoon-long colloquium, at which time                      the students will present the results of their work to                          faculty and other summer participants. Students will be                         quartered in one of the University's residential houses in                      order to facilitate maximum student-student interaction.                        During the final days of the summer program, the students                       will be joined by their faculty Mentors from their home                         institutions. In this way, it is hoped that the students can                    better share their research experiences with faculty with                       whom they may be spending the remainder of their                                undergraduate career. In this way they may also be able to                      sustain their research momentum and perhaps entice them into                    a graduate program on completion of their baccalaureate                         degrees.",
