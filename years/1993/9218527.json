 "awd_abstract_narration": "This four-year atmospheric chemistry project will extend a global               air sampling program to include a sampling site at South Pole                   Station.  Samples will be analyzed for the oxygen/nitrogen ratio                and for carbon dioxide content.  The work will be done                          cooperatively by the climatic baseline station operated by NOAA in              conjunction with the National Science Foundation.                                                                                                               Recent advances in instrumentation have made it possible to detect              variations in atmospheric oxygen content at the parts-per-million               level.  Such high precision atmospheric oxygen measurements are                 important in the context of climate and global change since they                are not only important in their own right, but are basic to such                issues of global warming as the carbon dioxide budget, ozone, and               marine productivity.                                                                                                                                            Data from South Pole Station are necessary to constrain the                     estimates of carbon dioxide fluxes due to marine productivity in                the southern hemisphere, and to confirm indications that the oxygen             concentration in the southern hemisphere is generally higher than               that in the northern hemisphere.",
