 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sampling equipment is being installed on the vessels SSV                        Corwith Cramer  and SSV Westward.  These vessels are being used                 for undergraduate education in the Sea Education Association                    (SEA) Semester program and for high school through adult                        education in SEA Seminar programs.  SEA is expanding its                        sampling capabilities into two areas: subsurface water sampling                 and coastal environmental and geological surveys.  Intelligent                  rosette sampling systems are permitting accurate deep water                     sampling and beach/landscape survey gear to be used in field                    trips in Woods Hole and during the various stops made by each                   vessel during research cruises.  SEA's primary goal in                          equipping the vessels is to install a multi component system of                 sampling and analytical gear that enables users with a wide                     range of technical backgrounds to participate in modern                         oceanographic research.",
