 "awd_abstract_narration": "Responses in plants to many environmental stresses include                      selective synthesis of proteins which enhance cell tolerance.  The              synthesis of these proteins is in part regulated at the level of                mRNA translation.  Selection of specific mRNAs for translation is               likely to depend on the amounts and activities of the initiation                factors which bind to the 5'-cap structure of mRNAs, and on the                 recognition of unique structures or sequences in the 5'-                        untranslated regions of the mRNAs which are selected.  This                     proposal focuses on factors which bind to the 5'-untranslated                   region of mRNA, elF-4A, 4F and (iso)4F, and will explore how                    changes in factor modifications and interactions affect protein                 synthesis.  Maize factors will be studied to determine: 1) the site             at which elF-4F is phosphorylated in vivo, 2) if phosphorylation of             elF-4F, 4F, or (iso)4F affects mRNA selection or translation                    efficiency in vitro, and 3) how phosphorylation patterns fluctuate              in response to environmental stress.  These experiments will yield              basic information on the mechanisms of protein synthesis and                    translation control in higher plants, and are an essential first                step in achieving our long-term goals of elucidating the importance             of initiation factor phosphorylation in response to the environment             and to other aspects of plant structural development.                           %%%                                                                             Responses in plants to many environmental stresses (e.g., flooding,             drought, heat, wounding) include selective synthesis of proteins                which enhance cell tolerance and plant survival.  The synthesis of              these proteins is regulated in part by the selective translation of             stress-response messenger RNAs (mRNA) into protein.  The                        mechanism(s) by which these specific mRNAs are selected from the                cellular mRNA pool is unknown, but is likely to depend on both the              structure of the mRNAs, and on the activity of the protein                      synthesis factors which bind to and recruit mRNAs for translation.              All of these factors can be modified by phosphorylation, and in                 some cases this has been shown to affect their function.  This                  proposal focuses on the three initiation factors which bind to the              5'-untranslated region of mRNA, and will explore how changes in                 their modifications and interactions affect protein synthesis.                  Maize factors will be studied to determine: 1) how phosphorylation              patterns fluctuate in response to environmental stress, 2) the                  location of phosphorylation sites in the proteins, and 3) the                   effect of specific phosphorylation events on factor function,                   subunit interactions, mRNA selection and translational efficiency.              These experiments will yield basic information on the mechanisms of             protein synthesis and translational control in higher plants, and               are an essential first step in achieving our long-term goals of                 elucidating the importance of initiation factor phosphorylation in              response to the environment and to events in plant development.",
