 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most materials exhibit slow fluctuations, with a broad distribution             of characteristic rates, in a variety of electrical, mechanical,                magnetic, and optical parameters.  Despite the ubiquity of a simple             form (1/f) for the frequency spectrum of such fluctuations, a wide              variety of mechanisms are involved, as has been demonstrated in                 past experiments in this project.  These fluctuations are of                    interest for two general reasons:  First, they limit the                        performance of a variety of sensors and devices.  Second, they                  provide a useful tool to study fundamental properties of materials,             especially glasses, which exhibit partially frozen random                       structures.  This proposal applied fluctuation techniques to                    investigate several materials with some of the most common forms of             frozen disorder.  These include amorphous silicon, charge-density               wave systems, several types of spin-glasses, spin-density wave                  magnetic domains, domain fluctuations in ferromagnets, and the new              giant-magneto-resistive materials.  The work will emphasize                     particularly the interplay between the chaotic behavior of some                 driven systems and the frozen randomness present in equilibrium.                %%%                                                                             New technologies often require new materials and increasingly                   involve the use of very small structures.  In small structures such             properties as the electrical resistivity of materials are generally             not constant, but fluctuate in time.  Such fluctuations are often               the most important factor in limiting the miniaturization of                    devices.  Past experiments in this project have shown that a wide               variety of mechanisms lie behind these fluctuations in different                materials.  This proposal explores the origins of the fluctuations              in some technically important materials, including amorphous                    silicon and the new giant-magneto-resistive materials.  Particular              attention is paid to developing a general understanding of the very             common but poorly understood types of materials known as glasses,               which exhibit partially frozen random structures.",
