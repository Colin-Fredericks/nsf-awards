 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project                 is in the general area of spectrometry in the subfield of                       chemical instrumentation.  Recent years have seen significant                   advances in light detection technology and computer processing                  power.  Very sensitive two-dimensional array detectors, e.g. CCD                arrays, and fast computers capable of processing vast quantities                of near real-time data are available at moderate cost.  The                     missing building block in the design and development of a                       spectrometer that can take advantage of these technologies is an                optical system capable of two dimensional imaging of high                       quality, particularly in a compact short focal-length                           configuration.  Chromex has developed a method of producing high                quality aspheric optics, the essential optical components for                   stigmatic imaging capability.  This technology will be applied in               the investigation of a full-spectrum multiple-input stigmatic-                  imaging spectrograph design.  The spectrograph will be small                    (100mm focal length) and extremely rugged.  Fiber optic                         interfaces will be investigated that will allow up to eight                     simultaneous inputs.  The Phase I research established that the                 concept is feasible.  Further, the Phase I results showed that an               imaging spectrograph of this concept can be expected to provide a               significant gain in signal-to-noise over conventional designs.                  The research in this Phase II project will result in a                          spectrograph with unprecedented capabilities.                                                                                                                   This research will result in the development of a spectrometer                  with capabilities that are not currently available.  The ability                to measure spectra from multiple in-situ sources will provide an                instrument useful in remote applications employing multiple                     sensors such as process and combustion monitoring.",
