 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351009  Malaviya  The purpose of this project is to develop a set of innovative  experimental exercises for a laboratory course in a new  engineering physics program.  The program offers a valuable  strategic vehicle for students to pursue education and research  in areas cutting across traditional disciplinary lines. The lab  course is an important element in the new baccalaureate  engineering physics curriculum. The equipment requested herein  will be used to develop experiments in such areas as computer  interfacing, electromagnetic field behavior and imaging, laser  holography and other laser optics applications, fluid systems  behavior, particle interactions with fields and matter, etc.  The new experiments will involve state-of-the-art techniques  with direct relevance to real-life experiences in the high tech  R & D enterprise and should considerably enhance the scope and  diversity of the students' laboratory experience. Results of  the project will be adequately documented and widely  disseminated for use by other universities and colleges for lab  and related course work in their science and engineering  curricula.  ***",
