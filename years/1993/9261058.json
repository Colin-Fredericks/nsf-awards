 "awd_abstract_narration": "Passive restraint government standards have resulted in the                     introduction of passenger side airbags for most cars in 1993.                   TIP Engineering has initiated a significant amount of R&D                       activity in developing the next state of the art passenger                      airbags (PAB) deployment door without any visible cut lines.                    The concept is referred to as the hidden seam deployment door.                                                                                                  The major parameter of a successful hidden seam door function is                the scoring of the back surface of the skin.   Present technology               can only accomplish this criteria by mechanical means.  TIP would               cut the skin by the use of a heat/energy/pressure pyrotechnic)                  device to the back surface of the skin.  At the time the airbag                 is fired, the same command signal would initiate the pyrotechnic                device to ignite creating an instant cut line along the periphery               of the airbag opening.  The pyrotechnic devices presently being                 considered are used primarily in the defense industry as an                     initiator to an explosive device.                                                                                                                               We propose to significantly revise and redevelop these devices                  for application on the airbag door.  The anticipated benefits are               to improve safety, warranty, and obvious styling improvement at a               reduced cost.",
