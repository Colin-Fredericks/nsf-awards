 "awd_abstract_narration": "Murdocca         In this project a system is being built to translate a  dataflow language into hardware and implement the hardware on an  optical gate array.  The system is comprised of three components:   a compiler to translate a dataflow language such as ID into a  dataflow graph; a method for converting dataflow graphs into  hardware described by a hardware description language, along with  a simulator; and a synthesis program for mapping HDL descriptions  onto an optical gate array.  The optical gate array consists of  planes of electronic gates, with the planes interconnected by  free-space optics.  An advantage of this kind of gate array is  quick reconfiguration of the optical interconnections which  allows dataflow graphs to be changed quickly.         This project is applicable to the development of advanced  integrated engineering cells for manufacturing.  Because of noise  immunity and lack of electromagnetic interference, optical  computation is well-suited to the factory floor.  Reconfigurable  optical computers of the type under development in this project  may allow high-speed computation to be inserted into  manufacturing processes in new ways.",
