Toddlers and their mothers are currently               being studied using observations, reports, and experimental                     paradigms.  Kochanska's research considers the role of                          temperament in moral development and brings together parental                   socialization and children's temperatment as influences in the                  early formation of conscience.                                                                                                                                  In the SGER request, Fowles will collaborate with Kochanska to                  examine the physiological correlates of conscience development.                 Specifically, he will look at electrodermal reactivity, which has               been considered an index of individual temperamental qualities.                 He will also measure heart rate.  This collaboration is part of a               strong trend in the field to add biological measurement to the                  study of personality development.                                                                                                                               Imaginative procedures have been developed to carry out this                    research.  A \"space lab\" will be used as the setting with T-                    shirts for the children carrying the logo: \"University of Iowa                  Astronaut Training\".  A special chair with foot and arm rests                   will be used; the chair can be slightly tipped back to simulate                 the astronaut-type sitting position.  These procedures have been                developed in consultation with Nancy Eisenberg, Jerry Kagan, and                Nathan Fox, researchers who have studied physiological processes                in small children.                                                                                                                                              The physiological assessments will be tied to other measures                    planned for the fall of 1993.  This timeliness is the reason for                the SGER application, with its quick turn-around time.                                                                                                          Program Director recommends an award of $49,569, one half of                    which ($24,785) should come from the CPL cluster reserve, with                  the remaining funds from the Social Psychology program.",
