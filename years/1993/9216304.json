 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is in the general area of analytical and surface                   chemistry and in the subfield of biosensors.  During the tenure of              this three-year continuing grant, Professor Rechnitz and his                    students will continue the development of tissue based biosensors               using plant and animal tissue materials as molecular recognition                elements in conjunction with a variety of transducers.  This                    research, which was begun under NSF grant CHE-8921156, will focus               on two novel initiatives.  In the first, genetically modified                   plant tissue materials will be used in order to achieve improved                sensor stability and to extend the range of possible analytes.  In              the second, biomagnetic current probes will be introduced as                    transducers in the design of neuronal biosensors.  It is expected               that such probes could function as non-invasive transducers and                 thereby improve the useful lifetimes of chemoreceptor based                     biosensors.                                                                     %%%                                                                             This research is aimed at overcoming some of the major technical                problems encountered in biosensor research and, more importantly,               to introduce and provide conceptual advances for the future                     development of analytical biosensors.",
