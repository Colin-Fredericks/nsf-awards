Experimental simulations of volcanic eruptions will be                          carried out at small scale with systems which duplicate the                     velocities and accelerations generated during eruption by                       bubble growth and magma fragmentation.  The apparatus                           consists of a test cell which exhausts into a tank which can                    be evacuated.  Preliminary results show that the simple                         system CO2-H2O exhibits a variety of eruptive styles,                           ranging from explosive eruption, to violent bubbling and                        degassing (but no eruption), to quiet exsolution with                           occasional bubbling.  This work will be continued in three                      directions:  (1) experimental simulation under a variety of                     controlled conditions, varying such parameters as viscosity,                    surface tension, diffusion coefficient of CO2, chamber                          shape, pressure, etc., (2)  theoretical study of scaling                        laws for extrapolating experimental laboratory results to                       natural magmatic systems; and (3) development of methods for                    observing and quantifying the mechanism of fragmentation.",
