 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study the effects involuntary resettlement on agricultural production in the Manatali region of western Mali where approximately 10,000 people were relocated in 1986-87.  Now, 5-10 years afterwards, the people have passed through the early transition phase of adaptation to relocation and can use new resources for social an economic development.  The researchers hypothesize that the interplay of the process of involuntary relocation with the system of socio-economic stratification will affect the social division of labor, the major strategies of agricultural production, and hence levels of production.   The project will use intensive interview and participant observation to follow a sample of approximately 120 households to determine patterns of productive activities, access to productive resources, household division of labor, and levels of production.  It will be carried out by a team of four social scientists pairing the American principal investigator with social scientists from the Institut des Sciences Humanies (ISH) in Mali.  This team worked on the initial studies of this area in the late 1980s and by working together again on this re-study the team will provide an optimal way to gather information on changes over time.   At a theoretical level, this project will deepen our understanding of how rural stratification systems work in a territory where access to the major resource of land remains embedded in social and political control.  At an applied level, this greater understanding of rural stratification systems and their effects on agricultural production will allow planners to design more  equitable programs which allow people to produce in a more economically and environmental sustainable fashion.  This project will also increase the scientific capability of the ISH social scientists of Mali.  ***    d as to whether the proposed research would be as successful as anticipated.  Of greatest concern to the panelists was the relatively vague specification of methods and the absence of clear descriptions regarding how the methods related to the hypotheses that would be tested.
