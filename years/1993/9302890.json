The isotopic compositions of marine Hf and Pb               indicate that large proportions of the oceanic inventory of these               elements are derived from 'mantle' sources: young volcanic rocks of             subduction/.orogenic zones and mid-ocean ridges.  Hf and Pb are                 complementary because of their different oceanic residence times.               Hf has a residence time in the oceans similar to ocean mixing                   times, making it relatively isotopically homogeneous throughout the             oceans. New analytical developments make it now possible to measure             the concentration and isotopic composition of Hf in reasonable                  volumes of natural waters.  Its marine chemistry can now be better              defined.  Pb has a short residence time in seawater, and the                    hydrothermal flux from mid-ocean ridges locally dominates its                   isotopic composition, thus allowing regional variations in this                 flux to be determined.  Models of mantle flux variations will be                based on isotope systematics that allow the proportion of mantle Hf             and Pb to the oceans to be determined unequivocally.  Combination               of Pb and Hf with Sr flux models will make it possible to define                past changes in mantle fluxes to the oceans more accurately than                has been possible by using Sr alone.  It will then be possible to               test the hypothesis that faster spreading rates, volcanism rates,               and increased mantle fluxes to the oceans are synonymous by                     comparison with other measures of spreading rate variations. This               in turn will allow a refinement of models of global geochemical                 cycles of other elements, such as carbon.",
