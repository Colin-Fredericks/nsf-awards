 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Faculty Internship provides the Principal                  Investigator an opportunity to study a high-volume robotic                      automation system and interact with the designers and users of such             a system.  This system is the printer assembly system designed to               assemble on the order of 100,000 printers per month.  One of the                key problems in high volume (hundreds of thousands of units per                 month) mechanical assembly is the lead time required to design and              implement automation systems and the additional time required to                ramp automated production to full volume for a new or redesigned                product.  The research is concerned with understanding the factors              contributing to these long lead times and lack of flexibility for               automated assembly systems.                                                          On the basis of the collaboration of the university and                    industrial in conjunction with study of the system at hand, the                 major factors contributing to long lead times and lack of                       flexibility will be determined, alternative designs proposed, and               proof-of-concept experiments conducted.",
