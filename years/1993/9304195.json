The research will  involve undergraduates in laboratory experience useful for a  scientific career.  %%%  The goals of this research are to examine the effect of synthetic  analogs of membrane components on the function of receptor proteins  which exist embedded within the cell membrane, and to use these  compounds to study the phospholipid composition of cellular  membranes and its regulation in animal cells.  Also, the  investigator will continue to develop the use of the ciliated  protozoan as a model system for the study of eukaryotic  phospholipid metabolism and the role of different phospholipids in  membrane structure and function.
