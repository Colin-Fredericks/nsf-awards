 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project integrates advanced analytical techniques into an                  undergraduate geological engineering curriculum.  An x-ray                      diffraction system (XRD) will be used in conjunction with an                    existing scanning electron microscope (SEM) to develop an                       accelerated educational program.  Geological engineers                          typically enter the workplace with only a B.S. degree and,                      thus, they are not trained in analytical methodologies normally                 taught in graduate-level courses. We propose to remediate this                  educational deficiency through a coordinated, multi-year                        program involving 9 courses and 11 faculty. XRD and SEM                         techniques and applications will be introduced into the                         undergraduate curriculum using an applied, hands-on approach.                   A survey of 13 other geological engineering programs in the                     United States indicates that (a) our proposed project is                        innovative and unique; (b) there is a great need for this type                  of training; and (c) at least 11 schools would seriously                        consider implementing curricular changes modeled on ours.                       The program will begin in the first semester of the sophomore                   year by introducing XRD/SEM theory, operation, and basic skills                 into Mineralogy and Materials of the Earth courses. In                          subsequent Petrology, Structural Geology, and Geomorphology                     courses, skills introduced in the sophomore year will be                        maintained and further developed allowing students to solidify                  their understanding of basic principles and advance to more                     complex, process-related applications. At the senior level, new                 laboratory exercises in capstone courses, Petroleum Geology,                    Mineral Exploration, Hydrogeology, and Engineering Geology                      Project Design, will expose students to advanced XRD/SEM                        techniques for solving a wide range of real-life geological                     engineering problems. The feasibility of our approach was                       assessed during a 2-year trial period involving sophomore                       Mineralogy and junior Petrology students in which we found the                  students to be enthusiastic about the applied, hands-on nature                  of the program. When the project is fully implemented, annual                   participation will be approximately 125 undergraduate                           engineers.",
