 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key component of expert and advice-giving systems is their               ability to provide explanations to their users.  Unfortunately,                 current systems assume that a single explanation is sufficient and              that the user's only feedback will be requests for further                      elaboration.  In reality, however, users frequently find fault with             the provided explanations and respond with explanations of their                own for why the system's response is unacceptable.  The inability               to understand or respond intelligently to this user feedback                    significantly degrades the value of existing systems.  This project             initiates a research program to explore how to extend expert and                advice-giving systems to understand user response to their                      explanations and to revise these explanations accordingly.  The                 object is an initial theory of how user feedback is understood and              explanation revised in response to it, along with a prototype                   program embodying this theory.  The proposed work will build on                 earlier research on using abstract planning knowledge to handle one             specific class of user feedback.//",
