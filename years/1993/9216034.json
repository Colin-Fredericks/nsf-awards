 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project parallel and distributed processing systems                will be studied from a queueing theoretic point of view, and                    related problems of dynamical optimization will be addressed.  A                fundamental understanding of how concurrency, coordination and                  scheduling issues, emerging at the level of basic operations,                   affect the macroscopic dynamics and performance of such systems                 will be acquired.  General analysis techniques and systematic                   design principles will be identified.  The design (synthesis) of                efficient operational schemes will be addressed, for the                        optimization of parallel and distributed processing systems arising             in computing and flexible manufacturing, with respect to criteria               concerning throughput, delays buffer occupancies, lead balancing,               fault-tolerance etc.  Basic prototypical models, extracted from                 various practical processing situations in computing and                        manufacturing, will be studied in a unified framework, with                     emphasis on rigorous mathematical results and provable bounds.  New             queueing models will be developed to capture essential features of              concurrency and coordination and allowing the systematic analysis               of the dynamics and performance of processing protocols.  Real-time             scheduling and resource allocation schemes will be studied in a                 natural stochastic framework.  In cases where the relevant optimal              scheduling algorithms are of high complexity, the focus will be on              exploring simple (low complexity) scheduling schemes. Other aspects             of stochastic, dynamic scheduling will also be examined, if                     necessary by simulation.                                                             The research should develop an understanding of the dynamical              aspects of parallel and distributed processing in computer systems              and flexible manufacturing, at a fundamental mathematical level,                and for establishing techniques to optimize performance, based on               a solid mathematical methodology.  The applied branch of this                   research will study specific practical systems that motivate the                general models.",
