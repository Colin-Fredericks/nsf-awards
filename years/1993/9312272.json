This is one of a series of workshops which SCOPE  (UNESCO's Scientific Committee on the Protection of the  Environment) has proposed for this topic in relation to 12 biotic  regions:  tundra, ocean upwelling systems, estuaries,  Mediterranean, islands, boreal forest, coral reefs, savanna,  tropical forests, freshwater systems, temperate forests, and arid  zones.  Following the workshops, there will be an overall  synthesis meeting in Asilomar, California, in 1944, leading to an  unprecedented knowledge base and a substantial publication in  support of future strategies for research and conservation of  biodiversity.  %%%  Specific questions to be addressed in the workshop include:  Do  losses of biodiversity compromise the capacity of coral reefs to  maintain their functional and structural integrity?  What are the  implications of biodiversity for the sustainable use of reef  resources, both for reef-based recreation, eco-tourism and other  commercial activity, and for subsistence farming and harvesting  (particularly in poor and developing countries)?  Over what  spatial and temporal scales are alterations in biodiversity on  coral reefs manifest as alterations in biogeochemical processes,  and do they contribute significantly to changes in ocean-  atmosphere fluxes?  ***",
