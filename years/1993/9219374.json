 "awd_abstract_narration": "A novel DNA transposon was found in a chlorate resistant                   mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana.  The element hybridizes to several              distinct sequences in the Arabidopsis genome and thus is a member               of a new family of transposons.  Transposons are not only                       interesting in themselves but often prove to be important tools for             cloning genes and serving as gene vectors for their native genome.              We propose to characterize this transposon and develop it as a tool             for studying the genome of this important model plant system.                   %%%                                                                             Arabidopsis thaliana has become the focus of many molecular studies             of plant genomes because of the small size and limited repetitive               sequences of the genome. Although the maize transposable element Ac             has been useful in obtaining mutants in Arabidopsis, much effort                has not yet led to the cloning of a gene.  Thus the possibility of              an endogenous mobile element which can be characterized and                     possibly engineered to provide a much needed tool for the study of              this model plant is exciting.",
