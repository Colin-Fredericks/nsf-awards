 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Texas A&M University will operate the R/V GYRE during 1993             as a general oceanographic vessel in support of NSF-funded research             projects.  The Gyre is a 182' general research vessel constructed               by the US Navy in 1973 and modified in 1980 and 1984.  The Navy is              in the process of transferring the title for the vessel to TAMU.                The ship is scheduled for 110 operating days in 1993, of which 23               days are in support of NSF-sponsored programs.  The ship operates               primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern Atlantic.                                                                                                           This vessel is part of a fleet used by the National Science                Foundation to support oceanographic research projects.  Most                    oceanographic research projects require highly specialized                      equipment and extensive support from a ship's crew members.  An                 increasing number of research projects require equipment that must              be permanently installed on a ship and for which the ship must be               specifically designed.  Such equipment also requires highly trained             crew members for maintenance and operation.  These vessels do not               operate in the same manner as general cargo or fishing vessels, and             therefore, NSF supports the operation of a variety of vessels                   specifically dedicated to oceanographic research.  These vessels                are operated by universities and research institutions around the               country.",
