We have extensive scientific knowledge of                                                                                                judicial processes in the U.S., but relatively little empirical                 work has been done in other countries.  The scientific questions                                                                                                are especially important in light of the many newly democratized                                                                                                nations currently engaged in constitution-making and the increasing                                                                                             prominence of courts in policy-making processes throughout the                  world.  These questions include: the extent of activist                         constitutionalism in democracies, the role orientations of judges,                                                                                              the role of interest groups and the legal profession in the                     creation of a judicial agenda, the extent and structure of interest                                                                                             group conflict, which interests are served and which are not served                                                                                             in the judicial arena, and the judicial control of constitutional                                                                                               and other rights claims.  The extent of change in the political                 role of courts can be assessed by analyzing the extent of change                                                                                                in the judicial agenda over time because politically activist                   courts in effect invite certain kinds of issues to resolve.  It is                                                                                              important to ask, therefore, what is the mix of traditional and new                                                                                             issues, which issues are claiming an increasing place on the                    agenda, and what interest groups are pressing them.                                                                                                             This doctoral dissertation will examine changes from 1960 to 1990                                                                                               in the nature of issues considered by courts of last resort in                  Canada, England, India and the United States.  In addition, the                 study will assess the relationship between agenda change and other                                                                                              theoretically important developments in the political system of the                                                                                             four countries.  Three issues will be examined in greater detail:                                                                                               environmental policy, in particular water pollution policy; women's                                                                                             rights, especially in employment; and press censorship.  Data on                                                                                                case issues and decisions will be collected and coded from the                  official court reports of each country.  Judicial biographies and                                                                                               memoirs, as well as scholarly analyses of judicial careers, will                                                                                                be examined for information on judicial role orientations.  Semi-                                                                                               structured interviews will be conducted with representatives of the                                                                                             interest groups involved in raising each of the three issue areas.                                                                                                                                                                              This research will make an important contribution to our                        theoretical understanding of judicial processes across political                                                                                                systems, in addition to adding significantly to our store of                    scientific data on courts.  It will provide the basis for a broader                                                                                             understanding of the relationship between judicial processes and                                                                                                policy-making in any political system.",
