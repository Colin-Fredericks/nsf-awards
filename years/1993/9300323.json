The              purpose of this program is to provide research experiences for 12               undergraduate students each year in this area at the University of              Missouri-Columbia (UMC) during the summers of 1993, 1994, and 1995.             At least half of the students each year will be selected from                   institutions other than UMC, with several recruited from Stephen's              College (a women's college), Lincoln University (HBCU), and other               undergraduate schools in the state.  Each student will undertake                a specific research project, and a faculty advisor will work with               the student to develop his/her research skills.  An essential                   element of the program will be its emphasis on professional                     development of the students.  The purpose is to infuse bright                   undergraduate students with an enthusiasm towards research careers,             including graduate level education.",
