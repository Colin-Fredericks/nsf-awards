 "awd_abstract_narration": "9350523  Ridd    A growing world-wide supply of environmental data, the  availability of sophisticated and inexpensive computer-based  hardware, and the development of user-friendly, flexible  software makes possible the development of modules which can  put students in touch with the world at any scale from the  locality of the student to the world at large.  Many  national and international organizations are networked and  committed to collecting and sharing increasing volumes of  Earth-environmental data.  There is a growing awareness of  global change and environmental stress and the  responsibility humans have for these conditions and their  amelioration.  Students can and should be part of the quest  to explore these questions in new ways.  Through hands-on,  image analysis and Geographic Information Systems (GIS)  digital map manipulation, secondary school students can  overlay remote-sensed data to see vital relations at the  interface between humans and the natural world.  Two  modules, of two weeks duration, are developed in this pilot  project:  One is global in perspective such as  decertification or tropical deforestation; the other  concerns local conditions such as water use.  The modules  are developed by teachers, science educators and scientists  working together and are field tested in diverse locations.   The software runs on a 386 equivalent computer with enough  memory to accommodate ArcView files and 4 MB of RAM.  The  project is governed by a national advisory board and has two  external evaluators to document the effects on students and  teachers.  ***",
