The workshop will be a pilot program to extend the type of  teacher education that SACNAS has successfully carried out in the  past in the one and two day workshops that have been held  immediately preceding and in conjunction with the SACNAS national   conferences.  These workshops, which have typically used half a day  to cover one subject, have provided teachers of Chicano and Native  American students with curricula and training of many examples of  culturally relevant subjects that help increase the student's  desire to learn science.  The workshop presenters have been  research scientists and science educators who have researched the  contributions of indigenous peoples to science and have developed  methods to integrate them into the teaching of science.  The two  week program will allow the training to occur with much more depth  and interaction which will result in a more highly trained teacher  and which will provide the presenters the opportunity to improve  their material and presentation.  The pilot program will give  SACNAS presenters and organizers the opportunity to learn to work  with this more longer and intensive workshop and to overcome any  difficulties that may arise.  A successful summer Teacher Workshop  program will greatly increase the extent of the teachers who can  participate in SACNAS Science Teachers Workshops, which presently  can only accommodate those teachers living near the cities where  SACNAS holds its national co nference.  The cost of the pilot  program (77,888) will be shared by NSF ($45,272), SACNAS ($24,616)  and the host university ($8000).",
