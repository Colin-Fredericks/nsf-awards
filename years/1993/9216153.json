 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intriguing phenomena have been observed experimentally in                  highly elastic and very viscous fluids, such as polymer solutions               and melts. Such non-Newtonian materials can be modeled                          mathematically as viscoelastic fluids with fading memory, which                 exhibit behavior intermediate between the nonlinear hyperbolic                  response of purely elastic materials and the strongly diffusive,                parabolic response of viscous Newtonian fluids. In certain flow                 regimes, these fluids exhibit instabilities that severely disrupt               polymer processing. Laboratory observations have found \"spurt \"                 instabilities in pressure-gradient driven flows (Vinogradov et                  al., 1972), persistent oscillations in flow at fixed volumetric                 flow rate (Lim & Schowalter, 1989), and anomalies in step shear                 strain experiments (Morrison & Larson, 1991). Many researchers                  attribute the observations to \"slip\" or \"apparent slip, \" i.e.,                 loss of adhesion of the fluid to the wall. This project involves                the investigation of an alternative explanation for these                       phenomena. The hypothesis is that all three have a common origin                in bulk material properties, rather than adhesive properties.                        To test this hypothesis, the corresponding one-dimensional                 shear flows pressure-driven and piston-driven flow in a slit die,               and Couette flow are modeled. The characteristic feature of the                 fluid models employed is a non-monotone relation between steady                 shear stress and strain rate. Analysis and numerical simulations                show that the polymer system changes state in a thin layer near                 the wall, giving the appearance of a slip layer. The structure of               solutions of initial/boundary-value problems for non-monotone                   models is remarkably rich, and the development of numerical                     methods capable of simulating these flow problems has interest in               its own right. The same basic system of time-dependent,                         quasilinear partial differential equations is used to model all                 three experiments; different forcing terms, as well as boundary                 and initial conditions, are used in the three cases. The                        governing system is globally well-posed in time, in two senses:                 with respect to classical solutions arising from smooth initial                 data, and with respect to \"almost classical\" solutions,                         containing discontinuities in the stress and strain rate.                       Calculated solutions are in good qualitative agreement with the                 experiments, showing spurt in pressure-driven flow, persistent                  oscillations in piston-driven flow, and the development of                      anomalies in the relaxation modulus after a step strain. In terms               of a reduced approximating system, spurt and its related                        phenomena in pressure-driven flow can be analyzed by using                      phase-plane techniques. The analysis for piston-driven and step                 strain experiments is more difficult because the system is                      infinite-dimensional. For example, numerical simulations strongly               suggest that there is a Hopf bifurcation in piston-driven flow,                 leading to the observed persistent oscillations. In order to                    compare predictions to experiment, it is crucial to determine how               the amplitude and frequency of the limit cycle depends on                       physical parameters. This requires detailed analysis of the                     governing equations. This is required in each of the experiments,               and that is the central focus of this research. The theme of this               project has been and will continue to be the use of numerical                   simulation to guide analysis of the governing equations and                     approximations to them, in order to identify the time-scales,                   amplitudes, and other characteristic features of the predictions                of the model.",
