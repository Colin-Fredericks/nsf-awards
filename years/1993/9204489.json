 "awd_abstract_narration": "Frohman intends to pursue the study of three-dimensional                   manifolds, especially topics associated with Heegaard splittings                and minimal surfaces and the representation theory of knot groups               and three-manifold groups.  For instance, he is planning to study               the finiteness of Heegaard splittings of bounded genus of three-                manifolds up to homeomorphism.  Another problem he is pursuing is               the construction of functors that are similar to coupled                        topological quantum field theories using the intersection                       homology of moduli spaces of semistable holomorphic bundles with                parabolic structure over a nonsingular algebraic curve.                              Three-dimensional manifolds are very natural objects for                   topologists to study, since (ignoring time) we live in a physical               world of three dimensions.  Also dimension three is the first                   dimension where many types of rich complexity arise.  In fact, it               is a notorious and paradoxical fact that some of the difficulties               presented by three-dimensional topology disappear again in higher               dimensions.  For example, the celebrated Poincare conjecture                    about the characterization of the three-dimensional sphere                      remains as challenging as when it was first posed about the turn                of the century, while the analogous propositions in higher                      dimensions have all now been settled.  Frohman is exploring some                of these mysteries and sharpening the available tools of the                    trade.",
