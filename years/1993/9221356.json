 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding over a two year period to permit                    Dr. Rick Millane of Purdue University to travel to New Zealand                  once each year to conduct collaborative research on structural                  studies of chitin with Drs. Kenneth M. Rudall and George R. Clark               of the University of Auckland Department of Chemistry. The                      molecular and crystal structure of the gamma-allomorph of chitin                will be determined in atomic detail.  The overall structural                    features of a variety of chitin-protein complexes from different                sources will be determined. This information will be used to                    examine relationships between the structural features and the                   biological distribution and function of chitin. The results of                  this study will further extend the knowledge base on the                        structures and functionality of these polysaccharide systems that               are important components of the exoskeletons of insects,                        crustaceans and invertebrates. Structural details on chitin-                    protein complexes may also provide information relevant to                      cellulose composites in plant cell walls and collagen composites                in mammalian connective tissue.                                                                                                                                 This cooperative research capitalizes on the unique and                         complementary skills of the investigators. For Dr. Millane this                 project adds an international aspect to his on-going NSF                        funded research. The Auckland chemists have considerable                        experience in biophysical studies of chitin and chitin-protein                  complexes. Dr. Rudall is particularly skilled in the extraction                 and preparation of chitin microfibrils suitable for x-ray                       diffraction analysis. Dr. Clark is an experienced x-ray                         crystallographer. Dr. Millane is an experienced x-ray fiber                     diffractionist who has determined the structures of a number of                 polysaccharides and polynucleotides using this technique.",
