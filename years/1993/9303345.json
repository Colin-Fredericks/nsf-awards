 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-year research program involving nuclear scientists from                 the University of Dallas, the United States Naval Academy, and                  the University of Kentucky is proposed.  This program is designed               to include active participation by undergraduate students in the                research effort.  The experiments will be conducted at the                      University of Kentucky Van de Graff laboratory using the (n,n'y)                reaction mechanism.  The focus of this research is the study of                 mixed-symmetry, or isovector, collective excitations in the N=84                and Z=52 vibrational nuclei.  The specific nuclei planned to                    study are 142 Ce, 144Nd and 120, 122Te.  Fragmentation of the                   quadrupole isovector strength will be explored.  Considerable                   spectroscopic information will be ascertained in achieving this                 goal since M1 and E2 transition rates and E2/M1 multipole mixing                ratios are required to interpret the mixed-symmetry character of                ollective quadrupole levels.  Transition rates will be determined               from nuclear lifetimes measured using the Doppler-shift                         attenuation method following inelastic neutron scattering.                      Comparisons of our data with theoretical models will be made to                 obtain a better understanding of the low-lying collective                       excitations of these nuclei and their proton-neutron symmetry                   properties.",
