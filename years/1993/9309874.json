 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. P. Bion Griffin, Mr. Ken Stark will                  collect data for his doctoral dissertation. Preliminary survey has              revealed the presence of rich archaeological sites in the Molucca               Islands of Indonesia. While it is likely that this area was first               inhabited by humans at least 40,000 years ago, very little is known             of the prehistory of this region. Mr. Stark and colleagues will                 carry out a three stage field project. First they will return to                two known rockshelter sites, one in a humid coastal the other in a              drier inland environment. Test excavations will be conducted to                 characterize site stratigraphy and depth, to collect faunal                     botanical, lithic and ceramic materials as well as materials                    suitable for radiocarbon dating. In the second stage of the                     research intensive areal survey will be carried out to locate other             sites. Finally large-scale excavation will be conducted in the most             promising localities to enlarge sample size and to provide                      additional information on human activities and how they changed                 over time.                                                                                                                                                      Archaeologists are extremely interested in early human adaptation               to tropical rainforest environments. Although it has appeared, on               the basis of ethnographic evidence, that hunters and gatherers                  successfully adapted to such regions, recent studies have thrown                doubt on this conclusion. Some anthropologists have argued that                 rainforests are carbohydrate poor and that what at first appear to              be ancient ways of life recently changed by contact with                        agriculturalists, are not so. Rather a \"pure\" hunting and gathering             lifestyle in such environments is impossible; it also is recent and             dependent on nutritional input from domestic plants. The Moluccas               provide an excellent site to examine this issue since it is likely              that hunters and gatherers lived on the island by ca. 40,000 years              ago and that the introduction of agriculture dates back only                    several thousand years. Mr. Stark's research will address this                  question. Assuming that evidence of early habitation is found, the              research should shed light on the specific subsistence adaptations              which were employed and examine how they changed over time. It will             also examine how introduced domestic crops affected the traditional             pattern.                                                                                                                                                        This research is important for several reasons. It will increase                archaeological knowledge in a relatively unknown part of the world.             It will shed new light on how humans adapt, at a simple level of                technology, to tropical environments and it will contribute to the              training of an extremely promising young scientist.",
