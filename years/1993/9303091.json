 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates electronic and magnetic properties of                 matter that are intrinsic to thin film structures, surfaces, and                interfaces.  The propsed work is driven by new capabilities to                  deliberately modify and characterize physical properties of matter              that affect magnetic behavior, and by recent improvements in                    magnetically sensitive spectroscopic techniques.  The experimental              approach combines novel materials synthesis, advanced structure                 determination methods, and spin sensitive spectroscopic techniques.             The principle scientific objectives of the program are to explore               the relationship between atomic level structure and magnetism, and              to probe fundamental concepts in phase transitions.  Proposed                   experiments address atomic level factors that affect magnetic                   anisotropy, magnetic coercive forces, and magnetic remanence in                 ultra-thin epitaxial films and magnetic coupling through ultra-thin             non-magnetic layers.  The experiments also address issues in                    statistical mechanics including the notion of two-dimensional                   universality classes and related specific theoretical predictions               of scaling parameters and critical exponents.  These important                  concepts are studied under experimental conditions that represent               a transition from the two-dimensional to three-dimensional state of             matter.                                                                         %%%                                                                             Thin film and multilayer magnetic materials offer attractive                    opportunities for future development of recording media and of                  novel high-density discrete digital data storage concepts.  These               materials also offer important new scientific opportunities for                 seeking a more thorough understanding of the broad range of                     phenomena that account for the commercial importance of magnetic                materials.  The opportunities are especially attractive in the area             of thin film magnetic structures because new processing technology              and measurement techniques permit synthesis and characterization of             engineered materials having selected characteristics.  This                     research program investigates several related aspects of thin film              magnetic behavior that are relevant to advanced materials                       processing and potential application of thin film materials.  The               principle emphasis of the program is to understand the relationship             between the materials processing (film growth), the structure of                the films including compositional and atomic level effects, and the             resulting magnetic characteristics that can be exploited for                    various applications.",
