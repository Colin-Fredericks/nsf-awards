 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. E. Charles Adams Mr. William Walker will             collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will participate in              the excavation of a large or \"great kiva\" which is part of the                  Homol'ovi II site located in northeastern Arizona. The size of the              kiva, ca. 11 m. by 6 m., makes it large both in Southwestern terms              and also in relation to other ritual structures at the site. In the             course of extensive excavation the site will be trenched to divide              it into four quadrants which will be mapped and excavated in their              entirety. Pollen and flotation samples will be collected from                   features and other locations to assess the ritual use of plants.                The chronology of use will be determined through ceramic as well as             tree ring and radiocarbon dating. In addition to the ceramic                    materials, lithic and groundstone artifacts as well as faunal and               macrobotanical remains will be studied. In this way the history of              the structure and its use can be reconstructed.                                                                                                                 In the centuries preceding Columbus complex societies developed in              the U.S. Southwest. They were characterized by large population                 aggregations, construction of multistory \"apartment\" houses and of              ritual structures. Archaeologists want to understand how complex                societies develop and are maintained and for this reason have                   focussed on this Southwest phenomenon. Based both on archaeological             and ethnographic evidence, it is known that religion played a                   central role both in social control and integration. Just how it                functioned and changed over time however is unknown. Through a                  study of this grand kiva Mr. Walker will address this issue.                    Because ritual features are added over time the history of the                  structure and its use can potentially be reconstructed.                                                                                                         This project is important for several reasons. It will increase our             understanding of how complex societies emerge and are maintained.               Mr. Walker also wants to develop new techniques both to excavate                and to interpret architectural remains such as kivas and his work               should set an example which may be applied in other parts of the                world. Finally, the project will assist in the training of a                    promising young scientist.",
