 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principal Investigator will travel to London for a week to             xerox the clinical growth records of the primates at the London                 Zoo, which is closing.  The records may well become unavailable or              lost at that time.  The proposers will to transfer the records to               their primate growth data base and to analyze them within the                   framework of their continuing study of the development of sexual                dimorphism in different primate species.                                                                                                                             This is a timely and important project.  Sexual dimorphism is              once again an interesting topic in evolutionary studies, and it is              being tied to different mating strategies or alternatively,                     different diets.  It is also clear that the development of sexual               dimorphism (its timing during growth, etc.) is an important dynamic             that has not been adequately addressed, where most often the focus              has been on adult animals.",
