 "awd_abstract_narration": "9310699  Jacob  The relationship between science and commerce plays a crucial but  little understood role in modern society.  For much of its  existence as a nation, for example, US entrepreneurs \"imported\"  scientific work from European nations to use in the development of  American industry.  Currently, Japanese entrepreneurs are said to  be taking advantage of scientific and technological knowledge  produced in the US and Europe.  But how do entrepreneurs take  advantage of scientific developments in order to establish  commercially profitable technological enterprises?  One way to get  at this critical question is to examine the historical record. This  is what Professor Margaret Jacob is doing.     Professor Jacob, working with six to eight graduate student  research assistants over the three years of this grant, is  continuing her study of the cultural foundations of Western  industrialization.  Her goal is to show the dynamic interaction of  industrial culture with political and economic realities within  national and comparative contexts.  The nations she is comparing  are Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium (then the Austrian  Netherlands).  She is undertaking a study of the cultural history  of the Industrial Revolution that factors scientific and  technological knowledge into a complex picture of the values,  attitudes and beliefs that permitted industrialization to occur.   Her model depends upon the techniques of the cultural historian  trained in the history of science and technology.  The focus of  this research -- to be conducted in three languages in libraries  and archives of Wales, Birmingham, Manchester, Paris, Troyes,  Brussels, Mons, Rotterdam and the Hague -- is the actors in the  industrialization process: entrepreneurs, agents of governments,  members of scientific societies, scientific lecturers, and  engineers, most in their home countries, a few as foreign travelers  seeking to sell or buy (or steal!) skills and knowledge.  ***",
