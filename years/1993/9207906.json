 "awd_abstract_narration": "This upgrade of computing facilities will allow the W.K.                        Kellogg Biological         Station of Michigan State                            University to realize more effectively its mission of                           reserch on living systems and resources.  The upgrade will                      allow the station to         continue to function as a                          regional and national center of excellence in ecological                        research, stimulate collaborative research, and permit more                     extensive use of the         considerable investment and                        resources which the Station represents.  The present                            computing system is inadequate to meet these functions; it                      is aging, overloaded,         prone to failure and is a                         bottleneck to research productivity.  The principal                             achievements of the upgrade will be to increase system                          reliability, capacity, and         support, and to allow                        further development of the maintenance of local and wide                        area networking.  The award will provide new shared                             facilities which cannot be         managed by individual                        laboratories or investigators and - an improved network                         infrastructure which is required to support this upgraded                       system.  It will also permit         the Station to continue                    to assist other field stations in developing data management                    capability.                                                                     * * *",
