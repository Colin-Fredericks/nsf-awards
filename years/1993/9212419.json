 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year research project which has as its                     purpose the study of computationally intensive methods in                       classification (pattern recognition) and regression (noisy                      prediction) where the data is high-dimensional and nonlinear.                   The research involves new approaches to binary tree structured                  methods, with the goal of significantly improving on the accuracy               and flexiblity of the present, widely used tree structured                      methods initiated by the book and software presented by Breiman                 et. al. (1984).                                                                      The advances in methodology will be useful in the many and                 diverse areas that make use of classification and prediction.                   Current areas of interest including speech recognition, image                   processing, medical diagnosis, and handwritten and printed                      charactor recognition.                                                               There will be five areas of concentration.  Two of these are               based on recent work by Breiman (1991) for efficiently fitting                  very high dimensional noisy data by continuously joined                         hyperplane segments.  Similar algorithms will be used to                        construct trees by fitting hyperplanes in the nodes, and by using               multivariate \"ramp\" functions to construct continuous                           approximations to prediction surfaces.                                               The other three areas include a promising method for                       optimizing trees, making them multi-step optimal instead in one-                step at present, hyperplane splitting for multiple response trees               and a new method for doing penalized linear prediction.  This                   latter method, called Bridge Regression, offers hope of providing               uniformly better prediction than ordinary least squares.",
