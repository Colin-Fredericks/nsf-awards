 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351686  Blount  Recent advances in computing hardware and software have, for  the first time, brought massive numbers of earth and space-  derived data sets into the realm of undergraduate instruction.  Affordable storage and image-manipulation hardware coupled with  user-friendly analysis software for scientific visualization  are the major advances.  In addition, the rapid expansion of  regional supercomputing centers and ubiquitous networks have  led to computing facility surpluses which now allow  undergraduate students access to computing time previously  reserved for graduate and post-graduate researchers.  To  address these realities, we are developing an interdisciplinary  earth and planetary science teaching curricula centered on  coordination between formerly disparate academic departments.   To spearhead this effort, we have formed the Earth System  Science Institute (ESSI), which includes the departments of  Space Studies, Geography, and Geology.  A networked  undergraduate imaging laboratory is being established for  training of undergraduate earth and planetary science students  in the emerging fields of scientific visualization of  multispatial and multitemporal data sets.  Individual graphics  workstations are being networked to a Cray X-MP supercomputer.  The coupled hardware system is capable of both acquiring and  analyzing a suite of in-situ and space-derived data sets  including the high-resolution (1 km) multiband imaging data  sets of the NOAA AVHRR sensors acquired by our newly installed  satellite ground station.  The curricula includes exercises in  data acquisition, data visualization, scientific programming,  information extraction and computer modeling. Undergraduates  exposed to these curricula will be well prepared to deal with  the plethora of earth and planetary data to be generated as a  part of the International Global Change Research Program in the  next decade and beyond.  ***",
