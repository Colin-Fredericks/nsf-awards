 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to develop a closed loop                  control system for induction plasma deposition in order to  improve             manufactured material quality and also expand the                               processing capabilities.  Such a system will also provide new                   capabilities to examine the structure/performance relations                     achievable by plasma deposition.  The research is focused on the                following areas: 1) experimental verification of a low order model              of the process and its refinement, 2) development of control                    structure, control implementation, and preliminary                              processing/materials property studies, and 3) extension to related              systems.                                                                             Plasma torches are used to melt and accelerate metallic and/or             ceramic particles in order to form dense coatings at high                       production rates.  Plasma deposition is used in a variety of                    different applications including corrosion, thermal and wear                    resistance coatings, near net shape manufacture, and production of              metal matrix composites.  Successful modeling and control of the                process will reduce variations in material quality in induction                 plasma deposition processes.",
