 "awd_abstract_narration": "The novel design of this new ultra-high resolution                         photoemission system will give an energy and angular resolution of              better than 5 meV and 0.2 degrees, respectively.  The 5 meV                     resolution is about a factor of 4-5 times better than most current              state of the art spectrometers.  The 0.2 degrees angular resolution             is about a factor of 10 times better than the typical angle-                    resolved photoemission spectrometer.  Most importantly, the                     analyzer enables one to simultaneously acquire 80 spectra at                    different angles in the time it would normally take to acquire one              spectrum with a conventional spectrometer.  In addition, the large              analyzer size also dramatically enhances the efficiency of the                  spectrometer.  This means that the new spectrometer will have a                 total counting rate at least 100 times better than the best                     spectrometer in the field now.  This equipment will be used for a               variety or research programs at Stanford University.  It will also              be made available to researchers from other institutions.                            The successful implementation of this system will have a very              positive impact on many exciting areas of research on advanced                  materials.  This includes the high-temperature superconductors,                 semiconductors, the fullerenes and their derivatives, magnetic                  materials, the Mott insulators, and heavy fermion and mixed valence             compounds.  Some of the key issues in contemporary physics will be              very effectively addressed by the extremely high energy and angular             resolution made available by the new spectrometer.  Examples                    include the superconducting gap in cuprates and the Kondo resonance             in heavy fermions.  Acquisition of this system will greatly enhance             ongoing and future research, as well as the educational environment             at Stanford University and other institutions.",
