 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to study the petrogenesis of mantle                          eclogites and the dynamics of their emplacement within the                      framework of the evolution of ancient sub-cratonic mantle                       and the early evolution of the Earth.  In this proposed                         research, work concerning two localities  will continue, and                    study extended to two additional kimberlite localities in                       Yakutia, Siberia.  These occurrences are postulated to have                     sampled a wide range of depths in the mantle and are                            situated at varying distances from the craton edge.  The                        proposed study would continue the NSF-sponsored US/Russia                       Cooperative Research Program and agreement between Prof.                        L.A. Taylor of the University of Tennessee and Academician                      N.V.  Sobolev of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy                     of Sciences.  This multi-national approach will include                         petrographic and mineral-chemical analyses of selected                          xenoliths from the aforementioned kimberlite pipes in                           Siberia.  This study will include an exchange of scientific                     personnel between the United States and Russia.  O, Rb-Sr,                      Sm-Nd, and Re-Os analyses will be performed on mineral                          separates in diamonds to determine the involvement of mantle                    and crustal reservoirs in eclogite genesis.  A new and                          exciting direction involves a study of major- and trace-                        element chemistry of eclogite minerals found in several of                      the Yakutian diamonds.  The results will be used to achieve                     a more complete and global picture of the formation of                          mantle eclogites, the structure and evolution of old                            cratons, and the differentiation of the early Earth.",
