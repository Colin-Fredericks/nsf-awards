 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential use of                  formal program derivation techniques in the design of critical (yet             reasonable-sized) components of concurrent systems.  Several                    technical issues will be addressed.  The notion of program                      specification will be extended to include not only a behavior                   specification but also formally specified constraints, e.g., the                characteristics of the target architecture.  The formally stated                constraints will provide additional formal guidance to the design               process and will lead to the emergence of new program derivation                methods.  The formal component of this research will be                         complemented by experimentation with a number of case studies                   ranging from simple problems having popular appeal in the                       literature to real components selected in cooperation with an                   industrial partner.                                                                                                                                             Successful use of formal derivation techniques on industrial-grade              problems will require a careful blend of formal methods and                     practical insights.  Regarding the latter, experience to date                   suggests two particularly promising ideas to evaluate.  First, is               the notion of freeing much of the design process from costly formal             proofs without compromising the disciplined thinking typical of                 formal derivation.  Second, is the idea of providing powerful                   visual exploration, communication, and prototyping capabilities                 supplied by an already developed state-of-the art program                       visualization facility.",
