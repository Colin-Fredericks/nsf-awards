 "awd_abstract_narration": "There currently exists a huge literature on campaign contributions              and spending in legislative elections; and there likewise exists a              substantial literature on lobbying activities given an elected                  legislature.  Most of this work is empirical and descriptive, but               there is a growing theoretical literature that attempts to provide              more general explanations for the empirical findings.  For the most             part, this theoretical work has treated the giving of campaign                  contributions and lobbying as the same activity, yet a main theme               in the descriptive accounts is that contributions are made to                   secure access to the recipient in order to lobby, conditional on                the recipient being electorally successful.  The current                        investigation develops a theory that explicitly integrates both                 campaign contributions and lobbying, considered in informational                terms.                                                                                                                                                          The essential idea is that lobbying is predominantly an                         informational activity.  Legislators have to make decisions on                  issues about which they often know relatively little.  Interest                 groups, however, are frequently well-informed about the                         consequences of particular legislation for their particular                     interests; consequently, legislators would like to become informed              by listening to lobbyists.  Unfortunately, interest groups have                 little incentive to say anything about an issue that might hurt                 their cause, and so there is a non trivial problem for the                      legislator in disentangling useful information from the case any                lobbyist might present.  In view of this, some lobbyists are likely             to be more informative than others for a given legislator.  This                could be because some lobbyists' interests are more closely allied              with those of the legislator and so can be expected to offer                    information on which lobbyists are likely to be more valuable to                the legislator; in general, one expects that interest groups that               have most to gain from being able to talk to a legislator and make              their case on an issue will be those that are willing to give the               most in contributions.  Thus higher contributions might signal to               a legislator which groups are likely to prove most important for                that legislator during the legislative session.                                                                                                                 Important issues for the research are:  (1) identification of the               circumstances in which we can expect the informational role of                  contributions to be more important than the purely reelection role;             (2) description of the extent to which the access role of                       contributions leads to \"bias\" in legislative decision making as a               whole; and, (3) exploration of how details of the legislative                   decision making process affect the incentives for donors and                    recipients.",
