The papers will consider  different questions and provide a provocative and creative,  yet scholarly, basis for the conference.  Each author will  present his or her ideas in a short, editorial-length paper.   The authors for these editorials will not be from major  curriculum-development groups.  The papers will be  distributed prior to the conference and included in the  monograph.  Figure 1 displays potential topics and authors  for these commissioned papers.    Representatives from both national and local curriculum-  development groups also will prepare short editorials on  their respective organizations and the priorities, changes,  and projections for the next decade.  In particular, they  will address (1) their long-range organizational plans, (2)  their responses to the standards-based reform, (3) the  factors that facilitate and inhibit curriculum development,  and the issues and problems they expect in the next decade.   Figures 2 and 3 display the proposed authors and  organizations.  ***",
