 "awd_abstract_narration": "9313672  Marcus    Populations of Calanus finmarchicus constitute a major portion of  the zooplankton biomass in the Northwestern Atlantic, and comprise  a fundamental food source for the cod and haddock that live on  Georges Bank.  The springtime arrival of this copepod on the Bank  is reportedly due to recruitment of fifth stage copepodites from  the deeper waters of the Gulf of Maine, where they overwinter in a  state of dormancy or diapause.  Recruitment success depends, to a  large extent, on the duration of this diapause stage.  Knowing the  effects of environmental factors on the timing of diapause  induction and termination, and the internal morphological changes  that occur throughout this critical life stage, will contribute to  a better understanding of the physical and biological factors that  regulate the recruitment process of Calanus finmarchicus onto  Georges Bank.  The research to be conducted under this project is  an in-depth investigation of ways in which variations of  temperature and photoperiod may influence the physiological  processes that control and regulate diapause in Calanus  finmarchicus.  A specially designed system for culturing multiple  generations of C. finmarchicus will be used to subject the juvenile  stages to various combinations of temperature and photoperiod.  Light microscopy and TEM will be used to confirm the identity of  the cue-receptive organs and neuroendocrine sites that control the  cessation and induction of molting.  Cytological features of gonad  development in diapausing and nondiapausing individuals will be  described and compared in both laboratory and field populations.  ***",
