 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a two-year collaborative research project                   between Max Cooper, M.D., of the University of Alabama at                       Birmingham and Professor Takeshi Watanabe of Kyushu University.  on             the analysis of the function of the surface antigen BP-1/6C3                    expressed on mouse hematopoietic cells (mostly B-lymphocytes) and               analysis of its possible influence on B-lineage differentiation.                Cell surface proteins expressed by developing B lymphocyte                      precursors are involved in regulatory interactions with other cell              types in hemopoietic tissues that help orchestrate this entire                  process.  The antigen identified by the BP-1 antibody is a good                 candidate for this type of function since its expression is                     restricted to early B-lineage cells, and it may modulate their                  proliferation.  BP-1 is a cell surface metallopeptidase,                        animopeptidase A (APA).  To determine the function of APA in B cell             development, two strategies will be followed.  First, transgenic                mice expressing APA driven by the immunoglobulin heavy chain                    promoter and enhancer will be constructed.  Study of this                       transgenic mouse model will permit the determination of the effect              of prolinged expression of APA beyond the early B cell stage where              its expression is normally extinguished.  An alternate informative              approach will be to disrupt the APA gene by homologous                          recombination.  Since BP-1/APA is expressed in a variety of tissues             outside of the homopoietic lineage, these \"knockout\" mice should                also help to define the necessity for and function of this enzyme               in other systems.                                                                                                                                               The expertise of the U.S. and Japanese groups is complementary and              collaboration has been in progress for several years.  Dr. Cooper's             group has made appropriate monoclonal antibodies, cloned the                    corresponding c-DNA, and established its aminopeptidase A activity.             Dr. Watanabe's group is well known for their expertise in molecular             biology, particularly in the area of B cell gene expression.",
