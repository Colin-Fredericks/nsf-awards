Respondents will be solicited via advertisements in newspapers and posted in community meeting places and contact with local agencies such as the Red Cross and mental health services.  Responses will be gathered via telphone and mail surveys, interviews, written narratives about their losses, and diary record keeping from approximately 200 280 people living in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Wisconsin.  The subjects will reflect diversity in age, gender, race, socio economic status, urban rural home location, and occupation  and who have experiences different kinds of loss as a result of the flooding.  Subjects will include farmers, small business owners, non farmer/non business persons who were forced out of their homes by the flooding. A baseline comparison group will be people who lived in the region during the floods but who did not experience the loss of substantial physical property, jobs or income.  During the next year, archival data will be gathered to assess the possible relationshops between people's experience of the flooding and the occurrences of events such as divorce, bankruptcy, and mental health visits.",
