 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Professor James H. Power of Louisiana State                 University to collaborate in marine biology research with Professor             Henk W. van der Veer of the Netherlands Institute for Sea Research              (NIOZ).  The objective of their research is to obtain an innovative             and comprehensive set of key measurements on individual fish larvae             that will fully characterize the animal's size-specific growth as               well as the response of these measures to different food levels.                They will obtain the typical values of these measurements in                    cultured populations of plaice larvae, and evaluate their observed              distributions, variability and the strengths of their relationships             to one another.  NIOZ staff has experience and special facilities               for culturing plaice larvae for use in their own ongoing research.              Dr. Power brings special apparatus and techniques that he has                   developed for determining larval mass, body volume, and                         morphometrics.  Both groups will be involved in the data analysis               and interpretation.                                                                                                                                             This research addresses one of the very important objectives of                 marine biological research:  understanding how various biological               and environmental factors affect the abundance of a given marine                population. The joint research will identify baseline development               patterns that are expected to be significant in field studies of                population recruitment.  In addition, it may provide indicators for             identifying especially healthy or stressed individuals and for                  predicting continued survival.",
