 "awd_abstract_narration": "9352734  Shor   An industrial-standard control laboratory with reconfigurable  real-time VME-bus-based architecture is being established for  undergraduate control engineering instruction.The motivation  for this novel proposed laboratory setup is to make the setting  both flexible for individual project design and accessible from  remote sites. The flexibility of the  architecture  permits  multiple projects to be developed and tested concurrently  without interfering with each other. The VME-bus architecture  allows the projects to share VME-bus devices such as data-  acquisition boards and real-time controllers. Further, since  the equipment is accessible from the network, students may  develop their software and algorithms from remote sites and  take advantage of available network resources. This also makes  the proposed laboratory accessible to persons who are disabled.  The extensive video network  together with the network  accessibility of the laboratory, provides interactive  demonstration capabilities for laboratory-classroom  instruction. This contributes to the effort to develop  decentralized classroom technology.The laboratory  provides  reliable, modern, industrial-quality equipment to familiarize  the student with the current industrial standards. This quality  setup  enables the students to focus on the challenges of  controlling non-ideal dynamical systems and to experiment with  innovative ideas. A sequence of experiments is designed to  improve student understanding of the basic principles and  challenges of digital control.   ***",
