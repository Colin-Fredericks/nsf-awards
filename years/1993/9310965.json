 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the most exciting technical advances in neurobiology have               come from the field of genetic engineering.  It is now possible to              selectively \"knock out\" single genes and examine their effect on                behavior.  Knock-out mice, as they are called, have been used to                probe the circuits underlying learning and memory, temperature                  adaptation, and many other behaviors.  They provide highly                      selective probes for elucidating the long mysterious connection                 between genes and behavior.  Dr. Fremeau has recently cloned the                gene for a high-affinity membrane transporter for proline.  The                 fact that these uptake systems for proline are found in selective               populations of glutaminergic nerve terminals suggests that proline              is a novel neurotransmitter which modifies glutaminergic                        transmission in some way.  Since glutamate is a major transmitter               in cerebral cortex and involved in mechanisms of neuroplasticity,               it is obviously of great interest to determine proline's role in                glutaminergic function.  This NSF small grant for exploratory                   research (SGER) will give Dr. Fremeau the chance to use genetic                 engineering techniques to solve this problem.  He will attempt the              high-risk/high gain task of producing a knock out mouse that lacks              this membrane component.  If he succeeds it will be possible to                 determine the role that proline neurotransmission plays in the                  development of behavior.  This is the kind of research for which                the SGER was designed for there are few other funding mechanisms                for supporting research that does not have a fairly assured                     payoff.***//",
