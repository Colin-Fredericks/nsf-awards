 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seminars on this topic were held at Cornell University in 1983 and              1987, with 118 participants and 55 papers presented in 1983, and                367 participants from 26 countries and 177 papers presented in                  1987.  This reflects, in part, the growing worldwide interest in                research to better understand the problems of student (and teacher)             misconceptions, and educational strategies to address the problems,             In the six years our last seminar, much new work has been done and              interest in the topic by researchers and teachers has increased.                The proposed seminar will include some 150-200 papers presented in              parallel sessions and four late afternoon plenary sessions dealing              with:  (1) definition and understanding of misconceptions (or                   alterative conceptions); (2) epistemological issues underlying the              remediation of conceptions; (3) metacognitive strategies to                     facilitate overcoming misconceptions; and (4) teacher education                 considerations and teaching strategies to deal with misconceptions.             Funding is requested for honoraria, travel, and per diem for four               plenary session leaders (who will also prepare summary reports),                for hourly clerical and student support, and to partially fund                  production of the Proceedings.  We expect the Seminar Proceedings               will be available within 60 days (as for previous seminars) in both             print and electronic forms.",
