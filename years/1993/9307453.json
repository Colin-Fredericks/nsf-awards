The Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) study                     established the technical basis for proceeding with the Phase II                research by demonstrating that it is possible to develop a                      working game that entails the combination of a well-designed                    intelligent tutoring system rooted in cognitive psychology with a               game format.  The objectives of the Phase II research focus on                  (1) filling in and experimentally testing the Phase I Intelligent               Tutoring Game (ITG) framework in order to provide feedback as to                the soundness of the teaching concepts upon which the framework                 of the project is based; and (2) developing and experimentally                  testing a full-scale ITG for middle school probability and                      statistics/scientific reasoning in order to assess the soundness                of implementing the instructional approach of the project in an                 ITG format.  The project aims to provide the students using the                 software with the benefits of individualized instruction in a                   game environment that maintains student interest and enthusiasm.                                                                                                While there exist games that are poor tutors and tutors that are                poor games, i.e., they are no fun, the proposed project would                   fill this gap by developing a research-based framework to develop               tutors that excel both from instructional and enjoyment                         perspectives.",
