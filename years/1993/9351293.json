 "awd_abstract_narration": "9351293  Edwards  A long-term goal of Texas Southern University's Department of  Biology is to develop and maintain a modern and well equipped  molecular biology teaching laboratory that provides state-of-  the-art training opportunities for undergraduate students who  intend to pursue careers in health science fields, including  teaching, research, and medicine. This application requests  funds to purchase micro and high-speed centrifuges, equipment  for organelle isolation and genome analysis for teaching a  laboratory course in \"Experimentation in Recombinant DNA  Technology, Genome Analysis, and Cell Mapping\" to supplement  and clarify the theory taught in Cell and Molecular Biology  courses. The laboratory experience is mandatory in preparing  minority students for graduate and professional schools, and  for careers in college and precollege teaching.  The new  equipment will allow students to develop experience in the  preparation of plasmids and plasmid DNA, fractionation of  subcellular organelles and preparation of genomic and Lambda  DNA; to amplify DNA molecules for sequencing and cloning in  plasmid vectors, and produce libraries of genomic DNA; to  isolate Restriction Enzyme digests, separate DNA fragments,  isolate chromosome-size DNA molecules, sequence cloned DNA  fragments and DNA isolated directly from agarose gels. Not only  is this equipment essential for teaching the proposed  laboratory course, it will also provide a facility for training  other undergraduate students in state-of-the-art methods in  biochemical and molecular biology procedures.  ***",
