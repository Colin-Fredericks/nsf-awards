 "awd_abstract_narration": "Snake venom is a store-house of numerous bioreactive proteins.             These proteins are enzymes, toxins and may be growth factors.                   Venoms from several species of snakes in concentrations from 100 to             6.25 ug/ml were tested on primary culture of mouse kidney and                   spleen cells and established PC-12 cell cultures. Venoms from all               tested species of snakes were found to be cytolytic, except for                 Crotalus atrox and Oxyuranus scutellatus, which showed growth                   proliferative effects on these cell cultures.                                        The venom of C. atrox was studied further. The growth of                   primary cultures in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)              was equivalent to the growth obtained in serum free medium,                     containing 50 to 25 ug/ml crude venom. The growth of PC-12 cells                was accelerated tremendously in serum free medium supplemented with             venom. Thus, it is apparent that snake venom contains a cell growth             factor.                                                                              Snake venom derived growth factor (SVGF) will be isolated in               purity from the venom of C. atrox by HPLC or isoelectric                        electrophoresis. Each fraction will be tested for growth on PC-12               cells. The fraction showing a cell growth effect will be tested on              variety of cell lines and with different media.                                      Proposed research will lead to a novel cell growth factor,                 which will replace the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in cell                  cultures. Use of  SVGF may be extended to grow epithelial cells                 from burn victim for creating autograph.",
