 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator will analyze the qualitative                    behavior of solutions to several partial differential equations                 arising in the theory of phase transitions.  Of particular                      interest are the Cahn-Hilliard, Hele-Shaw, and Phase field                      equations.  The structure of the set of equilibria for each model               will also be discussed.  Techniques involve the theories of                     singular perturbations, invariant manifolds, and spectral                       analysis for differential operators as well as classical                        estimates for solutions of partial differential equations.                           This project is concerned with several mathematical problems               associated with phase transitions in solids.  In this context                   different phases of a nonhomogeneous material are distinguished                 by different concentrations of their components.  The                           mathematical equations involved in this project also arise in                   many other areas of science and geometry and therefore it is                    expected that results here will have far-reaching effects.  Among               the phenomena addressed by the principal investigators are the                  spontaneous creation of a fine-grained structure, nucleation                    whereby widely separated particles undergo rapid growth, and                    coarsening of the micro structure of the material.  All of these                phenomena have significance with respect to material properties                 such as the brittleness and superconductivity of an alloy or                    ceramic.",
