We are orgainizing a  second workshop for these two communities to discuss experiment,  simulations, and theory of common interest.  The subjects chosen will emphasize areas where progress is being  made both in the laboratory and space.  These include topics such  as: Critical Velocity, Reconnection, Ion Cyclotron Waves, Beam  Drive Instabilities, Anomalous Resistivity, Double Layers,  Collisionless Shocks, Non-linear and Kinetic alfven Waves, Active  Space Experiments, Turbulence and Transport.  The need for these two communities to interact more closely has  already been recognized by the AGU which held a 1 day special  session at the December 1990 AGU Meeting.  We also held a  successful meeting in Alpbach, Austria July 1-6, 1991.  Our meeting  will occupy 5 days in a setting where all participants will eat  together and be housed nearby.  In this manner we can expect both  a more extended and more intense synergistic interaction between  the participants than the AGU meeting will offer.    There will be two sessions each day.  Each session will begin with  invited speakers and will continue with contributed papers.  Poster  papers will also be included if the response warrants this  approach.  We expect that the attendees will be primairly  specialist from2 the laboratory and space communities.  Some  advanced graduate students will also attend.  ***",
