 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goals of this research are: (1) to study the kinetics and             regulation of anion and cation transport in single erythroblastic               cells during differentiation and maturation using the technique of              x-ray microanalysis, and to investigate the effect of                           erythropoietic stimulating factors and cofactors in modulating                  these changes.  (2) to demonstrate the applicability of this                    technique in investigating transport of materials labelled with                 identifiable elements such as platinum, iodine or bromine in a                  multi-compartment system. (3) to better understand and improve the              technique of cryosectioning for preparation of samples for x-ray                microanalysis.  Investigation of membrane transport of the                      erythroid cells in the bone marrow is complicated by the                        heterogeneity of the cell population.  Without physical separation              of the cells into distinct homogeneous populations conventional                 radioisotopic tracer methods for measuring transport cannot be                  applied.  The techniques of cryomicrotomy and x-ray microanalysis               provide a solution to this problem.  Changes in sodium potassium                chloride as well as rubidium and bromide uptake in individual                   erythroid cells from sheep, dog and rabbit at various stages of                 maturation will be studied.  The different species of animals                   selected have different gene expressions in their red cell membrane             transport properties.  Relationships among morphological changes,               membrane transport alteration and hemoglobin production during                  maturation will be studied.  Pump/leak, cotransport and counter                 transport systems will be examined by multielemental analysis.  In              addition, the maturational transport characteristics of an                      erythroid progenitor cell type from the spleen of mice infected                 with Friend's virus will be studied to examine the effect of                    erythropoietin on the changes in membrane transport function and                hemoglobin production.  These cells can be obtained inadequately                large quantity and can survive in culture to allow for transport                measurement using radioisotopic tracers as well as x-ray                        microanalysis.  Finally this project includes a section where we                will try to better understand the cryosectioning technique and                  extend the application of x-ray microanalysis to the study of                   uptake and intracellular distribution of larger labeled molecules               in bone marrow cells.                                                           %%%                                                                             One of the fundamental properties of living cells is their ability              to control their internal salt content and composition by                       controlling the passage of inorganic ions across their membranes.               This is important because different salts play different                        physiological roles in different cells at different developmental               stages.  This research uses a sophisticated technique known as                  electron probe x-ray microanalysis to study the inorganic salt                  content of individual, identified cells as visualized by the                    electron microscope.  The cell type and its stage of maturity can               be determined and correlated with its salt content.  This                       information can be used to deduce the ion transport mechanisms at               work.  This research will contribute to the basic understanding of              biological ion transport processes.***//",
