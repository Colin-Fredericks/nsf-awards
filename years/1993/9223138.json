 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to plan, control and predict software  processes is facilitated by the measurement of software  development artifacts, even though construction of  quantitative models from these artifacts is a difficult task.  Explanatory variables are potentially numerous and  heterogeneous; data sets are replete with outliers; the  quality of the data collection may be questionable; and often  only partial information is available for building the model.  Even so, there is a need for customized modelling techniques,  procedures, and tools to facilitate the construction of local  tools within a specific development environment.  Stochastic modelling is needed for three kinds of  activity within the development process:  planning, monitoring  and control, and post-mortem analysis and evaluation.  Models  are used to enable managers to plan and to take corrective  actions to meet budget, schedule and quality requirements.  This research is aimed at continuing the development of  an approach called Optimized Set Reduction with the aim of  addressing the specific constraints and needs of software  engineering.",
