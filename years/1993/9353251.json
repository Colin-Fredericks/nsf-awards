The goals set by this project are to significantly increase the  participation and commitment of minority students in the sciences,  and to heighten the level of awareness of students with potential  careers in science and mathematics, including school teaching.    Forty eight minority students from underrepresented and  disadvantages groups, who have completed their 7th and 8th grades,  will be eligible to attend the camp.  Recruitment will be from the  state of New Jersey, based on \"need\" and interest in the field of  science, mathematics and engineering.    The summer session of Camp PROMISE will be the key component, and  consist of three inter-related components: a) an enrichment  apprenticeship component, where students will be assigned as  apprentices to faculty/scientists for a week at a time; b) a  remedial academic component which will offer classes in mathematics  and English) a cultural resident component where participants will  room and board on campus during the week.  The program will  operation weekdays only.  The academic year component will have two  follow-up meeting, one in Fall 1993 and the other in Spring 1994.    Portfolio assessment of students' progress using lab books, and  other daily lesson plan data will be primarily anecdotal and  qualitative.  However, student attitude test will be analyzed and  the progress of the student monitored by selected teachers.    A broad range of participatory activities, not experienced in  school classrooms, will help bring the \"wonder\" of science and  encourage students to select science courses at high school.  The  ultimate aim is to influence minority students to make academic  preparat ions in middle and high school so as to be able to make  career choices in the are of science, engineering and mathematics.   Funding for this program is therefore solicited.",
