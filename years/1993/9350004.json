 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current reform efforts in mathematics education call for changing               patterns of classroom discourse to ones that foster students                    thinking and problem solving, and that more closely resemble                    discourse used among mathematicians.  Yet classroom discourse has               proven highly resistant to change.  One reason for this resistance              may be a lack of concrete examples, i.e., classrooms in which                   desirable patterns of discourse are actually used.  Japanese                    classrooms may provide us with just such a set of examples.                     Although no in-depth studies exist of Japanese classroom discourse,             prior work by the Principal Investigator and colleagues suggests                that discourse in Japanese classrooms may conform closely to                    recommendations contained in the NCTM Professional Standards.  The              goal of this study is to evaluate this suggestion, and to determine             the extent to which American reform efforts might be aided by                   empirical descriptions of Japanese classroom discourse.                                                                                                         The project proposed will be completed in 6 steps:  (1) Existing                videotapes tapes of 160 classroom mathematics lessons-half from the             United States- will be transcribed, translated, and entered into a              multimedia database that coordinates the verbal transcriptions with             the video; (2) Tools for analyzing the tapes in order to                        characterize and compare classroom discourse in Japan and the                   United States will be developed and applied; (3) Using the analyses             from Step 2, classroom discourse in Japan will be examined in light             of the NCTM standards and other current reform documents the focus              on talk in the mathematics classroom; (4) In those cases where                  Japanese classrooms are judged to exemplify ideal patterns of                   discourse, tasks, materials, and techniques used by Japanese                    teachers to achieve these patterns will be identified; (5)                      Exploratory research will be conducted in collaboration with                    American teachers to investigate the usefulness of Japanese                     techniques in American classrooms; (6) Results of the project will              be disseminated in both written reports and video presentations,                and the full multimedia database will be made available to other                researchers.",
