 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heidelberg College Physics Department has used the camcorder                    and VCR to conduct introductory physics laboratories during the                 past 2 years.  The advantage of video in the physics lab is                     that it has enabled students to study \"real world\" events.                      Overall the use of video has been excellent; however, the                       process of collecting and analyzing data using a VCR and                        monitor requires an exorbitant amount of time.  In order to                     make the video system more effective at helping students learn                  physics, Heidelberg College requested funding for 6 computer                    workstations (MacintoshTM computer, laboratory probe interface,                 software, and a video-digitizing board).The computer                            workstations, combined with already existing video equipment,                   are being used to conduct experiments in the areas of                           kinematics, dynamics, momentum, angular motion, and energy.                     The video-taped motion can be shown on the computer's monitor                   when played through a video-digitizing board.  The video can be                 converted into a digitized movie or played \"live.\"  The                         playback speed of the images can be controlled, thereby                         allowing the student, with the appropriate software, to carry                   out measurements using a \"mouse.\"  The collected data can be                    linked to a graphing or spreadsheet program for the student to                  carry out further analysis.The power of the video/computer                      workstation is that it allows the student to quickly and                        efficiently observe and quantify events that cannot be done at                  the laboratory bench. The workstations allow the students to                    fully utilize the advantages of the video system by eliminating                 the drudgery of collecting data from a video tape.  This                        enables the students to spend more time learning the physics.",
