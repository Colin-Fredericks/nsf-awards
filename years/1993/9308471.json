 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research has three components: (a) The study of               direct and inverse problems for acoustic pulse reflection from                  randomly layered media, (b) the study of the focusing singularity               of the nonlinear Schroedinger and related equations, and (c)                    convection enhanced diffusion. In pulse reflection a statistical                theory will be developed for reflected signals generated by                     pulses emitted by a point source located on the surface or above                a randomly layered half space.  The range of validity of the                    theory, based on the asymptotic theory of stochastic equations,                 will be explored with numerical simulations.  For pulsed plane                  waves incident on a randomly layered half space, a number of                    statistical inverse problems will be formulated and solved, where               properties of the medium are based on the statistics of the                     observed reflected signals.                                                          The work on pulse reflection is of direct interest in                      exploration seismology and to a lesser extent in connection with                the detection of seismic events that are natural or man-made.                   The work on the nonlinear Schroedinger equation is useful in                    nonlinear optics for laser surgery, for example, and in laser                   fusion.  The work on convection-diffusion is useful in the study                of dispersion of pollutants in various environments such as the                 ocean and the atmosphere.",
