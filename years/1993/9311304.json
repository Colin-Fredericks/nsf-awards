As a major source of   Atrina mortality, the gastropod should influence shelter availability, and thus   indirectly affect species occupying the shells. Since the fish also use the shells   as a site for reproduction, the gastropod predator may influence both population   distribution and egg production. This study will assess the relationship between   Atrina and each fish species by experimentally varying pen shell mortality rates,   and separately measuring factors that should influence Atrina mortality, namely   abundance and individual feeding rates of the gastropod predator.  %%%  This information will allow a quantitative evaluation of the interaction between   the predator and the fish occupants in terms of local abundance and   reproductive output. Understanding how interspecific interactions influence   populations and communities has been a major goal of ecological research.   Direct predator-prey and competitive interactions are widely studied. Indirect   interactions have received less attention, but evidence for their importance is   growing. This study will contribute important information towards a better   understanding of the role of indirect interactions in the abundance and   distribution of aquatic organisms.  ***",
