 "awd_abstract_narration": "9305498  Silliker       These experiments will determine the pattern of inheritance of  mitochondrial genomes in the acellular slime mold Didymiym iridis  (Ditmar) Fries (class Myxomycetes).  The mitochondrial DNA of one  strain of D. iridis will be characterized by cloning and  restriction enzyme mapping.  Mitochondrial DNA variation will be  assessed within strains of the largest heterothallic interbreeding  group by comparison of probe hybridization patterns between  strains.  Once probes diagnostic for a mitochondrial type are  identified they will be used to follow the fate of mitochondria in  crosses.  The results will be interpreted with special attention to  the probable relatedness of these strains based on mitochondrial  restriction fragment length polymorphism, geographical origin, and  nuclear isozyme and mating type data.  Uniparental organelle  inheritance is an emerging rule for organelle behavior.   Transmittance patterns are a result of unequal parental  contribution (anisogamy) or mating type control in isogamous  organisms with binary mating systems.  Heterothallic myxomycetes  have multiple-allelic mating systems.  The pattern of mitochondrial  inheritance in the myxomycete Physarum polycephalum was found to be  determined by a mating type hierarchy.  Preliminary evidence  suggests that this is not the case with D. iridis.  When compatible  strains (different mating types) were crossed, about half the  individuals inherited one mitochondrial type and half the other  type.  Replicate crosses with ten strains will be made in all  possible combinations and the pattern of mitochondrial inheritance  will be determined by hybridization of strain diagnostic probes to  DNA samples from individuals.  %%%  Determining the pattern of mitochondrial transmittance in Didymium  should allow development of hypotheses about the mechanism of  inheritance.  One working hypothesis predicts that mitochondrial  inheritance will be more tightly regulated in closely related  strains.  The results of  this research could be of major importance  to evolutionary genetics.  The involvement of undergraduate  students in the project will be beneficial to the training of  molecular geneticists.  ***",
