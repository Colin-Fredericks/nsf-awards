Wrighton of the Chemistry Department, Massachusetts                 Institute of Technology.  This investigation is concerned with                  the photochemistry and electrochemistry of organometallic                       molecules attached to surfaces.  Four studies will be pursued:                  (1) the rate and stability of attachment of various functional                  groups to metal surfaces; (2) the photochemistry of                             surface-confined organometallic molecules; (3) the chemistry of                 metal complexes with redox-active pendant groups that can be                    used to \"tune\" the reactivity of the metal center; and (4)                      synthesis and characterization of metal complexes which show                    reversible electrochemical response and can be attached to                      metal surfaces.  In study (1), particular attention will be                     paid to platinum, gold, and indium/tin oxide surfaces which are                 useful as microelectrodes.  Manganese carbonyl compounds which                  are photosensitive and can exchange multiple CO groups will be                  used in study (2), as will some ruthenium ammine and                            ferrocyanide complexes.                                                         %%%                                                                             Dr. Wrighton will investigate the interaction of organometallic                 compounds with metal surfaces.  By varying the metal and the                    groups attached to it in these complexes, electronic and                        photochemical characteristics can be manipulated. This research                 is relevant to many areas of surface chemistry, such as the                     functionalization of electrodes and microelectrodes for energy                  conversion and sensors, or the synthesis, adhesion, and wetting                 of interfaces.",
