 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of fluid flow through porous rocks is vital to studies of                 groundwater hydrology and contaminant protection.  Previous work                has shown that fluid flow is controlled by factors such as                      porosity, sedimentary grain size, interparticle cement and                      interstitial mud.  Such factors can be measured easily and are                  widely used in modelling porous media.  This project aims to assess             the impact of another parameter, CRYSTAL SIZE, on fluid flow in                 dolostone aquifers.                                                             An emerging application of computer-technology, image analysis will             be developed and the results shall expand its utility within                    engineering and geosciences.  In addition, the project deals with               fundamental questions of the controls of fluid flow in natural                  materials and the effects that these controls have upon                         paleohydrology and diagenesis.  The results will help satisfy the               nation's needs for water and petroleum.                                         In siliclastic rocks, fluids flow between sedimentary particles                 that are packed together, commonly leaving large, well-connected,               interparticle pore spaces.  Cements may be precipitated into these              pore spaces, but the basic control of the fabric is depositional.               In dolostones, fluids flow between crystals that are fitted                     together in a mosaic; the pore network consists of narrow,                      sheetlike spaces.  Fluid flow in dolostones thus depends on the                 tortuosity and pore width of the intercrystalline pore system,                  which are themselves closely related to crystal size.  Crystal size             is commonly controlled by diagenetic rather than depositional                   processes.                                                                      Dolomite aquifers are commonly very finely crystalline, difficult               to analyze with a standard dissecting microscope.  Image analysis,              using core material and a dissecting microscope with slightly                   enhanced magnification, makes it possible to carry out statistical              analyses of crystal size ranges and size distributions.  These can              be correlated with other textural parameters, and with core                     analysis data.  The project will use around 30 lower San Andres                 cores in a detailed study of crystal size versus permeability and               transmissibility.",
