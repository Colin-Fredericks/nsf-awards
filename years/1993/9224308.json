 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of ethnic, social and political attitudes                  among youth in ten former republics of the Soviet Union.  It will               survey a probability sample frame of schools to assess the current              attitudes and conditions of youth and to design future studies of               social change and policy impact on this segment of society.  Topics             covered will include: strength of group identities, attitudes                   toward other nationalities, policy preferences on nationality                   issues, general political attitudes, and attitudes toward the                   commonwealth.                                                                                                                                                        Social change and ethnic relations have long been among the                central topics for sociology, and thus this study will provide a                substantial new data base for testing many social-scientific                    hypotheses.  This research will contribute greatly to our                       understanding of the tremendous changes happening in the former                 Soviet Union, and it will help scholars and policy makers                       comprehend the internal conflicts and international relations                   occurring among these newly independent states.",
