 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REPI region is part of an iron transport system-replication                 unit that we found to be conserved in bacterial plasmids carrying               the aerobactin iron transport genes.  The REPI replication region               endows the cell with incompatibility properties corresponding to                the IncFI group and must have been instrumental in the preservation             and epidemiological spread of the aerobactin system.  This replicon             is frequently found in bacterial plasmids, however little is known              on the mechanism controlling its replication and maintenance, as                well as on the mechanisms that result in the expression of the                  IncFI phenotype.  We successfully analyzed and characterized the                DNA sequences and product(s) involved in the control of replication             of REPI-containing plasmids; purified and characterized the trans-              acting protein RepI, essential for REPI replication, and dissected              the REPI incompatibility determinants.  Furthermore, we have                    recently found that the iron concentration of the cell and                      expression of the fur (ferric uptake regulation) gene are part of               a novel regulatory circuit that acts in the control of copy number              of REPI.  We are now performing structure-function studies on the               RepI protein, and analyzing the mechanism of regulation of the copy             number REPI replicons by Fur and the iron status of the cell.                   %%%                                                                             This system stands out as a model to study the regulation of                    initiation of replication and its relationship to environmental                 factors.",
