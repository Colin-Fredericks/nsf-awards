 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project on the control of asynchronous transfer mode             (ATM) networks and of optical networks.  We focus on three sets of              issues central to the operations of high speed networks:                             Traffic shaping for ATM networks                                                Multiplexing for optical networks                                                Feedback control with delayed information                                      We will use the limit results for fast and large networks to               analyze these three sets of issues.  Specifically, we will use                  fluid and diffusion limits and large deviation bounds.  For traffic             shaping we will use a new strategy (periodic averaging of rate).                We believe this strategy can reduce significantly the amount of                 queuing required inside the network, and that this strategy can                 simplify both the design and control of networks.  the multiplexing             approach that we will study for optical networks is statistical                 look-ahead multiplexing.  This multiplexing approach is designed                for star optical networks.  It uses the connectivity properties of              these networks but does not require tunable lasers or filters.  The             objectives in the study of feedback control with information delay              are to identify the feedback control strategies that can improve                the operations of high speed networks and quantify the gain                     achieved by these strategies.",
