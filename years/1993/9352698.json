This project is designed to expand this course to two semesters by introducing several new experiments as well as upgrading a few that were done previously.  In addition, equipment is being used in the Modern Physics lab that is flexible enough to support more advanced undergraduate research projects in the senior Advanced Lab course.  The experiments being developed include X-ray crystallography, the photoelectric effect, the Compton effect, gamma-ray spectros- copy, the Hall effect in germanium, measurement of the velocity of light, and holography and holographic gratings.  Experiments are also being added to the Modern Physics lab in solid state physics and modern optics, while also expanding what is being done in atomic and nuclear physics. ***",
