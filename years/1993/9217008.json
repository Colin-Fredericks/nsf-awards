 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal involves the acquisition of a videomicroscopy                      and image         analysis system for a group of                                neurobiolgists and cell biologists whose work                                   focuses on neuronal development and cell adhesion and                           motility. The components to be acquired were chosen to                          function together in different flexible combinations to                         serve the varied needs of the individual research projects.                     The capabilities include: 1) low light level observation and                    time lapse analysis of growth and plasticity of living cells                    using phase contrast, DIC or fluorescent staining, 2)                           calcium mapping in live neurons and growth cones using the                      fura-2 fluorescence        ratio image method including                         representation in pseudo color images, 3) recombining of                        images of objects present in more than one section (in                          sectioned material) or optical plane of focus (in whole                         mounts) and generating single clear images of entire 3-D                        structures, 4) superimposition of images of double (or                          triple)         fluorescent staining, obtained at different                     wavelengths, in order to better         compare the                             colocalization of immunostaining in cellular structures, 5)                     contrast         enhancement and subtraction of background                      mottle to permit DIC-video images  in real-time, 6)                             provisions for mass storage, retrieval and printing of the                      images         and the production of short time-lapse                           videotapes for demonstrations and seminars.",
